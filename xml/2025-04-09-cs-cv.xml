      <title>Semi-supervised learning for marine anomaly detection on board satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aquatic bodies face numerous environmental threats caused by several marine anomalies. Marine debris can devastate habitats and endanger marine life through entanglement, while harmful algal blooms can produce toxins that negatively affect marine ecosystems. Additionally, ships may discharge oil or engage in illegal and overfishing activities, causing further harm. These marine anomalies can be identified by applying trained deep learning (DL) models on multispectral satellite imagery. Furthermore, the detection of other anomalies, such as clouds, could be beneficial in filtering out irrelevant images. However, DL models often require a large volume of labeled data for training, which can be both costly and time-consuming, particularly for marine anomaly detection where expert annotation is needed. A potential solution is the use of semi-supervised learning methods, which can also utilize unlabeled data. In this project, we implement and study the performance of FixMatch for Semantic Segmentation, a semi-supervised algorithm for semantic segmentation. Firstly, we found that semi-supervised models perform best with a high confidence threshold of 0.9 when there is a limited amount of labeled data. Secondly, we compare the performance of semi-supervised models with fully-supervised models under varying amounts of labeled data. Our findings suggest that semi-supervised models outperform fully-supervised models with limited labeled data, while fully-supervised models have a slightly better performance with larger volumes of labeled data. We propose two hypotheses to explain why fully-supervised models surpass semi-supervised ones when a high volume of labeled data is used. All of our experiments were conducted using a U-Net model architecture with a limited number of parameters to ensure compatibility with space-rated hardware.</description>

      <title>Scalable heliostat surface predictions from focal spots: Sim-to-Real transfer of inverse Deep Learning Raytracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants are a key technology in the transition toward sustainable energy. A critical factor for their safe and efficient operation is the distribution of concentrated solar flux on the receiver. However, flux distributions from individual heliostats are sensitive to surface imperfections. Measuring these surfaces across many heliostats remains impractical in real-world deployments. As a result, control systems often assume idealized heliostat surfaces, leading to suboptimal performance and potential safety risks. To address this, inverse Deep Learning Raytracing (iDLR) has been introduced as a novel method for inferring heliostat surface profiles from target images recorded during standard calibration procedures. In this work, we present the first successful Sim-to-Real transfer of iDLR, enabling accurate surface predictions directly from real-world target images. We evaluate our method on 63 heliostats under real operational conditions. iDLR surface predictions achieve a median mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.17 mm and show good agreement with deflectometry ground truth in 84% of cases. When used in raytracing simulations, it enables flux density predictions with a mean accuracy of 90% compared to deflectometry over our dataset, and outperforms the commonly used ideal heliostat surface assumption by 26%. We tested this approach in a challenging double-extrapolation scenario-involving unseen sun positions and receiver projection-and found that iDLR maintains high predictive accuracy, highlighting its generalization capabilities. Our results demonstrate that iDLR is a scalable, automated, and cost-effective solution for integrating realistic heliostat surface models into digital twins. This opens the door to improved flux control, more precise performance modeling, and ultimately, enhanced efficiency and safety in future CSP plants.</description>

      <title>CrowdVLM-R1: Expanding R1 Ability to Vision Language Model for Crowd Counting using Fuzzy Group Relative Policy Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Fuzzy Group Relative Policy Reward (FGRPR), a novel framework that integrates Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a fuzzy reward function to enhance learning efficiency. Unlike the conventional binary 0/1 accuracy reward, our fuzzy reward model provides nuanced incentives, encouraging more precise outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that GRPO with a standard 0/1 accuracy reward underperforms compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In contrast, FGRPR, applied to Qwen2.5-VL(3B and 7B), surpasses all baseline models, including GPT4o, LLaMA2(90B), and SFT, across five in-domain datasets. On an out-of-domain dataset, FGRPR achieves performance comparable to SFT but excels when target values are larger, as its fuzzy reward function assigns higher rewards to closer approximations. This approach is broadly applicable to tasks where the precision of the answer is critical. Code and data: https://github.com/yeyimilk/CrowdVLM-R1</description>

      <title>From Keypoints to Realism: A Realistic and Accurate Virtual Try-on Network from 2D Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of image-based virtual try-on is to generate realistic images of individuals wearing target garments, ensuring that the pose, body shape and characteristics of the target garment are accurately preserved. Existing methods often fail to reproduce the fine details of target garments effectively and lack generalizability to new scenarios. In the proposed method, the person's initial garment is completely removed. Subsequently, a precise warping is performed using the predicted keypoints to fully align the target garment with the body structure and pose of the individual. Based on the warped garment, a body segmentation map is more accurately predicted. Then, using an alignment-aware segment normalization, the misaligned areas between the warped garment and the predicted garment region in the segmentation map are removed. Finally, the generator produces the final image with high visual quality, reconstructing the precise characteristics of the target garment, including its overall shape and texture. This approach emphasizes preserving garment characteristics and improving adaptability to various poses, providing better generalization for diverse applications.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Wavelet-Fourier Method for Next-Generation Conditional Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel generative modeling framework,Wavelet-Fourier-Diffusion, which adapts the diffusion paradigm to hybrid frequency representations in order to synthesize high-quality, high-fidelity images with improved spatial localization. In contrast to conventional diffusion models that rely exclusively on additive noise in pixel space, our approach leverages a multi-transform that combines wavelet sub-band decomposition with partial Fourier steps. This strategy progressively degrades and then reconstructs images in a hybrid spectral domain during the forward and reverse diffusion processes. By supplementing traditional Fourier-based analysis with the spatial localization capabilities of wavelets, our model can capture both global structures and fine-grained features more effectively. We further extend the approach to conditional image generation by integrating embeddings or conditional features via cross-attention. Experimental evaluations on CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, and a conditional ImageNet subset illustrate that our method achieves competitive or superior performance relative to baseline diffusion models and state-of-the-art GANs, as measured by Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS). We also show how the hybrid frequency-based representation improves control over global coherence and fine texture synthesis, paving the way for new directions in multi-scale generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Detection Limits and Statistical Separability of Tree Ring Watermarks in Rectified Flow-based Text-to-Image Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree-Ring Watermarking is a significant technique for authenticating AI-generated images. However, its effectiveness in rectified flow-based models remains unexplored, particularly given the inherent challenges of these models with noise latent inversion. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluated and compared the detection and separability of watermarks between SD 2.1 and FLUX.1-dev models. By analyzing various text guidance configurations and augmentation attacks, we demonstrate how inversion limitations affect both watermark recovery and the statistical separation between watermarked and unwatermarked images. Our findings provide valuable insights into the current limitations of Tree-Ring Watermarking in the current SOTA models and highlight the critical need for improved inversion methods to achieve reliable watermark detection and separability. The official implementation, dataset release and all experimental results are available at this \href{https://github.com/dsgiitr/flux-watermarking}{\textbf{link}}.</description>

      <title>Can ChatGPT Learn My Life From a Week of First-Person Video?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent improvements in generative AI and wearable camera devices (e.g. smart glasses and AI-enabled pins), I investigate the ability of foundation models to learn about the wearer's personal life through first-person camera data. To test this, I wore a camera headset for 54 hours over the course of a week, generated summaries of various lengths (e.g. minute-long, hour-long, and day-long summaries), and fine-tuned both GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini on the resulting summary hierarchy. By querying the fine-tuned models, we are able to learn what the models learned about me. The results are mixed: Both models learned basic information about me (e.g. approximate age, gender). Moreover, GPT-4o correctly deduced that I live in Pittsburgh, am a PhD student at CMU, am right-handed, and have a pet cat. However, both models also suffered from hallucination and would make up names for the individuals present in the video footage of my life.</description>

      <title>Control Map Distribution using Map Query Bank for Online Map Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable autonomous driving systems require high-definition (HD) map that contains detailed map information for planning and navigation. However, pre-build HD map requires a large cost. Visual-based Online Map Generation (OMG) has become an alternative low-cost solution to build a local HD map. Query-based BEV Transformer has been a base model for this task. This model learns HD map predictions from an initial map queries distribution which is obtained by offline optimization on training set. Besides the quality of BEV feature, the performance of this model also highly relies on the capacity of initial map query distribution. However, this distribution is limited because the limited query number. To make map predictions optimal on each test sample, it is essential to generate a suitable initial distribution for each specific scenario. This paper proposes to decompose the whole HD map distribution into a set of point representations, namely map query bank (MQBank). To build specific map query initial distributions of different scenarios, low-cost standard definition map (SD map) data is introduced as a kind of prior knowledge. Moreover, each layer of map decoder network learns instance-level map query features, which will lose detailed information of each point. However, BEV feature map is a point-level dense feature. It is important to keep point-level information in map queries when interacting with BEV feature map. This can also be solved with map query bank method. Final experiments show a new insight on SD map prior and a new record on OpenLaneV2 benchmark with 40.5%, 45.7% mAP on vehicle lane and pedestrian area.</description>

      <title>3D Scene Understanding Through Local Random Access Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D scene understanding from single images is a pivotal problem in computer vision with numerous downstream applications in graphics, augmented reality, and robotics. While diffusion-based modeling approaches have shown promise, they often struggle to maintain object and scene consistency, especially in complex real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an autoregressive generative approach called Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) modeling, which uses local patch quantization and randomly ordered sequence generation. By utilizing optical flow as an intermediate representation for 3D scene editing, our experiments demonstrate that LRAS achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis and 3D object manipulation capabilities. Furthermore, we show that our framework naturally extends to self-supervised depth estimation through a simple modification of the sequence design. By achieving strong performance on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, LRAS provides a unified and effective framework for building the next generation of 3D vision models.</description>

      <title>WildGS-SLAM: Monocular Gaussian Splatting SLAM in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present WildGS-SLAM, a robust and efficient monocular RGB SLAM system designed to handle dynamic environments by leveraging uncertainty-aware geometric mapping. Unlike traditional SLAM systems, which assume static scenes, our approach integrates depth and uncertainty information to enhance tracking, mapping, and rendering performance in the presence of moving objects. We introduce an uncertainty map, predicted by a shallow multi-layer perceptron and DINOv2 features, to guide dynamic object removal during both tracking and mapping. This uncertainty map enhances dense bundle adjustment and Gaussian map optimization, improving reconstruction accuracy. Our system is evaluated on multiple datasets and demonstrates artifact-free view synthesis. Results showcase WildGS-SLAM's superior performance in dynamic environments compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Gait Patterns as Biomarkers: An attention-guided Deep Multiple Instance Learning Network for Scoliosis Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scoliosis is a spinal curvature disorder that is difficult to detect early and can compress the chest cavity, impacting respiratory function and cardiac health. Especially for adolescents, delayed detection and treatment result in worsening compression. Traditional scoliosis detection methods heavily rely on clinical expertise, and X-ray imaging poses radiation risks, limiting large-scale early screening. We propose an Attention-Guided Deep Multi-Instance Learning method (Gait-MIL) to effectively capture discriminative features from gait patterns, which is inspired by ScoNet-MT's pioneering use of gait patterns for scoliosis detection. We evaluate our method on the first large-scale dataset based on gait patterns for scoliosis classification. The results demonstrate that our study improves the performance of using gait as a biomarker for scoliosis detection, significantly enhances detection accuracy for the particularly challenging Neutral cases, where subtle indicators are often overlooked. Our Gait-MIL also performs robustly in imbalanced scenarios, making it a promising tool for large-scale scoliosis screening.</description>

      <title>Improving Brain Disorder Diagnosis with Advanced Brain Function Representation and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying functional connectivity (FC), a vital metric for the diagnosis of various brain disorders, traditionally relies on the use of a pre-defined brain atlas. However, using such atlases can lead to issues regarding selection bias and lack of regard for specificity. Addressing this, we propose a novel transformer-based classification network (AFBR-KAN) with effective brain function representation to aid in diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD). AFBR-KAN leverages Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) blocks replacing traditional multi-layer perceptron (MLP) components. Thorough experimentation reveals the effectiveness of AFBR-KAN in improving the diagnosis of ASD under various configurations of the model architecture. Our code is available at https://github.com/tbwa233/ABFR-KAN</description>

      <title>ProbRes: Probabilistic Jump Diffusion for Open-World Egocentric Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-world egocentric activity recognition poses a fundamental challenge due to its unconstrained nature, requiring models to infer unseen activities from an expansive, partially observed search space. We introduce ProbRes, a Probabilistic Residual search framework based on jump-diffusion that efficiently navigates this space by balancing prior-guided exploration with likelihood-driven exploitation. Our approach integrates structured commonsense priors to construct a semantically coherent search space, adaptively refines predictions using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and employs a stochastic search mechanism to locate high-likelihood activity labels while minimizing exhaustive enumeration efficiently. We systematically evaluate ProbRes across multiple openness levels (L0 - L3), demonstrating its adaptability to increasing search space complexity. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets (GTEA Gaze, GTEA Gaze+, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charades-Ego), we establish a clear taxonomy for open-world recognition, delineating the challenges and methodological advancements necessary for egocentric activity understanding. Our results highlight the importance of structured search strategies, paving the way for scalable and efficient open-world activity recognition.</description>

      <title>TGraphX: Tensor-Aware Graph Neural Network for Multi-Dimensional Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TGraphX presents a novel paradigm in deep learning by unifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance visual reasoning tasks. Traditional CNNs excel at extracting rich spatial features from images but lack the inherent capability to model inter-object relationships. Conversely, conventional GNNs typically rely on flattened node features, thereby discarding vital spatial details. TGraphX overcomes these limitations by employing CNNs to generate multi-dimensional node features (e.g., (3*128*128) tensors) that preserve local spatial semantics. These spatially aware nodes participate in a graph where message passing is performed using 1*1 convolutions, which fuse adjacent features while maintaining their structure. Furthermore, a deep CNN aggregator with residual connections is used to robustly refine the fused messages, ensuring stable gradient flow and end-to-end trainability. Our approach not only bridges the gap between spatial feature extraction and relational reasoning but also demonstrates significant improvements in object detection refinement and ensemble reasoning.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce VideoComp, a benchmark and learning framework for advancing video-text compositionality understanding, aimed at improving vision-language models (VLMs) in fine-grained temporal alignment. Unlike existing benchmarks focused on static image-text compositionality or isolated single-event videos, our benchmark targets alignment in continuous multi-event videos. Leveraging video-text datasets with temporally localized event captions (e.g. ActivityNet-Captions, YouCook2), we construct two compositional benchmarks, ActivityNet-Comp and YouCook2-Comp. We create challenging negative samples with subtle temporal disruptions such as reordering, action word replacement, partial captioning, and combined disruptions. These benchmarks comprehensively test models' compositional sensitivity across extended, cohesive video-text sequences. To improve model performance, we propose a hierarchical pairwise preference loss that strengthens alignment with temporally accurate pairs and gradually penalizes increasingly disrupted ones, encouraging fine-grained compositional learning. To mitigate the limited availability of densely annotated video data, we introduce a pretraining strategy that concatenates short video-caption pairs to simulate multi-event sequences. We evaluate video-text foundational models and large multimodal models (LMMs) on our benchmark, identifying both strengths and areas for improvement in compositionality. Overall, our work provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and enhancing model capabilities in achieving fine-grained, temporally coherent video-text alignment.</description>

      <title>Edge Approximation Text Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pursuing efficient text shape representations helps scene text detection models focus on compact foreground regions and optimize the contour reconstruction steps to simplify the whole detection pipeline. Current approaches either represent irregular shapes via box-to-polygon strategy or decomposing a contour into pieces for fitting gradually, the deficiency of coarse contours or complex pipelines always exists in these models. Considering the above issues, we introduce EdgeText to fit text contours compactly while alleviating excessive contour rebuilding processes. Concretely, it is observed that the two long edges of texts can be regarded as smooth curves. It allows us to build contours via continuous and smooth edges that cover text regions tightly instead of fitting piecewise, which helps avoid the two limitations in current models. Inspired by this observation, EdgeText formulates the text representation as the edge approximation problem via parameterized curve fitting functions. In the inference stage, our model starts with locating text centers, and then creating curve functions for approximating text edges relying on the points. Meanwhile, truncation points are determined based on the location features. In the end, extracting curve segments from curve functions by using the pixel coordinate information brought by truncation points to reconstruct text contours. Furthermore, considering the deep dependency of EdgeText on text edges, a bilateral enhanced perception (BEP) module is designed. It encourages our model to pay attention to the recognition of edge features. Additionally, to accelerate the learning of the curve function parameters, we introduce a proportional integral loss (PI-loss) to force the proposed model to focus on the curve distribution and avoid being disturbed by text scales.</description>

      <title>DiTaiListener: Controllable High Fidelity Listener Video Generation with Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating naturalistic and nuanced listener motions for extended interactions remains an open problem. Existing methods often rely on low-dimensional motion codes for facial behavior generation followed by photorealistic rendering, limiting both visual fidelity and expressive richness. To address these challenges, we introduce DiTaiListener, powered by a video diffusion model with multimodal conditions. Our approach first generates short segments of listener responses conditioned on the speaker's speech and facial motions with DiTaiListener-Gen. It then refines the transitional frames via DiTaiListener-Edit for a seamless transition. Specifically, DiTaiListener-Gen adapts a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) for the task of listener head portrait generation by introducing a Causal Temporal Multimodal Adapter (CTM-Adapter) to process speakers' auditory and visual cues. CTM-Adapter integrates speakers' input in a causal manner into the video generation process to ensure temporally coherent listener responses. For long-form video generation, we introduce DiTaiListener-Edit, a transition refinement video-to-video diffusion model. The model fuses video segments into smooth and continuous videos, ensuring temporal consistency in facial expressions and image quality when merging short video segments produced by DiTaiListener-Gen. Quantitatively, DiTaiListener achieves the state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets in both photorealism (+73.8% in FID on RealTalk) and motion representation (+6.1% in FD metric on VICO) spaces. User studies confirm the superior performance of DiTaiListener, with the model being the clear preference in terms of feedback, diversity, and smoothness, outperforming competitors by a significant margin.</description>

      <title>Detection-Friendly Nonuniformity Correction: A Union Framework for Infrared UAVTarget Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images captured using thermal detectors are often affected by temperature dependent low-frequency nonuniformity, which significantly reduces the contrast of the images. Detecting UAV targets under nonuniform conditions is crucial in UAV surveillance applications. Existing methods typically treat infrared nonuniformity correction (NUC) as a preprocessing step for detection, which leads to suboptimal performance. Balancing the two tasks while enhancing detection beneficial information remains challenging. In this paper, we present a detection-friendly union framework, termed UniCD, that simultaneously addresses both infrared NUC and UAV target detection tasks in an end-to-end manner. We first model NUC as a small number of parameter estimation problem jointly driven by priors and data to generate detection-conducive images. Then, we incorporate a new auxiliary loss with target mask supervision into the backbone of the infrared UAV target detection network to strengthen target features while suppressing the background. To better balance correction and detection, we introduce a detection-guided self-supervised loss to reduce feature discrepancies between the two tasks, thereby enhancing detection robustness to varying nonuniformity levels. Additionally, we construct a new benchmark composed of 50,000 infrared images in various nonuniformity types, multi-scale UAV targets and rich backgrounds with target annotations, called IRBFD. Extensive experiments on IRBFD demonstrate that our UniCD is a robust union framework for NUC and UAV target detection while achieving real-time processing capabilities.

      <title>Window Token Concatenation for Efficient Visual Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To effectively reduce the visual tokens in Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs), we propose a novel approach called Window Token Concatenation (WiCo). Specifically, we employ a sliding window to concatenate spatially adjacent visual tokens. However, directly concatenating these tokens may group diverse tokens into one, and thus obscure some fine details. To address this challenge, we propose fine-tuning the last few layers of the vision encoder to adaptively adjust the visual tokens, encouraging that those within the same window exhibit similar features. To further enhance the performance on fine-grained visual understanding tasks, we introduce WiCo+, which decomposes the visual tokens in later layers of the LLM. Such a design enjoys the merits of the large perception field of the LLM for fine-grained visual understanding while keeping a small number of visual tokens for efficient inference. We perform extensive experiments on both coarse- and fine-grained visual understanding tasks based on LLaVA-1.5 and Shikra, showing better performance compared with existing token reduction projectors. The code is available: https://github.com/JackYFL/WiCo.</description>

      <title>Artificial intelligence application in lymphoma diagnosis: from Convolutional Neural Network to Vision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, vision transformers were shown to be capable of outperforming convolutional neural networks when pretrained on sufficiently large datasets. Vision transformer models show good accuracy on large scale datasets, with features of multi-modal training. Due to their promising feature detection, we aim to explore vision transformer models for diagnosis of anaplastic large cell lymphoma versus classical Hodgkin lymphoma using pathology whole slide images of HE slides. We compared the classification performance of the vision transformer to our previously designed convolutional neural network on the same dataset. The dataset includes whole slide images of HE slides for 20 cases, including 10 cases in each diagnostic category. From each whole slide image, 60 image patches having size of 100 by 100 pixels and at magnification of 20 were obtained to yield 1200 image patches, from which 90 percent were used for training, 9 percent for validation, and 10 percent for testing. The test results from the convolutional neural network model had previously shown an excellent diagnostic accuracy of 100 percent. The test results from the vision transformer model also showed a comparable accuracy at 100 percent. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first direct comparison of predictive performance between a vision transformer model and a convolutional neural network model using the same dataset of lymphoma. Overall, convolutional neural network has a more mature architecture than vision transformer and is usually the best choice when large scale pretraining is not an available option. Nevertheless, our current study shows comparable and excellent accuracy of vision transformer compared to that of convolutional neural network even with a relatively small dataset of anaplastic large cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Motion And Noise Estimation with Event Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras are emerging vision sensors, whose noise is challenging to characterize. Existing denoising methods for event cameras consider other tasks such as motion estimation separately (i.e., sequentially after denoising). However, motion is an intrinsic part of event data, since scene edges cannot be sensed without motion. This work proposes, to the best of our knowledge, the first method that simultaneously estimates motion in its various forms (e.g., ego-motion, optical flow) and noise. The method is flexible, as it allows replacing the 1-step motion estimation of the widely-used Contrast Maximization framework with any other motion estimator, such as deep neural networks. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the E-MLB denoising benchmark and competitive results on the DND21 benchmark, while showing its efficacy on motion estimation and intensity reconstruction tasks. We believe that the proposed approach contributes to strengthening the theory of event-data denoising, as well as impacting practical denoising use-cases, as we release the code upon acceptance.

      <title>UCS: A Universal Model for Curvilinear Structure Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curvilinear structure segmentation (CSS) is vital in various domains, including medical imaging, landscape analysis, industrial surface inspection, and plant analysis. While existing methods achieve high performance within specific domains, their generalizability is limited. On the other hand, large-scale models such as Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibit strong generalization but are not optimized for curvilinear structures. Existing adaptations of SAM primarily focus on general object segmentation and lack specialized design for CSS tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose the Universal Curvilinear structure Segmentation (\textit{UCS}) model, which adapts SAM to CSS tasks while enhancing its generalization. \textit{UCS} features a novel encoder architecture integrating a pretrained SAM encoder with two innovations: a Sparse Adapter, strategically inserted to inherit the pre-trained SAM encoder's generalization capability while minimizing the number of fine-tuning parameters, and a Prompt Generation module, which leverages Fast Fourier Transform with a high-pass filter to generate curve-specific prompts. Furthermore, the \textit{UCS} incorporates a mask decoder that eliminates reliance on manual interaction through a dual-compression module: a Hierarchical Feature Compression module, which aggregates the outputs of the sampled encoder to enhance detail preservation, and a Guidance Feature Compression module, which extracts and compresses image-driven guidance features. Evaluated on a comprehensive multi-domain dataset, including an in-house dataset covering eight natural curvilinear structures, \textit{UCS} demonstrates state-of-the-art generalization and open-set segmentation performance across medical, engineering, natural, and plant imagery, establishing a new benchmark for universal CSS.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Pathology Foundation Model: Progress and Future Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational pathology, analyzing whole slide images for automated cancer diagnosis, relies on the multiple instance learning framework where performance heavily depends on the feature extractor and aggregator. Recent Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs), pretrained on large-scale histopathology data, have significantly enhanced capabilities of extractors and aggregators but lack systematic analysis frameworks. This survey presents a hierarchical taxonomy organizing PFMs through a top-down philosophy that can be utilized to analyze FMs in any domain: model scope, model pretraining, and model design. Additionally, we systematically categorize PFM evaluation tasks into slide-level, patch-level, multimodal, and biological tasks, providing comprehensive benchmarking criteria. Our analysis identifies critical challenges in both PFM development (pathology-specific methodology, end-to-end pretraining, data-model scalability) and utilization (effective adaptation, model maintenance), paving the way for future directions in this promising field.

      <title>Can You Count to Nine? A Human Evaluation Benchmark for Counting Limits in Modern Text-to-Video Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have driven significant progress in a variety of AI tasks, including text-to-video generation, where models like Video LDM and Stable Video Diffusion can produce realistic, movie-level videos from textual instructions. Despite these advances, current text-to-video models still face fundamental challenges in reliably following human commands, particularly in adhering to simple numerical constraints. In this work, we present T2VCountBench, a specialized benchmark aiming at evaluating the counting capability of SOTA text-to-video models as of 2025. Our benchmark employs rigorous human evaluations to measure the number of generated objects and covers a diverse range of generators, covering both open-source and commercial models. Extensive experiments reveal that all existing models struggle with basic numerical tasks, almost always failing to generate videos with an object count of 9 or fewer. Furthermore, our comprehensive ablation studies explore how factors like video style, temporal dynamics, and multilingual inputs may influence counting performance. We also explore prompt refinement techniques and demonstrate that decomposing the task into smaller subtasks does not easily alleviate these limitations. Our findings highlight important challenges in current text-to-video generation and provide insights for future research aimed at improving adherence to basic numerical constraints.</description>

      <title>UniRVQA: A Unified Framework for Retrieval-Augmented Vision Question Answering via Self-Reflective Joint Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge-based Vision Question Answering (KB-VQA) systems address complex visual-grounded questions requiring external knowledge, such as web-sourced encyclopedia articles. Existing methods often use sequential and separate frameworks for the retriever and the generator with limited parametric knowledge sharing. However, since both retrieval and generation tasks require accurate understanding of contextual and external information, such separation can potentially lead to suboptimal system performance. Another key challenge is the integration of multimodal information. General-purpose multimodal pre-trained models, while adept at multimodal representation learning, struggle with fine-grained retrieval required for knowledge-intensive visual questions. Recent specialized pre-trained models mitigate the issue, but are computationally expensive. To bridge the gap, we propose a Unified Retrieval-Augmented VQA framework (UniRVQA). UniRVQA adapts general multimodal pre-trained models for fine-grained knowledge-intensive tasks within a unified framework, enabling cross-task parametric knowledge sharing and the extension of existing multimodal representation learning capability. We further introduce a reflective-answering mechanism that allows the model to explicitly evaluate and refine its knowledge boundary. Additionally, we integrate late interaction into the retrieval-augmented generation joint training process to enhance fine-grained understanding of queries and documents. Our approach achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art models, delivering a significant 4.7% improvement in answering accuracy, and brings an average 7.5% boost in base MLLMs' VQA performance.</description>

      <title>DocSAM: Unified Document Image Segmentation via Query Decomposition and Heterogeneous Mixed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document image segmentation is crucial for document analysis and recognition but remains challenging due to the diversity of document formats and segmentation tasks. Existing methods often address these tasks separately, resulting in limited generalization and resource wastage. This paper introduces DocSAM, a transformer-based unified framework designed for various document image segmentation tasks, such as document layout analysis, multi-granularity text segmentation, and table structure recognition, by modelling these tasks as a combination of instance and semantic segmentation. Specifically, DocSAM employs Sentence-BERT to map category names from each dataset into semantic queries that match the dimensionality of instance queries. These two sets of queries interact through an attention mechanism and are cross-attended with image features to predict instance and semantic segmentation masks. Instance categories are predicted by computing the dot product between instance and semantic queries, followed by softmax normalization of scores. Consequently, DocSAM can be jointly trained on heterogeneous datasets, enhancing robustness and generalization while reducing computational and storage resources. Comprehensive evaluations show that DocSAM surpasses existing methods in accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability, highlighting its potential for advancing document image understanding and segmentation across various applications. Codes are available at https://github.com/xhli-git/DocSAM.</description>

      <title>TARAC: Mitigating Hallucination in LVLMs via Temporal Attention Real-time Accumulative Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks; however, the challenge of hallucinations constrains their practical applications. The hallucination problem arises from multiple factors, including the inherent hallucinations in language models, the limitations of visual encoders in perception, and biases introduced by multimodal data. Extensive research has explored ways to mitigate hallucinations. For instance, OPERA prevents the model from overly focusing on "anchor tokens", thereby reducing hallucinations, whereas VCD mitigates hallucinations by employing a contrastive decoding approach. In this paper, we investigate the correlation between the decay of attention to image tokens and the occurrence of hallucinations. Based on this finding, we propose Temporal Attention Real-time Accumulative Connection (TARAC), a novel training-free method that dynamically accumulates and updates LVLMs' attention on image tokens during generation. By enhancing the model's attention to image tokens, TARAC mitigates hallucinations caused by the decay of attention on image tokens. We validate the effectiveness of TARAC across multiple models and datasets, demonstrating that our approach substantially mitigates hallucinations. In particular, TARAC reduces $C_S$ by 25.2 and $C_I$ by 8.7 compared to VCD on the CHAIR benchmark.</description>

      <title>EMF: Event Meta Formers for Event-based Real-time Traffic Object Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras have higher temporal resolution, and require less storage and bandwidth compared to traditional RGB cameras. However, due to relatively lagging performance of event-based approaches, event cameras have not yet replace traditional cameras in performance-critical applications like autonomous driving. Recent approaches in event-based object detection try to bridge this gap by employing computationally expensive transformer-based solutions. However, due to their resource-intensive components, these solutions fail to exploit the sparsity and higher temporal resolution of event cameras efficiently. Moreover, these solutions are adopted from the vision domain, lacking specificity to the event cameras. In this work, we explore efficient and performant alternatives to recurrent vision transformer models and propose a novel event-based object detection backbone. The proposed backbone employs a novel Event Progression Extractor module, tailored specifically for event data, and uses Metaformer concept with convolution-based efficient components. We evaluate the resultant model on well-established traffic object detection benchmarks and conduct cross-dataset evaluation to test its ability to generalize. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art on Prophesee Gen1 dataset by 1.6 mAP while reducing inference time by 14%. Our proposed EMF becomes the fastest DNN-based architecture in the domain by outperforming most efficient event-based object detectors. Moreover, the proposed model shows better ability to generalize to unseen data and scales better with the abundance of data.</description>

      <title>Multi-identity Human Image Animation with Structural Video Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating human videos from a single image while ensuring high visual quality and precise control is a challenging task, especially in complex scenarios involving multiple individuals and interactions with objects. Existing methods, while effective for single-human cases, often fail to handle the intricacies of multi-identity interactions because they struggle to associate the correct pairs of human appearance and pose condition and model the distribution of 3D-aware dynamics. To address these limitations, we present Structural Video Diffusion, a novel framework designed for generating realistic multi-human videos. Our approach introduces two core innovations: identity-specific embeddings to maintain consistent appearances across individuals and a structural learning mechanism that incorporates depth and surface-normal cues to model human-object interactions. Additionally, we expand existing human video dataset with 25K new videos featuring diverse multi-human and object interaction scenarios, providing a robust foundation for training. Experimental results demonstrate that Structural Video Diffusion achieves superior performance in generating lifelike, coherent videos for multiple subjects with dynamic and rich interactions, advancing the state of human-centric video generation.</description>

      <title>Scaling Federated Learning Solutions with Kubernetes for Synthesizing Histopathology Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of deep learning, large architectures often obtain the best performance for many tasks, but also require massive datasets. In the histological domain, tissue images are expensive to obtain and constitute sensitive medical information, raising concerns about data scarcity and privacy. Vision Transformers are state-of-the-art computer vision models that have proven helpful in many tasks, including image classification. In this work, we combine vision Transformers with generative adversarial networks to generate histopathological images related to colorectal cancer and test their quality by augmenting a training dataset, leading to improved classification accuracy. Then, we replicate this performance using the federated learning technique and a realistic Kubernetes setup with multiple nodes, simulating a scenario where the training dataset is split among several hospitals unable to share their information directly due to privacy concerns.</description>

      <title>CoMBO: Conflict Mitigation via Branched Optimization for Class Incremental Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective Class Incremental Segmentation (CIS) requires simultaneously mitigating catastrophic forgetting and ensuring sufficient plasticity to integrate new classes. The inherent conflict above often leads to a back-and-forth, which turns the objective into finding the balance between the performance of previous~(old) and incremental~(new) classes. To address this conflict, we introduce a novel approach, Conflict Mitigation via Branched Optimization~(CoMBO). Within this approach, we present the Query Conflict Reduction module, designed to explicitly refine queries for new classes through lightweight, class-specific adapters. This module provides an additional branch for the acquisition of new classes while preserving the original queries for distillation. Moreover, we develop two strategies to further mitigate the conflict following the branched structure, \textit{i.e.}, the Half-Learning Half-Distillation~(HDHL) over classification probabilities, and the Importance-Based Knowledge Distillation~(IKD) over query features. HDHL selectively engages in learning for classification probabilities of queries that match the ground truth of new classes, while aligning unmatched ones to the corresponding old probabilities, thus ensuring retention of old knowledge while absorbing new classes via learning negative samples. Meanwhile, IKD assesses the importance of queries based on their matching degree to old classes, prioritizing the distillation of important features and allowing less critical features to evolve. Extensive experiments in Class Incremental Panoptic and Semantic Segmentation settings have demonstrated the superior performance of CoMBO.

      <title>JarvisIR: Elevating Autonomous Driving Perception with Intelligent Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-centric perception systems struggle with unpredictable and coupled weather degradations in the wild. Current solutions are often limited, as they either depend on specific degradation priors or suffer from significant domain gaps. To enable robust and autonomous operation in real-world conditions, we propose JarvisIR, a VLM-powered agent that leverages the VLM as a controller to manage multiple expert restoration models. To further enhance system robustness, reduce hallucinations, and improve generalizability in real-world adverse weather, JarvisIR employs a novel two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning and human feedback alignment. Specifically, to address the lack of paired data in real-world scenarios, the human feedback alignment enables the VLM to be fine-tuned effectively on large-scale real-world data in an unsupervised manner. To support the training and evaluation of JarvisIR, we introduce CleanBench, a comprehensive dataset consisting of high-quality and large-scale instruction-responses pairs, including 150K synthetic entries and 80K real entries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JarvisIR exhibits superior decision-making and restoration capabilities. Compared with existing methods, it achieves a 50% improvement in the average of all perception metrics on CleanBench-Real. Project page: https://cvpr2025-jarvisir.github.io/.</description>

      <title>SDEIT: Semantic-Driven Electrical Impedance Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regularization methods using prior knowledge are essential in solving ill-posed inverse problems such as Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). However, designing effective regularization and integrating prior information into EIT remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of anatomical structures. In this work, we introduce SDEIT, a novel semantic-driven framework that integrates Stable Diffusion 3.5 into EIT, marking the first use of large-scale text-to-image generation models in EIT. SDEIT employs natural language prompts as semantic priors to guide the reconstruction process. By coupling an implicit neural representation (INR) network with a plug-and-play optimization scheme that leverages SD-generated images as generative priors, SDEIT improves structural consistency and recovers fine details. Importantly, this method does not rely on paired training datasets, increasing its adaptability to varied EIT scenarios. Extensive experiments on both simulated and experimental data demonstrate that SDEIT outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, offering superior accuracy and robustness. This work opens a new pathway for integrating multimodal priors into ill-posed inverse problems like EIT.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Single-View 3D Gaussian Splatting using Unsupervised Hierarchical Disentangled Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently marked a significant advancement in 3D reconstruction, delivering both rapid rendering and high-quality results. However, existing 3DGS methods pose challenges in understanding underlying 3D semantics, which hinders model controllability and interpretability. To address it, we propose an interpretable single-view 3DGS framework, termed 3DisGS, to discover both coarse- and fine-grained 3D semantics via hierarchical disentangled representation learning (DRL). Specifically, the model employs a dual-branch architecture, consisting of a point cloud initialization branch and a triplane-Gaussian generation branch, to achieve coarse-grained disentanglement by separating 3D geometry and visual appearance features. Subsequently, fine-grained semantic representations within each modality are further discovered through DRL-based encoder-adapters. To our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve unsupervised interpretable 3DGS. Evaluations indicate that our model achieves 3D disentanglement while preserving high-quality and rapid reconstruction.</description>

      <title>GROVE: A Generalized Reward for Learning Open-Vocabulary Physical Skill</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning open-vocabulary physical skills for simulated agents presents a significant challenge in artificial intelligence. Current reinforcement learning approaches face critical limitations: manually designed rewards lack scalability across diverse tasks, while demonstration-based methods struggle to generalize beyond their training distribution. We introduce GROVE, a generalized reward framework that enables open-vocabulary physical skill learning without manual engineering or task-specific demonstrations. Our key insight is that Large Language Models(LLMs) and Vision Language Models(VLMs) provide complementary guidance -- LLMs generate precise physical constraints capturing task requirements, while VLMs evaluate motion semantics and naturalness. Through an iterative design process, VLM-based feedback continuously refines LLM-generated constraints, creating a self-improving reward system. To bridge the domain gap between simulation and natural images, we develop Pose2CLIP, a lightweight mapper that efficiently projects agent poses directly into semantic feature space without computationally expensive rendering. Extensive experiments across diverse embodiments and learning paradigms demonstrate GROVE's effectiveness, achieving 22.2% higher motion naturalness and 25.7% better task completion scores while training 8.4x faster than previous methods. These results establish a new foundation for scalable physical skill acquisition in simulated environments.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Grouped Structural Global Pruning of Vision Transformers on Domain Generalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing sizes of AI models like large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers, deploying them on devices with limited computational resources is a significant challenge particularly when addressing domain generalisation (DG) tasks. This paper introduces a novel grouped structural pruning method for pre-trained vision transformers (ViT, BeiT, and DeiT), evaluated on the PACS and Office-Home DG benchmarks. Our method uses dependency graph analysis to identify and remove redundant groups of neurons, weights, filters, or attention heads within transformers, using a range of selection metrics. Grouped structural pruning is applied at pruning ratios of 50\%, 75\% and 95\% and the models are then fine-tuned on selected distributions from DG benchmarks to evaluate their overall performance in DG tasks. Results show significant improvements in inference speed and fine-tuning time with minimal trade-offs in accuracy and DG task performance. For instance, on the PACS benchmark, pruning ViT, BeiT, and DeiT models by 50\% using the Hessian metric resulted in accuracy drops of only -2.94\%, -1.42\%, and -1.72\%, respectively, while achieving speed boosts of 2.5x, 1.81x, and 2.15x. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in balancing model efficiency with domain generalisation performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have remarkably progressed in analyzing and understanding images. Despite these advancements, accurately regressing values in charts remains an underexplored area for MLLMs. For visualization, how do MLLMs perform when applied to graphical perception tasks? Our paper investigates this question by reproducing Cleveland and McGill's seminal 1984 experiment and comparing it against human task performance. Our study primarily evaluates fine-tuned and pretrained models and zero-shot prompting to determine if they closely match human graphical perception. Our findings highlight that MLLMs outperform human task performance in some cases but not in others. We highlight the results of all experiments to foster an understanding of where MLLMs succeed and fail when applied to data visualization.</description>

      <title>Resilience of Vision Transformers for Domain Generalisation in the Presence of Out-of-Distribution Noisy Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern AI models excel in controlled settings but often fail in real-world scenarios where data distributions shift unpredictably - a challenge known as domain generalisation (DG). This paper tackles this limitation by rigorously evaluating vision tramsformers, specifically the BEIT architecture which is a model pre-trained with masked image modelling (MIM), against synthetic out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks designed to mimic real-world noise and occlusions. We introduce a novel framework to generate OOD test cases by strategically masking object regions in images using grid patterns (25\%, 50\%, 75\% occlusion) and leveraging cutting-edge zero-shot segmentation via Segment Anything and Grounding DINO to ensure precise object localisation. Experiments across three benchmarks (PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet) demonstrate BEIT's known robustness while maintaining 94\% accuracy on PACS and 87\% on Office-Home, despite significant occlusions, outperforming CNNs and other vision transformers by margins of up to 37\%. Analysis of self-attention distances reveals that the BEIT dependence on global features correlates with its resilience. Furthermore, our synthetic benchmarks expose critical failure modes: performance degrades sharply when occlusions disrupt object shapes e.g. 68\% drop for external grid masking vs. 22\% for internal masking. This work provides two key advances (1) a scalable method to generate OOD benchmarks using controllable noise, and (2) empirical evidence that MIM and self-attention mechanism in vision transformers enhance DG by learning invariant features. These insights bridge the gap between lab-trained models and real-world deployment that offer a blueprint for building AI systems that generalise reliably under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Progressive Multi-Source Domain Adaptation for Personalized Facial Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized facial expression recognition (FER) involves adapting a machine learning model using samples from labeled sources and unlabeled target domains. Given the challenges of recognizing subtle expressions with considerable interpersonal variability, state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods focus on the multi-source UDA (MSDA) setting, where each domain corresponds to a specific subject, and improve model accuracy and robustness. However, when adapting to a specific target, the diverse nature of multiple source domains translates to a large shift between source and target data. State-of-the-art MSDA methods for FER address this domain shift by considering all the sources to adapt to the target representations. Nevertheless, adapting to a target subject presents significant challenges due to large distributional differences between source and target domains, often resulting in negative transfer. In addition, integrating all sources simultaneously increases computational costs and causes misalignment with the target. To address these issues, we propose a progressive MSDA approach that gradually introduces information from subjects based on their similarity to the target subject. This will ensure that only the most relevant sources from the target are selected, which helps avoid the negative transfer caused by dissimilar sources. We first exploit the closest sources to reduce the distribution shift with the target and then move towards the furthest while only considering the most relevant sources based on the predetermined threshold. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting caused by the incremental introduction of source subjects, we implemented a density-based memory mechanism that preserves the most relevant historical source samples for adaptation. Our experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed method on pain datasets: Biovid and UNBC-McMaster.</description>

      <title>ADA-Net: Attention-Guided Domain Adaptation Network with Contrastive Learning for Standing Dead Tree Segmentation Using Aerial Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information on standing dead trees is important for understanding forest ecosystem functioning and resilience but has been lacking over large geographic regions. Climate change has caused large-scale tree mortality events that can remain undetected due to limited data. In this study, we propose a novel method for segmenting standing dead trees using aerial multispectral orthoimages. Because access to annotated datasets has been a significant problem in forest remote sensing due to the need for forest expertise, we introduce a method for domain transfer by leveraging domain adaptation to learn a transformation from a source domain X to target domain Y. In this Image-to-Image translation task, we aim to utilize available annotations in the target domain by pre-training a segmentation network. When images from a new study site without annotations are introduced (source domain X), these images are transformed into the target domain. Then, transfer learning is applied by inferring the pre-trained network on domain-adapted images. In addition to investigating the feasibility of current domain adaptation approaches for this objective, we propose a novel approach called the Attention-guided Domain Adaptation Network (ADA-Net) with enhanced contrastive learning. Accordingly, the ADA-Net approach provides new state-of-the-art domain adaptation performance levels outperforming existing approaches. We have evaluated the proposed approach using two datasets from Finland and the US. The USA images are converted to the Finland domain, and we show that the synthetic USA2Finland dataset exhibits similar characteristics to the Finland domain images. The software implementation is shared at https://github.com/meteahishali/ADA-Net. The data is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meteahishali/aerial-imagery-for-standing-dead-tree-segmentation.</description>

      <title>3R-GS: Best Practice in Optimizing Camera Poses Along with 3DGS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized neural rendering with its efficiency and quality, but like many novel view synthesis methods, it heavily depends on accurate camera poses from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) systems. Although recent SfM pipelines have made impressive progress, questions remain about how to further improve both their robust performance in challenging conditions (e.g., textureless scenes) and the precision of camera parameter estimation simultaneously. We present 3R-GS, a 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges this gap by jointly optimizing 3D Gaussians and camera parameters from large reconstruction priors MASt3R-SfM. We note that naively performing joint 3D Gaussian and camera optimization faces two challenges: the sensitivity to the quality of SfM initialization, and its limited capacity for global optimization, leading to suboptimal reconstruction results. Our 3R-GS, overcomes these issues by incorporating optimized practices, enabling robust scene reconstruction even with imperfect camera registration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3R-GS delivers high-quality novel view synthesis and precise camera pose estimation while remaining computationally efficient.

      <title>MedM-VL: What Makes a Good Medical LVLM?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image analysis is a fundamental component. As deep learning progresses, the focus has shifted from single-task applications, such as classification and segmentation, to more complex multimodal tasks, including medical visual question answering and report generation. Traditional shallow and task-specific models are increasingly limited in addressing the complexity and scalability required in clinical practice. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has driven the development of medical Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), offering a unified solution for diverse vision-language tasks. In this study, we investigate various architectural designs for medical LVLMs based on the widely adopted LLaVA framework, which follows an encoder-connector-LLM paradigm. We construct two distinct models targeting 2D and 3D modalities, respectively. These models are designed to support both general-purpose medical tasks and domain-specific fine-tuning, thereby serving as effective foundation models. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we develop a modular and extensible codebase, MedM-VL, and release two LVLM variants: MedM-VL-2D for 2D medical image analysis and MedM-VL-CT-Chest for 3D CT-based applications.

      <title>NCL-CIR: Noise-aware Contrastive Learning for Composed Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) seeks to find a target image using a multi-modal query, which combines an image with modification text to pinpoint the target. While recent CIR methods have shown promise, they mainly focus on exploring relationships between the query pairs (image and text) through data augmentation or model design. These methods often assume perfect alignment between queries and target images, an idealized scenario rarely encountered in practice. In reality, pairs are often partially or completely mismatched due to issues like inaccurate modification texts, low-quality target images, and annotation errors. Ignoring these mismatches leads to numerous False Positive Pair (FFPs) denoted as noise pairs in the dataset, causing the model to overfit and ultimately reducing its performance. To address this problem, we propose the Noise-aware Contrastive Learning for CIR (NCL-CIR), comprising two key components: the Weight Compensation Block (WCB) and the Noise-pair Filter Block (NFB). The WCB coupled with diverse weight maps can ensure more stable token representations of multi-modal queries and target images. Meanwhile, the NFB, in conjunction with the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) predicts noise pairs by evaluating loss distributions, and generates soft labels correspondingly, allowing for the design of the soft-label based Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) loss function. Consequently, the overall architecture helps to mitigate the influence of mismatched and partially matched samples, with experimental results demonstrating that NCL-CIR achieves exceptional performance on the benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>AnomalyHybrid: A Domain-agnostic Generative Framework for General Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly generation is an effective way to mitigate data scarcity for anomaly detection task. Most existing works shine at industrial anomaly generation with multiple specialists or large generative models, rarely generalizing to anomalies in other applications. In this paper, we present AnomalyHybrid, a domain-agnostic framework designed to generate authentic and diverse anomalies simply by combining the reference and target images. AnomalyHybrid is a Generative Adversarial Network(GAN)-based framework having two decoders that integrate the appearance of reference image into the depth and edge structures of target image respectively. With the help of depth decoders, AnomalyHybrid achieves authentic generation especially for the anomalies with depth values changing, such a s protrusion and dent. More, it relaxes the fine granularity structural control of the edge decoder and brings more diversity. Without using annotations, AnomalyHybrid is easily trained with sets of color, depth and edge of same images having different augmentations. Extensive experiments carried on HeliconiusButterfly, MVTecAD and MVTec3D datasets demonstrate that AnomalyHybrid surpasses the GAN-based state-of-the-art on anomaly generation and its downstream anomaly classification, detection and segmentation tasks. On MVTecAD dataset, AnomalyHybrid achieves 2.06/0.32 IS/LPIPS for anomaly generation, 52.6 Acc for anomaly classification with ResNet34, 97.3/72.9 AP for image/pixel-level anomaly detection with a simple UNet.</description>

      <title>OmniDrive: A Holistic Vision-Language Dataset for Autonomous Driving with Counterfactual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have led to a growing interest in autonomous driving to leverage their strong reasoning capabilities. However, extending these capabilities from 2D to full 3D understanding is crucial for real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose OmniDrive, a holistic vision-language dataset that aligns agent models with 3D driving tasks through counterfactual reasoning. This approach enhances decision-making by evaluating potential scenarios and their outcomes, similar to human drivers considering alternative actions. Our counterfactual-based synthetic data annotation process generates large-scale, high-quality datasets, providing denser supervision signals that bridge planning trajectories and language-based reasoning. Futher, we explore two advanced OmniDrive-Agent frameworks, namely Omni-L and Omni-Q, to assess the importance of vision-language alignment versus 3D perception, revealing critical insights into designing effective LLM-agents. Significant improvements on the DriveLM Q\&amp;A benchmark and nuScenes open-loop planning demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and methods.</description>

      <title>UniToken: Harmonizing Multimodal Understanding and Generation through Unified Visual Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce UniToken, an auto-regressive generation model that encodes visual inputs through a combination of discrete and continuous representations, enabling seamless integration of unified visual understanding and image generation tasks. Unlike previous approaches that rely on unilateral visual representations, our unified visual encoding framework captures both high-level semantics and low-level details, delivering multidimensional information that empowers heterogeneous tasks to selectively assimilate domain-specific knowledge based on their inherent characteristics. Through in-depth experiments, we uncover key principles for developing a unified model capable of both visual understanding and image generation. Extensive evaluations across a diverse range of prominent benchmarks demonstrate that UniToken achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches. These results establish UniToken as a robust foundation for future research in this domain. The code and models are available at https://github.com/SxJyJay/UniToken.</description>

      <title>FluentLip: A Phonemes-Based Two-stage Approach for Audio-Driven Lip Synthesis with Optical Flow Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating consecutive images of lip movements that align with a given speech in audio-driven lip synthesis is a challenging task. While previous studies have made strides in synchronization and visual quality, lip intelligibility and video fluency remain persistent challenges. This work proposes FluentLip, a two-stage approach for audio-driven lip synthesis, incorporating three featured strategies. To improve lip synchronization and intelligibility, we integrate a phoneme extractor and encoder to generate a fusion of audio and phoneme information for multimodal learning. Additionally, we employ optical flow consistency loss to ensure natural transitions between image frames. Furthermore, we incorporate a diffusion chain during the training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve both stability and efficiency. We evaluate our proposed FluentLip through extensive experiments, comparing it with five state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across five metrics, including a proposed metric called Phoneme Error Rate (PER) that evaluates lip pose intelligibility and video fluency. The experimental results demonstrate that our FluentLip approach is highly competitive, achieving significant improvements in smoothness and naturalness. In particular, it outperforms these SOTA approaches by approximately $\textbf{16.3%}$ in Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and $\textbf{35.2%}$ in PER.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation framework for image segmentation algorithms, encompassing naive methods, machine learning approaches, and deep learning techniques. We begin by introducing the fundamental concepts and importance of image segmentation, and the role of interactive segmentation in enhancing accuracy. A detailed background theory section explores various segmentation methods, including thresholding, edge detection, region growing, feature extraction, random forests, support vector machines, convolutional neural networks, U-Net, and Mask R-CNN. The implementation and experimental setup are thoroughly described, highlighting three primary approaches: algorithm assisting user, user assisting algorithm, and hybrid methods. Evaluation metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU), computation time, and user interaction time are employed to measure performance. A comparative analysis presents detailed results, emphasizing the strengths, limitations, and trade-offs of each method. The paper concludes with insights into the practical applicability of these approaches across various scenarios and outlines future work, focusing on expanding datasets, developing more representative approaches, integrating real-time feedback, and exploring weakly supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms to enhance segmentation accuracy and efficiency.

      <title>Thermoxels: a voxel-based method to generate simulation-ready 3D thermal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the European Union, buildings account for 42% of energy use and 35% of greenhouse gas emissions. Since most existing buildings will still be in use by 2050, retrofitting is crucial for emissions reduction. However, current building assessment methods rely mainly on qualitative thermal imaging, which limits data-driven decisions for energy savings. On the other hand, quantitative assessments using finite element analysis (FEA) offer precise insights but require manual CAD design, which is tedious and error-prone. Recent advances in 3D reconstruction, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting, enable precise 3D modeling from sparse images but lack clearly defined volumes and the interfaces between them needed for FEA. We propose Thermoxels, a novel voxel-based method able to generate FEA-compatible models, including both geometry and temperature, from a sparse set of RGB and thermal images. Using pairs of RGB and thermal images as input, Thermoxels represents a scene's geometry as a set of voxels comprising color and temperature information. After optimization, a simple process is used to transform Thermoxels' models into tetrahedral meshes compatible with FEA. We demonstrate Thermoxels' capability to generate RGB+Thermal meshes of 3D scenes, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods. To showcase the practical applications of Thermoxels' models, we conduct a simple heat conduction simulation using FEA, achieving convergence from an initial state defined by Thermoxels' thermal reconstruction. Additionally, we compare Thermoxels' image synthesis abilities with current state-of-the-art methods, showing competitive results, and discuss the limitations of existing metrics in assessing mesh quality.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Probabilistic Representation for Integrated Shape Modeling and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the advancements in 3D full-shape generation, accurately modeling complex geometries and semantics of shape parts remains a significant challenge, particularly for shapes with varying numbers of parts. Current methods struggle to effectively integrate the contextual and structural information of 3D shapes into their generative processes. We address these limitations with PRISM, a novel compositional approach for 3D shape generation that integrates categorical diffusion models with Statistical Shape Models (SSM) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). Our method employs compositional SSMs to capture part-level geometric variations and uses GMM to represent part semantics in a continuous space. This integration enables both high fidelity and diversity in generated shapes while preserving structural coherence. Through extensive experiments on shape generation and manipulation tasks, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous methods in both quality and controllability of part-level operations. Our code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) research faces significant challenges due to fragmented toolchains, complex system configurations, and inconsistent evaluation methodologies. To address these issues, we present VSLAM-LAB, a unified framework designed to streamline the development, evaluation, and deployment of VSLAM systems. VSLAM-LAB simplifies the entire workflow by enabling seamless compilation and configuration of VSLAM algorithms, automated dataset downloading and preprocessing, and standardized experiment design, execution, and evaluation--all accessible through a single command-line interface. The framework supports a wide range of VSLAM systems and datasets, offering broad compatibility and extendability while promoting reproducibility through consistent evaluation metrics and analysis tools. By reducing implementation complexity and minimizing configuration overhead, VSLAM-LAB empowers researchers to focus on advancing VSLAM methodologies and accelerates progress toward scalable, real-world solutions. We demonstrate the ease with which user-relevant benchmarks can be created: here, we introduce difficulty-level-based categories, but one could envision environment-specific or condition-specific categories.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Geometry Enhanced 3D Dynamic Snake Convolutional Neural Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image classification, including complex and sparse ground object distributions, small clustered structures, and elongated multi-branch features that often lead to missing detections. To better adapt to ground object distributions and achieve adaptive dynamic feature responses while skipping redundant information, this paper proposes a Spatial-Geometry Enhanced 3D Dynamic Snake Network (SG-DSCNet) based on an improved 3D-DenseNet model. The network employs Dynamic Snake Convolution (DSCConv), which introduces deformable offsets to enhance kernel flexibility through constrained self-learning, thereby improving regional perception of ground objects. Additionally, we propose a multi-view feature fusion strategy that generates multiple morphological kernel templates from DSCConv to observe target structures from different perspectives and achieve efficient feature fusion through summarizing key characteristics. This dynamic approach enables the model to focus more flexibly on critical spatial structures when processing different regions, rather than relying on fixed receptive fields of single static kernels. The DSC module enhances model representation capability through dynamic kernel aggregation without increasing network depth or width. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance on the IN, UP, and KSC datasets, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral classification methods.</description>

      <title>Domain Generalization for Face Anti-spoofing via Content-aware Composite Prompt Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of Domain Generalization (DG) in Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is the significant interference of domain-specific signals on subtle spoofing clues. Recently, some CLIP-based algorithms have been developed to alleviate this interference by adjusting the weights of visual classifiers. However, our analysis of this class-wise prompt engineering suffers from two shortcomings for DG FAS: (1) The categories of facial categories, such as real or spoof, have no semantics for the CLIP model, making it difficult to learn accurate category descriptions. (2) A single form of prompt cannot portray the various types of spoofing. In this work, instead of class-wise prompts, we propose a novel Content-aware Composite Prompt Engineering (CCPE) that generates instance-wise composite prompts, including both fixed template and learnable prompts. Specifically, our CCPE constructs content-aware prompts from two branches: (1) Inherent content prompt explicitly benefits from abundant transferred knowledge from the instruction-based Large Language Model (LLM). (2) Learnable content prompts implicitly extract the most informative visual content via Q-Former. Moreover, we design a Cross-Modal Guidance Module (CGM) that dynamically adjusts unimodal features for fusion to achieve better generalized FAS. Finally, our CCPE has been validated for its effectiveness in multiple cross-domain experiments and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.</description>

      <title>VideoAgent2: Enhancing the LLM-Based Agent System for Long-Form Video Understanding by Uncertainty-Aware CoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long video understanding has emerged as an increasingly important yet challenging task in computer vision. Agent-based approaches are gaining popularity for processing long videos, as they can handle extended sequences and integrate various tools to capture fine-grained information. However, existing methods still face several challenges: (1) they often rely solely on the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) without dedicated mechanisms to enhance reasoning in long video scenarios; and (2) they remain vulnerable to errors or noise from external tools. To address these issues, we propose a specialized chain-of-thought (CoT) process tailored for long video analysis. Our proposed CoT with plan-adjust mode enables the LLM to incrementally plan and adapt its information-gathering strategy. We further incorporate heuristic uncertainty estimation of both the LLM and external tools to guide the CoT process. This allows the LLM to assess the reliability of newly collected information, refine its collection strategy, and make more robust decisions when synthesizing final answers. Empirical experiments show that our uncertainty-aware CoT effectively mitigates noise from external tools, leading to more reliable outputs. We implement our approach in a system called VideoAgent2, which also includes additional modules such as general context acquisition and specialized tool design. Evaluation on three dedicated long video benchmarks (and their subsets) demonstrates that VideoAgent2 outperforms the previous state-of-the-art agent-based method, VideoAgent, by an average of 13.1% and achieves leading performance among all zero-shot approaches</description>

      <title>Statistical Guarantees Of False Discovery Rate In Medical Instance Segmentation Tasks Based on Conformal Risk Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instance segmentation plays a pivotal role in medical image analysis by enabling precise localization and delineation of lesions, tumors, and anatomical structures. Although deep learning models such as Mask R-CNN and BlendMask have achieved remarkable progress, their application in high-risk medical scenarios remains constrained by confidence calibration issues, which may lead to misdiagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose a robust quality control framework based on conformal prediction theory. This framework innovatively constructs a risk-aware dynamic threshold mechanism that adaptively adjusts segmentation decision boundaries according to clinical requirements.Specifically, we design a \textbf{calibration-aware loss function} that dynamically tunes the segmentation threshold based on a user-defined risk level $\alpha$. Utilizing exchangeable calibration data, this method ensures that the expected FNR or FDR on test data remains below $\alpha$ with high probability. The framework maintains compatibility with mainstream segmentation models (e.g., Mask R-CNN, BlendMask+ResNet-50-FPN) and datasets (PASCAL VOC format) without requiring architectural modifications. Empirical results demonstrate that we rigorously bound the FDR metric marginally over the test set via our developed calibration framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-driven autonomous agents have emerged as a promising direction in recent years. However, many of these LLM agents are designed empirically or based on intuition, often lacking systematic design principles, which results in diverse agent structures with limited generality and scalability. In this paper, we advocate for building LLM agents by incorporating insights from computer systems. Inspired by the von Neumann architecture, we propose a structured framework for LLM agentic systems, emphasizing modular design and universal principles. Specifically, this paper first provides a comprehensive review of LLM agents from the computer system perspective, then identifies key challenges and future directions inspired by computer system design, and finally explores the learning mechanisms for LLM agents beyond the computer system. The insights gained from this comparative analysis offer a foundation for systematic LLM agent design and advancement.</description>

      <title>Learning Conditionally Independent Transformations using Normal Subgroups in Group Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans develop certain cognitive abilities to recognize objects and their transformations without explicit supervision, highlighting the importance of unsupervised representation learning. A fundamental challenge in unsupervised representation learning is to separate different transformations in learned feature representations. Although algebraic approaches have been explored, a comprehensive theoretical framework remains underdeveloped. Existing methods decompose transformations based on algebraic independence, but these methods primarily focus on commutative transformations and do not extend to cases where transformations are conditionally independent but noncommutative. To extend current representation learning frameworks, we draw inspiration from Galois theory, where the decomposition of groups through normal subgroups provides an approach for the analysis of structured transformations. Normal subgroups naturally extend commutativity under certain conditions and offer a foundation for the categorization of transformations, even when they do not commute. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages normal subgroups to enable the separation of conditionally independent transformations, even in the absence of commutativity. Through experiments on geometric transformations in images, we show that our method successfully categorizes conditionally independent transformations, such as rotation and translation, in an unsupervised manner, suggesting a close link between group decomposition via normal subgroups and transformation categorization in representation learning.</description>

      <title>Skin Color Measurement from Dermatoscopic Images: An Evaluation on a Synthetic Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of skin color measurement methods from dermatoscopic images using a synthetic dataset (S-SYNTH) with controlled ground-truth melanin content, lesion shapes, hair models, and 18 distinct lighting conditions. This allows for rigorous assessment of the robustness and invariance to lighting conditions. We assess four classes of image colorimetry approaches: segmentation-based, patch-based, color quantization, and neural networks. We use these methods to estimate the Individual Typology Angle (ITA) and Fitzpatrick types from dermatoscopic images. Our results show that segmentation-based and color quantization methods yield robust, lighting-invariant estimates, whereas patch-based approaches exhibit significant lighting-dependent biases that require calibration. Furthermore, neural network models, particularly when combined with heavy blurring to reduce overfitting, can provide light-invariant Fitzpatrick predictions, although their generalization to real-world images remains unverified. We conclude with practical recommendations for designing fair and reliable skin color estimation methods.</description>

      <title>AVadCLIP: Audio-Visual Collaboration for Robust Video Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing adoption of video anomaly detection in intelligent surveillance domains, conventional visual-based detection approaches often struggle with information insufficiency and high false-positive rates in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present a novel weakly supervised framework that leverages audio-visual collaboration for robust video anomaly detection. Capitalizing on the exceptional cross-modal representation learning capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) across visual, audio, and textual domains, our framework introduces two major innovations: an efficient audio-visual fusion that enables adaptive cross-modal integration through lightweight parametric adaptation while maintaining the frozen CLIP backbone, and a novel audio-visual prompt that dynamically enhances text embeddings with key multimodal information based on the semantic correlation between audio-visual features and textual labels, significantly improving CLIP's generalization for the video anomaly detection task. Moreover, to enhance robustness against modality deficiency during inference, we further develop an uncertainty-driven feature distillation module that synthesizes audio-visual representations from visual-only inputs. This module employs uncertainty modeling based on the diversity of audio-visual features to dynamically emphasize challenging features during the distillation process. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, with audio integration significantly boosting anomaly detection accuracy in various scenarios. Notably, with unimodal data enhanced by uncertainty-driven distillation, our approach consistently outperforms current unimodal VAD methods.</description>

      <title>Attributed Synthetic Data Generation for Zero-shot Domain-specific Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot domain-specific image classification is challenging in classifying real images without ground-truth in-domain training examples. Recent research involved knowledge from texts with a text-to-image model to generate in-domain training images in zero-shot scenarios. However, existing methods heavily rely on simple prompt strategies, limiting the diversity of synthetic training images, thus leading to inferior performance compared to real images. In this paper, we propose AttrSyn, which leverages large language models to generate attributed prompts. These prompts allow for the generation of more diverse attributed synthetic images. Experiments for zero-shot domain-specific image classification on two fine-grained datasets show that training with synthetic images generated by AttrSyn significantly outperforms CLIP's zero-shot classification under most situations and consistently surpasses simple prompt strategies.</description>

      <title>Enhance Then Search: An Augmentation-Search Strategy with Foundation Models for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on extensive datasets, such as GroundingDINO and LAE-DINO, have performed remarkably in the cross-domain few-shot object detection (CD-FSOD) task. Through rigorous few-shot training, we found that the integration of image-based data augmentation techniques and grid-based sub-domain search strategy significantly enhances the performance of these foundation models. Building upon GroundingDINO, we employed several widely used image augmentation methods and established optimization objectives to effectively navigate the expansive domain space in search of optimal sub-domains. This approach facilitates efficient few-shot object detection and introduces an approach to solving the CD-FSOD problem by efficiently searching for the optimal parameter configuration from the foundation model. Our findings substantially advance the practical deployment of vision-language models in data-scarce environments, offering critical insights into optimizing their cross-domain generalization capabilities without labor-intensive retraining.

      <title>SAM2MOT: A Novel Paradigm of Multi-Object Tracking by Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segment Anything 2 (SAM2) enables robust single-object tracking using segmentation. To extend this to multi-object tracking (MOT), we propose SAM2MOT, introducing a novel Tracking by Segmentation paradigm. Unlike Tracking by Detection or Tracking by Query, SAM2MOT directly generates tracking boxes from segmentation masks, reducing reliance on detection accuracy. SAM2MOT has two key advantages: zero-shot generalization, allowing it to work across datasets without fine-tuning, and strong object association, inherited from SAM2. To further improve performance, we integrate a trajectory manager system for precise object addition and removal, and a cross-object interaction module to handle occlusions. Experiments on DanceTrack, UAVDT, and BDD100K show state-of-the-art results. Notably, SAM2MOT outperforms existing methods on DanceTrack by +2.1 HOTA and +4.5 IDF1, highlighting its effectiveness in MOT.</description>

      <title>SnapPix: Efficient-Coding--Inspired In-Sensor Compression for Edge Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-efficient image acquisition on the edge is crucial for enabling remote sensing applications where the sensor node has weak compute capabilities and must transmit data to a remote server/cloud for processing. To reduce the edge energy consumption, this paper proposes a sensor-algorithm co-designed system called SnapPix, which compresses raw pixels in the analog domain inside the sensor. We use coded exposure (CE) as the in-sensor compression strategy as it offers the flexibility to sample, i.e., selectively expose pixels, both spatially and temporally. SNAPPIX has three contributions. First, we propose a task-agnostic strategy to learn the sampling/exposure pattern based on the classic theory of efficient coding. Second, we co-design the downstream vision model with the exposure pattern to address the pixel-level non-uniformity unique to CE-compressed images. Finally, we propose lightweight augmentations to the image sensor hardware to support our in-sensor CE compression. Evaluating on action recognition and video reconstruction, SnapPix outperforms state-of-the-art video-based methods at the same speed while reducing the energy by up to 15.4x. We have open-sourced the code at: https://github.com/horizon-research/SnapPix.</description>

      <title>The Point, the Vision and the Text: Does Point Cloud Boost Spatial Reasoning of Large Language Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) leveraging spatial information in point clouds for 3D spatial reasoning attract great attention. Despite some promising results, the role of point clouds in 3D spatial reasoning remains under-explored. In this work, we comprehensively evaluate and analyze these models to answer the research question: \textit{Does point cloud truly boost the spatial reasoning capacities of 3D LLMs?} We first evaluate the spatial reasoning capacity of LLMs with different input modalities by replacing the point cloud with the visual and text counterparts. We then propose a novel 3D QA (Question-answering) benchmark, ScanReQA, that comprehensively evaluates models' understanding of binary spatial relationships. Our findings reveal several critical insights: 1) LLMs without point input could even achieve competitive performance even in a zero-shot manner; 2) existing 3D LLMs struggle to comprehend the binary spatial relationships; 3) 3D LLMs exhibit limitations in exploiting the structural coordinates in point clouds for fine-grained spatial reasoning. We think these conclusions can help the next step of 3D LLMs and also offer insights for foundation models in other modalities. We release datasets and reproducible codes in the anonymous project page: https://3d-llm.xyz.</description>

      <title>Opening the black box of deep learning: Validating the statistical association between explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and clinical domain knowledge in fundus image-based glaucoma diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deep learning has exhibited remarkable predictive capabilities in various medical image tasks, its inherent black-box nature has hindered its widespread implementation in real-world healthcare settings. Our objective is to unveil the decision-making processes of deep learning models in the context of glaucoma classification by employing several Class Activation Map (CAM) techniques to generate model focus regions and comparing them with clinical domain knowledge of the anatomical area (optic cup, optic disk, and blood vessels). Four deep neural networks, including VGG-11, ResNet-18, DeiT-Tiny, and Swin Transformer-Tiny, were developed using binary diagnostic labels of glaucoma and five CAM methods (Grad-CAM, XGrad-CAM, Score-CAM, Eigen-CAM, and Layer-CAM) were employed to highlight the model focus area. We applied the paired-sample t-test to compare the percentage of anatomies in the model focus area to the proportion of anatomies in the entire image. After that, Pearson's and Spearman's correlation tests were implemented to examine the relationship between model predictive ability and the percentage of anatomical structures in the model focus area. On five public glaucoma datasets, all deep learning models consistently displayed statistically significantly higher percentages of anatomical structures in the focus area than the proportions of anatomical structures in the entire image. Also, we validated the positive relationship between the percentage of anatomical structures in the focus area and model predictive performance. Our study provides evidence of the convergence of decision logic between deep neural networks and human clinicians through rigorous statistical tests. We anticipate that it can help alleviate clinicians' concerns regarding the trustworthiness of deep learning in healthcare. For reproducibility, the code and dataset have been released at GitHub.</description>

      <title>Advancing Egocentric Video Question Answering with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (QA) requires models to handle long-horizon temporal reasoning, first-person perspectives, and specialized challenges like frequent camera movement. This paper systematically evaluates both proprietary and open-source Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on QaEgo4Dv2 - a refined dataset of egocentric videos derived from QaEgo4D. Four popular MLLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Video-LLaVa-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct) are assessed using zero-shot and fine-tuned approaches for both OpenQA and CloseQA settings. We introduce QaEgo4Dv2 to mitigate annotation noise in QaEgo4D, enabling more reliable comparison. Our results show that fine-tuned Video-LLaVa-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct achieve new state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous benchmarks by up to +2.6% ROUGE/METEOR (for OpenQA) and +13% accuracy (for CloseQA). We also present a thorough error analysis, indicating the model's difficulty in spatial reasoning and fine-grained object recognition - key areas for future improvement.</description>

      <title>DyCON: Dynamic Uncertainty-aware Consistency and Contrastive Learning for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning in medical image segmentation leverages unlabeled data to reduce annotation burdens through consistency learning. However, current methods struggle with class imbalance and high uncertainty from pathology variations, leading to inaccurate segmentation in 3D medical images. To address these challenges, we present DyCON, a Dynamic Uncertainty-aware Consistency and Contrastive Learning framework that enhances the generalization of consistency methods with two complementary losses: Uncertainty-aware Consistency Loss (UnCL) and Focal Entropy-aware Contrastive Loss (FeCL). UnCL enforces global consistency by dynamically weighting the contribution of each voxel to the consistency loss based on its uncertainty, preserving high-uncertainty regions instead of filtering them out. Initially, UnCL prioritizes learning from uncertain voxels with lower penalties, encouraging the model to explore challenging regions. As training progress, the penalty shift towards confident voxels to refine predictions and ensure global consistency. Meanwhile, FeCL enhances local feature discrimination in imbalanced regions by introducing dual focal mechanisms and adaptive confidence adjustments into the contrastive principle. These mechanisms jointly prioritizes hard positives and negatives while focusing on uncertain sample pairs, effectively capturing subtle lesion variations under class imbalance. Extensive evaluations on four diverse medical image segmentation datasets (ISLES'22, BraTS'19, LA, Pancreas) show DyCON's superior performance against SOTA methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise video retrieval requires multi-modal correlations to handle unseen vocabulary and scenes, becoming more complex for lengthy videos where models must perform effectively without prior training on a specific dataset. We introduce a unified framework that combines a visual matching stream and an aural matching stream with a unique subtitles-based video segmentation approach. Additionally, the aural stream includes a complementary audio-based two-stage retrieval mechanism that enhances performance on long-duration videos. Considering the complex nature of retrieval from lengthy videos and its corresponding evaluation, we introduce a new retrieval evaluation method specifically designed for long-video retrieval to support further research. We conducted experiments on the YouCook2 benchmark, showing promising retrieval performance.</description>

      <title>Your Image Generator Is Your New Private Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools to synthetically produce training data, offering potential solutions to data scarcity and reducing labelling costs for downstream supervised deep learning applications. However, effectively leveraging text-conditioned image generation for building classifier training sets requires addressing key issues: constructing informative textual prompts, adapting generative models to specific domains, and ensuring robust performance. This paper proposes the Text-Conditioned Knowledge Recycling (TCKR) pipeline to tackle these challenges. TCKR combines dynamic image captioning, parameter-efficient diffusion model fine-tuning, and Generative Knowledge Distillation techniques to create synthetic datasets tailored for image classification. The pipeline is rigorously evaluated on ten diverse image classification benchmarks. The results demonstrate that models trained solely on TCKR-generated data achieve classification accuracies on par with (and in several cases exceeding) models trained on real images. Furthermore, the evaluation reveals that these synthetic-data-trained models exhibit substantially enhanced privacy characteristics: their vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks is significantly reduced, with the membership inference AUC lowered by 5.49 points on average compared to using real training data, demonstrating a substantial improvement in the performance-privacy trade-off. These findings indicate that high-fidelity synthetic data can effectively replace real data for training classifiers, yielding strong performance whilst simultaneously providing improved privacy protection as a valuable emergent property. The code and trained models are available in the accompanying open-source repository.</description>

      <title>Targetless LiDAR-Camera Calibration with Anchored 3D Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method that jointly optimizes sensor poses and scene geometry from arbitrary scenes, without relying on traditional calibration targets such as checkerboards or spherical reflectors. Our approach leverages a 3D Gaussian-based scene representation. We first freeze reliable LiDAR points as anchors, then jointly optimize the poses and auxiliary Gaussian parameters in a fully differentiable manner using a photometric loss. This joint optimization significantly reduces sensor misalignment, resulting in higher rendering quality and consistently improved PSNR compared to the carefully calibrated poses provided in popular datasets. We validate our method through extensive experiments on two real-world autonomous driving datasets, KITTI-360 and Waymo, each featuring distinct sensor configurations. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach using a custom LiDAR-camera setup, confirming strong performance across diverse hardware configurations.</description>

      <title>Systematic Literature Review on Vehicular Collaborative Perception -- A Computer Vision Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effectiveness of autonomous vehicles relies on reliable perception capabilities. Despite significant advancements in artificial intelligence and sensor fusion technologies, current single-vehicle perception systems continue to encounter limitations, notably visual occlusions and limited long-range detection capabilities. Collaborative Perception (CP), enabled by Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication, has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate these issues and enhance the reliability of autonomous systems. Beyond advancements in communication, the computer vision community is increasingly focusing on improving vehicular perception through collaborative approaches. However, a systematic literature review that thoroughly examines existing work and reduces subjective bias is still lacking. Such a systematic approach helps identify research gaps, recognize common trends across studies, and inform future research directions. In response, this study follows the PRISMA 2020 guidelines and includes 106 peer-reviewed articles. These publications are analyzed based on modalities, collaboration schemes, and key perception tasks. Through a comparative analysis, this review illustrates how different methods address practical issues such as pose errors, temporal latency, communication constraints, domain shifts, heterogeneity, and adversarial attacks.

      <title>M2IV: Towards Efficient and Fine-grained Multimodal In-Context Learning in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) is a vital capability for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), allowing task adaptation via contextual prompts without parameter retraining. However, its application is hindered by the token-intensive nature of inputs and the high complexity of cross-modal few-shot learning, which limits the expressive power of representation methods. To tackle these challenges, we propose \textbf{M2IV}, a method that substitutes explicit demonstrations with learnable \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{V}ectors directly integrated into LVLMs. By exploiting the complementary strengths of multi-head attention (\textbf{M}HA) and multi-layer perceptrons (\textbf{M}LP), M2IV achieves robust cross-modal fidelity and fine-grained semantic distillation through training. This significantly enhances performance across diverse LVLMs and tasks and scales efficiently to many-shot scenarios, bypassing the context window limitations. We also introduce \textbf{VLibrary}, a repository for storing and retrieving M2IV, enabling flexible LVLM steering for tasks like cross-modal alignment, customized generation and safety improvement. Experiments across seven benchmarks and three LVLMs show that M2IV surpasses Vanilla ICL and prior representation engineering approaches, with an average accuracy gain of \textbf{3.74\%} over ICL with the same shot count, alongside substantial efficiency advantages.</description>

      <title>LEO-MINI: An Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model using Conditional Token Reduction and Mixture of Multi-Modal Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Redundancy of visual tokens in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) significantly reduces their computational efficiency. Recent approaches, such as resamplers and summarizers, have sought to reduce the number of visual tokens, but at the cost of visual reasoning ability. To address this, we propose LEO-MINI, a novel MLLM that significantly reduces the number of visual tokens and simultaneously boosts visual reasoning capabilities. For efficiency, LEO-MINI incorporates CoTR, a novel token reduction module to consolidate a large number of visual tokens into a smaller set of tokens, using the similarity between visual tokens, text tokens, and a compact learnable query. For effectiveness, to scale up the model's ability with minimal computational overhead, LEO-MINI employs MMoE, a novel mixture of multi-modal experts module. MMOE employs a set of LoRA experts with a novel router to switch between them based on the input text and visual tokens instead of only using the input hidden state. MMoE also includes a general LoRA expert that is always activated to learn general knowledge for LLM reasoning. For extracting richer visual features, MMOE employs a set of vision experts trained on diverse domain-specific data. To demonstrate LEO-MINI's improved efficiency and performance, we evaluate it against existing efficient MLLMs on various benchmark vision-language tasks.</description>

      <title>3DM-WeConvene: Learned Image Compression with 3D Multi-Level Wavelet-Domain Convolution and Entropy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has recently made significant progress, surpassing traditional methods. However, most LIC approaches operate mainly in the spatial domain and lack mechanisms for reducing frequency-domain correlations. To address this, we propose a novel framework that integrates low-complexity 3D multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) into convolutional layers and entropy coding, reducing both spatial and channel correlations to improve frequency selectivity and rate-distortion (R-D) performance.
  Our proposed 3D multi-level wavelet-domain convolution (3DM-WeConv) layer first applies 3D multi-level DWT (e.g., 5/3 and 9/7 wavelets from JPEG 2000) to transform data into the wavelet domain. Then, different-sized convolutions are applied to different frequency subbands, followed by inverse 3D DWT to restore the spatial domain. The 3DM-WeConv layer can be flexibly used within existing CNN-based LIC models.
  We also introduce a 3D wavelet-domain channel-wise autoregressive entropy model (3DWeChARM), which performs slice-based entropy coding in the 3D DWT domain. Low-frequency (LF) slices are encoded first to provide priors for high-frequency (HF) slices.
  A two-step training strategy is adopted: first balancing LF and HF rates, then fine-tuning with separate weights.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-based LIC methods in R-D performance and computational complexity, with larger gains for high-resolution images. On the Kodak, Tecnick 100, and CLIC test sets, our method achieves BD-Rate reductions of -12.24%, -15.51%, and -12.97%, respectively, compared to H.266/VVC.</description>

      <title>Dual Consistent Constraint via Disentangled Consistency and Complementarity for Multi-view Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-view clustering can explore common semantics from multiple views and has received increasing attention in recent years. However, current methods focus on learning consistency in representation, neglecting the contribution of each view's complementarity aspect in representation learning. This limit poses a significant challenge in multi-view representation learning. This paper proposes a novel multi-view clustering framework that introduces a disentangled variational autoencoder that separates multi-view into shared and private information, i.e., consistency and complementarity information. We first learn informative and consistent representations by maximizing mutual information across different views through contrastive learning. This process will ignore complementary information. Then, we employ consistency inference constraints to explicitly utilize complementary information when attempting to seek the consistency of shared information across all views. Specifically, we perform a within-reconstruction using the private and shared information of each view and a cross-reconstruction using the shared information of all views. The dual consistency constraints are not only effective in improving the representation quality of data but also easy to extend to other scenarios, especially in complex multi-view scenes. This could be the first attempt to employ dual consistent constraint in a unified MVC theoretical framework. During the training procedure, the consistency and complementarity features are jointly optimized. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms baseline methods.</description>

      <title>DeclutterNeRF: Generative-Free 3D Scene Recovery for Occlusion Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent novel view synthesis (NVS) techniques, including Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly advanced 3D scene reconstruction with high-quality rendering and realistic detail recovery. Effectively removing occlusions while preserving scene details can further enhance the robustness and applicability of these techniques. However, existing approaches for object and occlusion removal predominantly rely on generative priors, which, despite filling the resulting holes, introduce new artifacts and blurriness. Moreover, existing benchmark datasets for evaluating occlusion removal methods lack realistic complexity and viewpoint variations. To address these issues, we introduce DeclutterSet, a novel dataset featuring diverse scenes with pronounced occlusions distributed across foreground, midground, and background, exhibiting substantial relative motion across viewpoints. We further introduce DeclutterNeRF, an occlusion removal method free from generative priors. DeclutterNeRF introduces joint multi-view optimization of learnable camera parameters, occlusion annealing regularization, and employs an explainable stochastic structural similarity loss, ensuring high-quality, artifact-free reconstructions from incomplete images. Experiments demonstrate that DeclutterNeRF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on our proposed DeclutterSet, establishing a strong baseline for future research.</description>

      <title>Bridging Knowledge Gap Between Image Inpainting and Large-Area Visible Watermark Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visible watermark removal which involves watermark cleaning and background content restoration is pivotal to evaluate the resilience of watermarks. Existing deep neural network (DNN)-based models still struggle with large-area watermarks and are overly dependent on the quality of watermark mask prediction. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel feature adapting framework that leverages the representation modeling capacity of a pre-trained image inpainting model. Our approach bridges the knowledge gap between image inpainting and watermark removal by fusing information of the residual background content beneath watermarks into the inpainting backbone model. We establish a dual-branch system to capture and embed features from the residual background content, which are merged into intermediate features of the inpainting backbone model via gated feature fusion modules. Moreover, for relieving the dependence on high-quality watermark masks, we introduce a new training paradigm by utilizing coarse watermark masks to guide the inference process. This contributes to a visible image removal model which is insensitive to the quality of watermark mask during testing. Extensive experiments on both a large-scale synthesized dataset and a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>DFormerv2: Geometry Self-Attention for RGBD Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in scene understanding benefit a lot from depth maps because of the 3D geometry information, especially in complex conditions (e.g., low light and overexposed). Existing approaches encode depth maps along with RGB images and perform feature fusion between them to enable more robust predictions. Taking into account that depth can be regarded as a geometry supplement for RGB images, a straightforward question arises: Do we really need to explicitly encode depth information with neural networks as done for RGB images? Based on this insight, in this paper, we investigate a new way to learn RGBD feature representations and present DFormerv2, a strong RGBD encoder that explicitly uses depth maps as geometry priors rather than encoding depth information with neural networks. Our goal is to extract the geometry clues from the depth and spatial distances among all the image patch tokens, which will then be used as geometry priors to allocate attention weights in self-attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFormerv2 exhibits exceptional performance in various RGBD semantic segmentation benchmarks.

      <title>SapiensID: Foundation for Human Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing human recognition systems often rely on separate, specialized models for face and body analysis, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios where pose, visibility, and context vary widely. This paper introduces SapiensID, a unified model that bridges this gap, achieving robust performance across diverse settings. SapiensID introduces (i) Retina Patch (RP), a dynamic patch generation scheme that adapts to subject scale and ensures consistent tokenization of regions of interest, (ii) a masked recognition model (MRM) that learns from variable token length, and (iii) Semantic Attention Head (SAH), an module that learns pose-invariant representations by pooling features around key body parts. To facilitate training, we introduce WebBody4M, a large-scale dataset capturing diverse poses and scale variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SapiensID achieves state-of-the-art results on various body ReID benchmarks, outperforming specialized models in both short-term and long-term scenarios while remaining competitive with dedicated face recognition systems. Furthermore, SapiensID establishes a strong baseline for the newly introduced challenge of Cross Pose-Scale ReID, demonstrating its ability to generalize to complex, real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of GUI Grounding Models Against Image Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding models are crucial for enabling intelligent agents to understand and interact with complex visual interfaces. However, these models face significant robustness challenges in real-world scenarios due to natural noise and adversarial perturbations, and their robustness remains underexplored. In this study, we systematically evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art GUI grounding models, such as UGround, under three conditions: natural noise, untargeted adversarial attacks, and targeted adversarial attacks. Our experiments, which were conducted across a wide range of GUI environments, including mobile, desktop, and web interfaces, have clearly demonstrated that GUI grounding models exhibit a high degree of sensitivity to adversarial perturbations and low-resolution conditions. These findings provide valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of GUI grounding models and establish a strong benchmark for future research aimed at enhancing their robustness in practical applications.

      <title>TactileNet: Bridging the Accessibility Gap with AI-Generated Tactile Graphics for Individuals with Vision Impairment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tactile graphics are essential for providing access to visual information for the 43 million people globally living with vision loss, as estimated by global prevalence data. However, traditional methods for creating these tactile graphics are labor-intensive and struggle to meet demand. We introduce TactileNet, the first comprehensive dataset and AI-driven framework for generating tactile graphics using text-to-image Stable Diffusion (SD) models. By integrating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and DreamBooth, our method fine-tunes SD models to produce high-fidelity, guideline-compliant tactile graphics while reducing computational costs. Evaluations involving tactile experts show that generated graphics achieve 92.86% adherence to tactile standards and 100% alignment with natural images in posture and features. Our framework also demonstrates scalability, generating 32,000 images (7,050 filtered for quality) across 66 classes, with prompt editing enabling customizable outputs (e.g., adding/removing details). Our work empowers designers to focus on refinement, significantly accelerating accessibility efforts. It underscores the transformative potential of AI for social good, offering a scalable solution to bridge the accessibility gap in education and beyond.</description>

      <title>Exploring Kernel Transformations for Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs), which leverage neural networks to represent signals by mapping coordinates to their corresponding attributes, have garnered significant attention. They are extensively utilized for image representation, with pixel coordinates as input and pixel values as output. In contrast to prior works focusing on investigating the effect of the model's inside components (activation function, for instance), this work pioneers the exploration of the effect of kernel transformation of input/output while keeping the model itself unchanged. A byproduct of our findings is a simple yet effective method that combines scale and shift to significantly boost INR with negligible computation overhead. Moreover, we present two perspectives, depth and normalization, to interpret the performance benefits caused by scale and shift transformation. Overall, our work provides a new avenue for future works to understand and improve INR through the lens of kernel transformation.</description>

      <title>Inverse++: Vision-Centric 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction Assisted with 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to forecast detailed geometric and semantic information of the surrounding environment for autonomous vehicles (AVs) using onboard surround-view cameras. Existing methods primarily focus on intricate inner structure module designs to improve model performance, such as efficient feature sampling and aggregation processes or intermediate feature representation formats. In this paper, we explore multitask learning by introducing an additional 3D supervision signal by incorporating an additional 3D object detection auxiliary branch. This extra 3D supervision signal enhances the model's overall performance by strengthening the capability of the intermediate features to capture small dynamic objects in the scene, and these small dynamic objects often include vulnerable road users, i.e. bicycles, motorcycles, and pedestrians, whose detection is crucial for ensuring driving safety in autonomous vehicles. Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes datasets, including challenging rainy and nighttime scenarios, showcase that our approach attains state-of-the-art results, achieving an IoU score of 31.73% and a mIoU score of 20.91% and excels at detecting vulnerable road users (VRU).

      <title>Enhancing Compositional Reasoning in Vision-Language Models with Synthetic Preference Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compositionality, or correctly recognizing scenes as compositions of atomic visual concepts, remains difficult for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Even state of the art MLLMs such as GPT-4o can make mistakes in distinguishing compositions like "dog chasing cat" vs "cat chasing dog". While on Winoground, a benchmark for measuring such reasoning, MLLMs have made significant progress, they are still far from a human's performance. We show that compositional reasoning in these models can be improved by elucidating such concepts via data, where a model is trained to prefer the correct caption for an image over a close but incorrect one. We introduce SCRAMBLe: Synthetic Compositional Reasoning Augmentation of MLLMs with Binary preference Learning, an approach for preference tuning open-weight MLLMs on synthetic preference data generated in a fully automated manner from existing image-caption data. SCRAMBLe holistically improves these MLLMs' compositional reasoning capabilities which we can see through significant improvements across multiple vision language compositionality benchmarks, as well as smaller but significant improvements on general question answering tasks. As a sneak peek, SCRAMBLe tuned Molmo-7B model improves on Winoground from 49.5% to 54.8% (best reported to date), while improving by ~1% on more general visual question answering tasks. Code for SCRAMBLe along with tuned models and our synthetic training dataset is available at https://github.com/samarth4149/SCRAMBLe.</description>

      <title>AnyArtisticGlyph: Multilingual Controllable Artistic Glyph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artistic Glyph Image Generation (AGIG) differs from current creativity-focused generation models by offering finely controllable deterministic generation. It transfers the style of a reference image to a source while preserving its content. Although advanced and promising, current methods may reveal flaws when scrutinizing synthesized image details, often producing blurred or incorrect textures, posing a significant challenge. Hence, we introduce AnyArtisticGlyph, a diffusion-based, multilingual controllable artistic glyph generation model. It includes a font fusion and embedding module, which generates latent features for detailed structure creation, and a vision-text fusion and embedding module that uses the CLIP model to encode references and blends them with transformation caption embeddings for seamless global image generation. Moreover, we incorporate a coarse-grained feature-level loss to enhance generation accuracy. Experiments show that it produces natural, detailed artistic glyph images with state-of-the-art performance. Our project will be open-sourced on https://github.com/jiean001/AnyArtisticGlyph to advance text generation technology.</description>

      <title>Grounding 3D Object Affordance with Language Instructions, Visual Observations and Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grounding 3D object affordance is a task that locates objects in 3D space where they can be manipulated, which links perception and action for embodied intelligence. For example, for an intelligent robot, it is necessary to accurately ground the affordance of an object and grasp it according to human instructions. In this paper, we introduce a novel task that grounds 3D object affordance based on language instructions, visual observations and interactions, which is inspired by cognitive science. We collect an Affordance Grounding dataset with Points, Images and Language instructions (AGPIL) to support the proposed task. In the 3D physical world, due to observation orientation, object rotation, or spatial occlusion, we can only get a partial observation of the object. So this dataset includes affordance estimations of objects from full-view, partial-view, and rotation-view perspectives. To accomplish this task, we propose LMAffordance3D, the first multi-modal, language-guided 3D affordance grounding network, which applies a vision-language model to fuse 2D and 3D spatial features with semantic features. Comprehensive experiments on AGPIL demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method on this task, even in unseen experimental settings.

      <title>Two is Better than One: Efficient Ensemble Defense for Robust and Compact Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based computer vision systems adopt complex and large architectures to improve performance, yet they face challenges in deployment on resource-constrained mobile and edge devices. To address this issue, model compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and matrix factorization have been proposed; however, these compressed models are often highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We introduce the \textbf{Efficient Ensemble Defense (EED)} technique, which diversifies the compression of a single base model based on different pruning importance scores and enhances ensemble diversity to achieve high adversarial robustness and resource efficiency. EED dynamically determines the number of necessary sub-models during the inference stage, minimizing unnecessary computations while maintaining high robustness. On the CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets, EED demonstrated state-of-the-art robustness performance compared to existing adversarial pruning techniques, along with an inference speed improvement of up to 1.86 times. This proves that EED is a powerful defense solution in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>CADCrafter: Generating Computer-Aided Design Models from Unconstrained Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating CAD digital twins from the physical world is crucial for manufacturing, design, and simulation. However, current methods typically rely on costly 3D scanning with labor-intensive post-processing. To provide a user-friendly design process, we explore the problem of reverse engineering from unconstrained real-world CAD images that can be easily captured by users of all experiences. However, the scarcity of real-world CAD data poses challenges in directly training such models. To tackle these challenges, we propose CADCrafter, an image-to-parametric CAD model generation framework that trains solely on synthetic textureless CAD data while testing on real-world images. To bridge the significant representation disparity between images and parametric CAD models, we introduce a geometry encoder to accurately capture diverse geometric features. Moreover, the texture-invariant properties of the geometric features can also facilitate the generalization to real-world scenarios. Since compiling CAD parameter sequences into explicit CAD models is a non-differentiable process, the network training inherently lacks explicit geometric supervision. To impose geometric validity constraints, we employ direct preference optimization (DPO) to fine-tune our model with the automatic code checker feedback on CAD sequence quality. Furthermore, we collected a real-world dataset, comprised of multi-view images and corresponding CAD command sequence pairs, to evaluate our method. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can robustly handle real unconstrained CAD images, and even generalize to unseen general objects.</description>

      <title>Continuous Locomotive Crowd Behavior Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling and reproducing crowd behaviors are important in various domains including psychology, robotics, transport engineering and virtual environments. Conventional methods have focused on synthesizing momentary scenes, which have difficulty in replicating the continuous nature of real-world crowds. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for automatically generating continuous, realistic crowd trajectories with heterogeneous behaviors and interactions among individuals. We first design a crowd emitter model. To do this, we obtain spatial layouts from single input images, including a segmentation map, appearance map, population density map and population probability, prior to crowd generation. The emitter then continually places individuals on the timeline by assigning independent behavior characteristics such as agents' type, pace, and start/end positions using diffusion models. Next, our crowd simulator produces their long-term locomotions. To simulate diverse actions, it can augment their behaviors based on a Markov chain. As a result, our overall framework populates the scenes with heterogeneous crowd behaviors by alternating between the proposed emitter and simulator. Note that all the components in the proposed framework are user-controllable. Lastly, we propose a benchmark protocol to evaluate the realism and quality of the generated crowds in terms of the scene-level population dynamics and the individual-level trajectory accuracy. We demonstrate that our approach effectively models diverse crowd behavior patterns and generalizes well across different geographical environments.

      <title>Enhancing Leaf Disease Classification Using GAT-GCN Hybrid Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agriculture plays a critical role in the global economy, providing livelihoods and ensuring food security for billions. As innovative agricultural practices become more widespread, the risk of crop diseases has increased, highlighting the urgent need for efficient, low-intervention disease identification methods. This research presents a hybrid model combining Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) for leaf disease classification. GCNs have been widely used for learning from graph-structured data, and GATs enhance this by incorporating attention mechanisms to focus on the most important neighbors. The methodology integrates superpixel segmentation for efficient feature extraction, partitioning images into meaningful, homogeneous regions that better capture localized features. The authors have employed an edge augmentation technique to enhance the robustness of the model. The edge augmentation technique has introduced a significant degree of generalization in the detection capabilities of the model. To further optimize training, weight initialization techniques are applied. The hybrid model is evaluated against the individual performance of the GCN and GAT models and the hybrid model achieved a precision of 0.9822, recall of 0.9818, and F1-score of 0.9818 in apple leaf disease classification, a precision of 0.9746, recall of 0.9744, and F1-score of 0.9743 in potato leaf disease classification, and a precision of 0.8801, recall of 0.8801, and F1-score of 0.8799 in sugarcane leaf disease classification. These results demonstrate the robustness and performance of the model, suggesting its potential to support sustainable agricultural practices through precise and effective disease detection. This work is a small step towards reducing the loss of crops and hence supporting sustainable goals of zero hunger and life on land.</description>

      <title>Bottom-Up Scattering Information Perception Network for SAR target recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning methods based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image target recognition tasks have been widely studied currently. The existing deep methods are insufficient to perceive and mine the scattering information of SAR images, resulting in performance bottlenecks and poor robustness of the algorithms. To this end, this paper proposes a novel bottom-up scattering information perception network for more interpretable target recognition by constructing the proprietary interpretation network for SAR images. Firstly, the localized scattering perceptron is proposed to replace the backbone feature extractor based on CNN networks to deeply mine the underlying scattering information of the target. Then, an unsupervised scattering part feature extraction model is proposed to robustly characterize the target scattering part information and provide fine-grained target representation. Finally, by aggregating the knowledge of target parts to form the complete target description, the interpretability and discriminative ability of the model is improved. We perform experiments on the FAST-Vehicle dataset and the SAR-ACD dataset to validate the performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>OCC-MLLM-CoT-Alpha: Towards Multi-stage Occlusion Recognition Based on Large Language Models via 3D-Aware Supervision and Chain-of-Thoughts Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comprehending occluded objects are not well studied in existing large-scale visual-language multi-modal models. Current state-of-the-art multi-modal large models struggles to provide satisfactory results in understanding occluded objects through universal visual encoders and supervised learning strategies. Therefore, we propose OCC-MLLM-CoT-Alpha, a multi-modal large vision language framework that integrates 3D-aware supervision and Chain-of-Thoughts guidance. Particularly, (1) we build a multi-modal large vision-language model framework which is consisted of a large multi-modal vision-language model and a 3D reconstruction expert model. (2) the corresponding multi-modal Chain-of-Thoughts is learned through a combination of supervised and reinforcement training strategies, allowing the multi-modal vision-language model to enhance the recognition ability with learned multi-modal chain-of-thoughts guidance. (3) A large-scale multi-modal chain-of-thoughts reasoning dataset, consisting of $110k$ samples of occluded objects held in hand, is built. In the evaluation, the proposed methods demonstrate decision score improvement of 15.75%,15.30%,16.98%,14.62%, and 4.42%,3.63%,6.94%,10.70% for two settings of a variety of state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Instruction Influence in Diffusion Transformers for Parallel Multi-Instruction-Guided Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing enables users to specify modifications using natural language, offering more flexibility and control. Among existing frameworks, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) outperform U-Net-based diffusion models in scalability and performance. However, while real-world scenarios often require concurrent execution of multiple instructions, step-by-step editing suffers from accumulated errors and degraded quality, and integrating multiple instructions with a single prompt usually results in incomplete edits due to instruction conflicts. We propose Instruction Influence Disentanglement (IID), a novel framework enabling parallel execution of multiple instructions in a single denoising process, designed for DiT-based models. By analyzing self-attention mechanisms in DiTs, we identify distinctive attention patterns in multi-instruction settings and derive instruction-specific attention masks to disentangle each instruction's influence. These masks guide the editing process to ensure localized modifications while preserving consistency in non-edited regions. Extensive experiments on open-source and custom datasets demonstrate that IID reduces diffusion steps while improving fidelity and instruction completion compared to existing baselines. The codes will be publicly released upon the acceptance of the paper.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Vision Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mamba-based vision models have gained extensive attention as a result of being computationally more efficient than attention-based models. However, spatial redundancy still exists in these models, represented by token and block redundancy. For token redundancy, we analytically find that early token pruning methods will result in inconsistency between training and inference or introduce extra computation for inference. Therefore, we customize token pruning to fit the Mamba structure by rearranging the pruned sequence before feeding it into the next Mamba block. For block redundancy, we allow each image to select SSM blocks dynamically based on an empirical observation that the inference speed of Mamba-based vision models is largely affected by the number of SSM blocks. Our proposed method, Dynamic Vision Mamba (DyVM), effectively reduces FLOPs with minor performance drops. We achieve a reduction of 35.2\% FLOPs with only a loss of accuracy of 1.7\% on Vim-S. It also generalizes well across different Mamba vision model architectures and different vision tasks. Our code will be made public.</description>

      <title>OrderChain: A General Prompting Paradigm to Improve Ordinal Understanding Ability of MLLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they continue to face challenges in achieving competitive performance on ordinal regression (OR; a.k.a. ordinal classification). To address this issue, this paper presents OrderChain, a novel and general prompting paradigm that improves the ordinal understanding ability of MLLMs by specificity and commonality modeling. Specifically, our OrderChain consists of a set of task-aware prompts to facilitate the specificity modeling of diverse OR tasks and a new range optimization Chain-of-Thought (RO-CoT), which learns a commonality way of thinking about OR tasks by uniformly decomposing them into multiple small-range optimization subtasks. Further, we propose a category recursive division (CRD) method to generate instruction candidate category prompts to support RO-CoT automatic optimization. Comprehensive experiments show that a Large Language and Vision Assistant (LLaVA) model with our OrderChain improves baseline LLaVA significantly on diverse OR datasets, e.g., from 47.5% to 93.2% accuracy on the Adience dataset for age estimation, and from 30.0% to 85.7% accuracy on the Diabetic Retinopathy dataset. Notably, LLaVA with our OrderChain also remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 27% on accuracy and 0.24 on MAE on the Adience dataset. To our best knowledge, our OrderChain is the first work that augments MLLMs for OR tasks, and the effectiveness is witnessed across a spectrum of OR datasets.</description>

      <title>DebGCD: Debiased Learning with Distribution Guidance for Generalized Category Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD). Given a dataset containing both labelled and unlabelled images, the objective is to categorize all images in the unlabelled subset, irrespective of whether they are from known or unknown classes. In GCD, an inherent label bias exists between known and unknown classes due to the lack of ground-truth labels for the latter. State-of-the-art methods in GCD leverage parametric classifiers trained through self-distillation with soft labels, leaving the bias issue unattended. Besides, they treat all unlabelled samples uniformly, neglecting variations in certainty levels and resulting in suboptimal learning. Moreover, the explicit identification of semantic distribution shifts between known and unknown classes, a vital aspect for effective GCD, has been neglected. To address these challenges, we introduce DebGCD, a \underline{Deb}iased learning with distribution guidance framework for \underline{GCD}. Initially, DebGCD co-trains an auxiliary debiased classifier in the same feature space as the GCD classifier, progressively enhancing the GCD features. Moreover, we introduce a semantic distribution detector in a separate feature space to implicitly boost the learning efficacy of GCD. Additionally, we employ a curriculum learning strategy based on semantic distribution certainty to steer the debiased learning at an optimized pace. Thorough evaluations on GCD benchmarks demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of our framework, highlighting its superiority.

      <title>SUEDE:Shared Unified Experts for Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to physical attacks (e.g., printed photos) and digital threats (e.g., DeepFake), which are currently being studied as independent visual tasks, such as Face Anti-Spoofing and Forgery Detection. The inherent differences among various attack types present significant challenges in identifying a common feature space, making it difficult to develop a unified framework for detecting data from both attack modalities simultaneously. Inspired by the efficacy of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in learning across diverse domains, we explore utilizing multiple experts to learn the distinct features of various attack types. However, the feature distributions of physical and digital attacks overlap and differ. This suggests that relying solely on distinct experts to learn the unique features of each attack type may overlook shared knowledge between them. To address these issues, we propose SUEDE, the Shared Unified Experts for Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection Enhancement. SUEDE combines a shared expert (always activated) to capture common features for both attack types and multiple routed experts (selectively activated) for specific attack types. Further, we integrate CLIP as the base network to ensure the shared expert benefits from prior visual knowledge and align visual-text representations in a unified space. Extensive results demonstrate SUEDE achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art unified detection methods.</description>

      <title>From Specificity to Generality: Revisiting Generalizable Artifacts in Detecting Face Deepfakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting deepfakes has been an increasingly important topic, especially given the rapid development of AI generation techniques. In this paper, we ask: How can we build a universal detection framework that is effective for most facial deepfakes? One significant challenge is the wide variety of deepfake generators available, resulting in varying forgery artifacts (e.g., lighting inconsistency, color mismatch, etc). But should we ``teach" the detector to learn all these artifacts separately? It is impossible and impractical to elaborate on them all. So the core idea is to pinpoint the more common and general artifacts across different deepfakes. Accordingly, we categorize deepfake artifacts into two distinct yet complementary types: Face Inconsistency Artifacts (FIA) and Up-Sampling Artifacts (USA). FIA arise from the challenge of generating all intricate details, inevitably causing inconsistencies between the complex facial features and relatively uniform surrounding areas. USA, on the other hand, are the inevitable traces left by the generator's decoder during the up-sampling process. This categorization stems from the observation that all existing deepfakes typically exhibit one or both of these artifacts. To achieve this, we propose a new data-level pseudo-fake creation framework that constructs fake samples with only the FIA and USA, without introducing extra less-general artifacts. Specifically, we employ a super-resolution to simulate the USA, while design a Blender module that uses image-level self-blending on diverse facial regions to create the FIA. We surprisingly found that, with this intuitive design, a standard image classifier trained only with our pseudo-fake data can non-trivially generalize well to unseen deepfakes.</description>

      <title>Learning Affine Correspondences by Integrating Geometric Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine correspondences have received significant attention due to their benefits in tasks like image matching and pose estimation. Existing methods for extracting affine correspondences still have many limitations in terms of performance; thus, exploring a new paradigm is crucial. In this paper, we present a new pipeline designed for extracting accurate affine correspondences by integrating dense matching and geometric constraints. Specifically, a novel extraction framework is introduced, with the aid of dense matching and a novel keypoint scale and orientation estimator. For this purpose, we propose loss functions based on geometric constraints, which can effectively improve accuracy by supervising neural networks to learn feature geometry. The experimental show that the accuracy and robustness of our method outperform the existing ones in image matching tasks. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we applied it to relative pose estimation. Affine correspondences extracted by our method lead to more accurate poses than the baselines on a range of real-world datasets.

      <title>Inland Waterway Object Detection in Multi-environment: Dataset and Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of deep learning in intelligent ship visual perception relies heavily on rich image data. However, dedicated datasets for inland waterway vessels remain scarce, limiting the adaptability of visual perception systems in complex environments. Inland waterways, characterized by narrow channels, variable weather, and urban interference, pose significant challenges to object detection systems based on existing datasets. To address these issues, this paper introduces the Multi-environment Inland Waterway Vessel Dataset (MEIWVD), comprising 32,478 high-quality images from diverse scenarios, including sunny, rainy, foggy, and artificial lighting conditions. MEIWVD covers common vessel types in the Yangtze River Basin, emphasizing diversity, sample independence, environmental complexity, and multi-scale characteristics, making it a robust benchmark for vessel detection. Leveraging MEIWVD, this paper proposes a scene-guided image enhancement module to improve water surface images based on environmental conditions adaptively. Additionally, a parameter-limited dilated convolution enhances the representation of vessel features, while a multi-scale dilated residual fusion method integrates multi-scale features for better detection. Experiments show that MEIWVD provides a more rigorous benchmark for object detection algorithms, and the proposed methods significantly improve detector performance, especially in complex multi-environment scenarios.</description>

      <title>Uni4D: A Unified Self-Supervised Learning Framework for Point Cloud Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud video representation learning is primarily built upon the masking strategy in a self-supervised manner. However, the progress is slow due to several significant challenges: (1) existing methods learn the motion particularly with hand-crafted designs, leading to unsatisfactory motion patterns during pre-training which are non-transferable on fine-tuning scenarios. (2) previous Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) frameworks are limited in resolving the huge representation gap inherent in 4D data. In this study, we introduce the first self-disentangled MAE for learning discriminative 4D representations in the pre-training stage. To address the first challenge, we propose to model the motion representation in a latent space. The second issue is resolved by introducing the latent tokens along with the typical geometry tokens to disentangle high-level and low-level features during decoding. Extensive experiments on MSR-Action3D, NTU-RGBD, HOI4D, NvGesture, and SHREC'17 verify this self-disentangled learning framework. We demonstrate that it can boost the fine-tuning performance on all 4D tasks, which we term Uni4D. Our pre-trained model presents discriminative and meaningful 4D representations, particularly benefits processing long videos, as Uni4D gets $+3.8\%$ segmentation accuracy on HOI4D, significantly outperforming either self-supervised or fully-supervised methods after end-to-end fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Prior2Former -- Evidential Modeling of Mask Transformers for Assumption-Free Open-World Panoptic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In panoptic segmentation, individual instances must be separated within semantic classes. As state-of-the-art methods rely on a pre-defined set of classes, they struggle with novel categories and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This is particularly problematic in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving, where reliability in unseen scenarios is essential. We address the gap between outstanding benchmark performance and reliability by proposing Prior2Former (P2F), the first approach for segmentation vision transformers rooted in evidential learning. P2F extends the mask vision transformer architecture by incorporating a Beta prior for computing model uncertainty in pixel-wise binary mask assignments. This design enables high-quality uncertainty estimation that effectively detects novel and OOD objects enabling state-of-the-art anomaly instance segmentation and open-world panoptic segmentation. Unlike most segmentation models addressing unknown classes, P2F operates without access to OOD data samples or contrastive training on void (i.e., unlabeled) classes, making it highly applicable in real-world scenarios where such prior information is unavailable. Additionally, P2F can be flexibly applied to anomaly instance and panoptic segmentation. Through comprehensive experiments on the Cityscapes, COCO, SegmentMeIfYouCan, and OoDIS datasets, we demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of P2F. It achieves the highest ranking in the OoDIS anomaly instance benchmark among methods not using OOD data in any way.</description>

      <title>FantasyTalking: Realistic Talking Portrait Generation via Coherent Motion Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating a realistic animatable avatar from a single static portrait remains challenging. Existing approaches often struggle to capture subtle facial expressions, the associated global body movements, and the dynamic background. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that leverages a pretrained video diffusion transformer model to generate high-fidelity, coherent talking portraits with controllable motion dynamics. At the core of our work is a dual-stage audio-visual alignment strategy. In the first stage, we employ a clip-level training scheme to establish coherent global motion by aligning audio-driven dynamics across the entire scene, including the reference portrait, contextual objects, and background. In the second stage, we refine lip movements at the frame level using a lip-tracing mask, ensuring precise synchronization with audio signals. To preserve identity without compromising motion flexibility, we replace the commonly used reference network with a facial-focused cross-attention module that effectively maintains facial consistency throughout the video. Furthermore, we integrate a motion intensity modulation module that explicitly controls expression and body motion intensity, enabling controllable manipulation of portrait movements beyond mere lip motion. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed approach achieves higher quality with better realism, coherence, motion intensity, and identity preservation.

      <title>Content-Aware Transformer for All-in-one Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image restoration has witnessed significant advancements with the development of deep learning models. Although Transformer architectures have progressed considerably in recent years, challenges remain, particularly the limited receptive field in window-based self-attention. In this work, we propose DSwinIR, a Deformable Sliding window Transformer for Image Restoration. DSwinIR introduces a novel deformable sliding window self-attention that adaptively adjusts receptive fields based on image content, enabling the attention mechanism to focus on important regions and enhance feature extraction aligned with salient features. Additionally, we introduce a central ensemble pattern to reduce the inclusion of irrelevant content within attention windows. In this way, the proposed DSwinIR model integrates the deformable sliding window Transformer and central ensemble pattern to amplify the strengths of both CNNs and Transformers while mitigating their limitations. Extensive experiments on various image restoration tasks demonstrate that DSwinIR achieves state-of-the-art performance. For example, in image deraining, compared to DRSformer on the SPA dataset, DSwinIR achieves a 0.66 dB PSNR improvement. In all-in-one image restoration, compared to PromptIR, DSwinIR achieves over a 0.66 dB and 1.04 dB improvement on three-task and five-task settings, respectively. Pretrained models and code are available at our project https://github.com/Aitical/DSwinIR.</description>

      <title>SCAM: A Real-World Typographic Robustness Evaluation for Multimodal Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit the interplay between text and visual content in multimodal foundation models, causing misclassifications when misleading text is embedded within images. However, existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1,162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings reveal that typographic attacks persist in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the choice of their vision encoder, though larger Large Language Models (LLMs) backbones help mitigate their vulnerability. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems. We publicly release the datasets introduced in this paper under https://huggingface.co/datasets/BLISS-e-V/SCAM, along with the code for evaluations at https://github.com/Bliss-e-V/SCAM.</description>

      <title>Lumina-OmniLV: A Unified Multimodal Framework for General Low-Level Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Lunima-OmniLV (abbreviated as OmniLV), a universal multimodal multi-task framework for low-level vision that addresses over 100 sub-tasks across four major categories: image restoration, image enhancement, weak-semantic dense prediction, and stylization. OmniLV leverages both textual and visual prompts to offer flexible and user-friendly interactions. Built on Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based generative priors, our framework supports arbitrary resolutions -- achieving optimal performance at 1K resolution -- while preserving fine-grained details and high fidelity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that separately encoding text and visual instructions, combined with co-training using shallow feature control, is essential to mitigate task ambiguity and enhance multi-task generalization. Our findings also reveal that integrating high-level generative tasks into low-level vision models can compromise detail-sensitive restoration. These insights pave the way for more robust and generalizable low-level vision systems.</description>

      <title>Video-Bench: Human-Aligned Video Generation Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generation assessment is essential for ensuring that generative models produce visually realistic, high-quality videos while aligning with human expectations. Current video generation benchmarks fall into two main categories: traditional benchmarks, which use metrics and embeddings to evaluate generated video quality across multiple dimensions but often lack alignment with human judgments; and large language model (LLM)-based benchmarks, though capable of human-like reasoning, are constrained by a limited understanding of video quality metrics and cross-modal consistency. To address these challenges and establish a benchmark that better aligns with human preferences, this paper introduces Video-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring a rich prompt suite and extensive evaluation dimensions. This benchmark represents the first attempt to systematically leverage MLLMs across all dimensions relevant to video generation assessment in generative models. By incorporating few-shot scoring and chain-of-query techniques, Video-Bench provides a structured, scalable approach to generated video evaluation. Experiments on advanced models including Sora demonstrate that Video-Bench achieves superior alignment with human preferences across all dimensions. Moreover, in instances where our framework's assessments diverge from human evaluations, it consistently offers more objective and accurate insights, suggesting an even greater potential advantage over traditional human judgment.</description>

      <title>IterMask3D: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Segmentation with Test-Time Iterative Mask Refinement in 3D Brain MR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection and segmentation methods train a model to learn the training distribution as 'normal'. In the testing phase, they identify patterns that deviate from this normal distribution as 'anomalies'. To learn the `normal' distribution, prevailing methods corrupt the images and train a model to reconstruct them. During testing, the model attempts to reconstruct corrupted inputs based on the learned 'normal' distribution. Deviations from this distribution lead to high reconstruction errors, which indicate potential anomalies. However, corrupting an input image inevitably causes information loss even in normal regions, leading to suboptimal reconstruction and an increased risk of false positives. To alleviate this, we propose IterMask3D, an iterative spatial mask-refining strategy designed for 3D brain MRI. We iteratively spatially mask areas of the image as corruption and reconstruct them, then shrink the mask based on reconstruction error. This process iteratively unmasks 'normal' areas to the model, whose information further guides reconstruction of 'normal' patterns under the mask to be reconstructed accurately, reducing false positives. In addition, to achieve better reconstruction performance, we also propose using high-frequency image content as additional structural information to guide the reconstruction of the masked area. Extensive experiments on the detection of both synthetic and real-world imaging artifacts, as well as segmentation of various pathological lesions across multiple MRI sequences, consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Inter-event Interval Microscopy for Event Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras, an innovative bio-inspired sensor, differ from traditional cameras by sensing changes in intensity rather than directly perceiving intensity and recording these variations as a continuous stream of "events". The intensity reconstruction from these sparse events has long been a challenging problem. Previous approaches mainly focused on transforming motion-induced events into videos or achieving intensity imaging for static scenes by integrating modulation devices at the event camera acquisition end. In this paper, for the first time, we achieve event-to-intensity conversion using a static event camera for both static and dynamic scenes in fluorescence microscopy. Unlike conventional methods that primarily rely on event integration, the proposed Inter-event Interval Microscopy (IEIM) quantifies the time interval between consecutive events at each pixel. With a fixed threshold in the event camera, the time interval can precisely represent the intensity. At the hardware level, the proposed IEIM integrates a pulse light modulation device within a microscope equipped with an event camera, termed Pulse Modulation-based Event-driven Fluorescence Microscopy.mAdditionally, we have collected IEIMat dataset under various scenes including high dynamic range and high-speed scenarios. Experimental results on the IEIMat dataset demonstrate that the proposed IEIM achieves superior spatial and temporal resolution, as well as a higher dynamic range, with lower bandwidth compared to other methods. The code and the IEIMat dataset will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>RCCFormer: A Robust Crowd Counting Network Based on Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crowd counting, which is a key computer vision task, has emerged as a fundamental technology in crowd analysis and public safety management. However, challenges such as scale variations and complex backgrounds significantly impact the accuracy of crowd counting. To mitigate these issues, this paper proposes a robust Transformer-based crowd counting network, termed RCCFormer, specifically designed for background suppression and scale awareness. The proposed method incorporates a Multi-level Feature Fusion Module (MFFM), which meticulously integrates features extracted at diverse stages of the backbone architecture. It establishes a strong baseline capable of capturing intricate and comprehensive feature representations, surpassing traditional baselines. Furthermore, the introduced Detail-Embedded Attention Block (DEAB) captures contextual information and local details through global self-attention and local attention along with a learnable manner for efficient fusion. This enhances the model's ability to focus on foreground regions while effectively mitigating background noise interference. Additionally, we develop an Adaptive Scale-Aware Module (ASAM), with our novel Input-dependent Deformable Convolution (IDConv) as its fundamental building block. This module dynamically adapts to changes in head target shapes and scales, significantly improving the network's capability to accommodate large-scale variations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on the ShanghaiTech Part_A and Part_B, NWPU-Crowd, and QNRF datasets. The results demonstrate that our RCCFormer achieves excellent performance across all four datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art outcomes.</description>

      <title>Towards Visual Text Grounding of Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the existing evolution of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a non-neglectable limitation remains in their struggle with visual text grounding, especially in text-rich images of documents. Document images, such as scanned forms and infographics, highlight critical challenges due to their complex layouts and textual content. However, current benchmarks do not fully address these challenges, as they mostly focus on visual grounding on natural images, rather than text-rich document images. Thus, to bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG, a novel task with a newly designed instruction dataset for benchmarking and improving the Text-Rich Image Grounding capabilities of MLLMs in document question-answering. Specifically, we propose an OCR-LLM-human interaction pipeline to create 800 manually annotated question-answer pairs as a benchmark and a large-scale training set of 90$ synthetic data based on four diverse datasets. A comprehensive evaluation of various MLLMs on our proposed benchmark exposes substantial limitations in their grounding capability on text-rich images. In addition, we propose two simple and effective TRIG methods based on general instruction tuning and plug-and-play efficient embedding, respectively. By finetuning MLLMs on our synthetic dataset, they promisingly improve spatial reasoning and grounding capabilities.</description>

      <title>DiCoTTA: Domain-invariant Learning for Continual Test-time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies continual test-time adaptation (CTTA), the task of adapting a model to constantly changing unseen domains in testing while preserving previously learned knowledge. Existing CTTA methods mostly focus on adaptation to the current test domain only, overlooking generalization to arbitrary test domains a model may face in the future. To tackle this limitation, we present a novel online domain-invariant learning framework for CTTA, dubbed DiCoTTA. DiCoTTA aims to learn feature representation to be invariant to both current and previous test domains on the fly during testing. To this end, we propose a new model architecture and a test-time adaptation strategy dedicated to learning domain-invariant features without corrupting semantic contents, along with a new data structure and optimization algorithm for effectively managing information from previous test domains. DiCoTTA achieved state-of-the-art performance on four public CTTA benchmarks. Moreover, it showed superior generalization to unseen test domains.</description>

Abstract: Recent progress in VLMs has demonstrated impressive capabilities across a variety of tasks in the natural image domain. Motivated by these advancements, the remote sensing community has begun to adopt VLMs for remote sensing vision-language tasks, including scene understanding, image captioning, and visual question answering. However, existing remote sensing VLMs typically rely on closed-set scene understanding and focus on generic scene descriptions, yet lack the ability to incorporate external knowledge. This limitation hinders their capacity for semantic reasoning over complex or context-dependent queries that involve domain-specific or world knowledge. To address these challenges, we first introduced a multimodal Remote Sensing World Knowledge (RSWK) dataset, which comprises high-resolution satellite imagery and detailed textual descriptions for 14,141 well-known landmarks from 175 countries, integrating both remote sensing domain knowledge and broader world knowledge. Building upon this dataset, we proposed a novel Remote Sensing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RS-RAG) framework, which consists of two key components. The Multi-Modal Knowledge Vector Database Construction module encodes remote sensing imagery and associated textual knowledge into a unified vector space. The Knowledge Retrieval and Response Generation module retrieves and re-ranks relevant knowledge based on image and/or text queries, and incorporates the retrieved content into a knowledge-augmented prompt to guide the VLM in producing contextually grounded responses. We validated the effectiveness of our approach on three representative vision-language tasks, including image captioning, image classification, and visual question answering, where RS-RAG significantly outperformed state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>AsyReC: A Multimodal Graph-based Framework for Spatio-Temporal Asymmetric Dyadic Relationship Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dyadic social relationships, which refer to relationships between two individuals who know each other through repeated interactions (or not), are shaped by shared spatial and temporal experiences. Current computational methods for modeling these relationships face three major challenges: (1) the failure to model asymmetric relationships, e.g., one individual may perceive the other as a friend while the other perceives them as an acquaintance, (2) the disruption of continuous interactions by discrete frame sampling, which segments the temporal continuity of interaction in real-world scenarios, and (3) the limitation to consider periodic behavioral cues, such as rhythmic vocalizations or recurrent gestures, which are crucial for inferring the evolution of dyadic relationships. To address these challenges, we propose AsyReC, a multimodal graph-based framework for asymmetric dyadic relationship classification, with three core innovations: (i) a triplet graph neural network with node-edge dual attention that dynamically weights multimodal cues to capture interaction asymmetries (addressing challenge 1); (ii) a clip-level relationship learning architecture that preserves temporal continuity, enabling fine-grained modeling of real-world interaction dynamics (addressing challenge 2); and (iii) a periodic temporal encoder that projects time indices onto sine/cosine waveforms to model recurrent behavioral patterns (addressing challenge 3). Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, while ablation studies validate the critical role of asymmetric interaction modeling and periodic temporal encoding in improving the robustness of dyadic relationship classification in real-world scenarios.

      <title>InstructionBench: An Instructional Video Understanding Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite progress in video large language models (Video-LLMs), research on instructional video understanding, crucial for enhancing access to instructional content, remains insufficient. To address this, we introduce InstructionBench, an Instructional video understanding Benchmark, which challenges models' advanced temporal reasoning within instructional videos characterized by their strict step-by-step flow. Employing GPT-4, we formulate Q\&amp;A pairs in open-ended and multiple-choice formats to assess both Coarse-Grained event-level and Fine-Grained object-level reasoning. Our filtering strategies exclude questions answerable purely by common-sense knowledge, focusing on visual perception and analysis when evaluating Video-LLM models. The benchmark finally contains 5k questions across over 700 videos. We evaluate the latest Video-LLMs on our InstructionBench, finding that closed-source models outperform open-source ones. However, even the best model, GPT-4o, achieves only 53.42\% accuracy, indicating significant gaps in temporal reasoning. To advance the field, we also develop a comprehensive instructional video dataset with over 19k Q\&amp;A pairs from nearly 2.5k videos, using an automated data generation framework, thereby enriching the community's research resources.</description>

      <title>MotionPRO: Exploring the Role of Pressure in Human MoCap and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing human Motion Capture (MoCap) methods mostly focus on the visual similarity while neglecting the physical plausibility. As a result, downstream tasks such as driving virtual human in 3D scene or humanoid robots in real world suffer from issues such as timing drift and jitter, spatial problems like sliding and penetration, and poor global trajectory accuracy. In this paper, we revisit human MoCap from the perspective of interaction between human body and physical world by exploring the role of pressure. Firstly, we construct a large-scale human Motion capture dataset with Pressure, RGB and Optical sensors (named MotionPRO), which comprises 70 volunteers performing 400 types of motion, encompassing a total of 12.4M pose frames. Secondly, we examine both the necessity and effectiveness of the pressure signal through two challenging tasks: (1) pose and trajectory estimation based solely on pressure: We propose a network that incorporates a small kernel decoder and a long-short-term attention module, and proof that pressure could provide accurate global trajectory and plausible lower body pose. (2) pose and trajectory estimation by fusing pressure and RGB: We impose constraints on orthographic similarity along the camera axis and whole-body contact along the vertical axis to enhance the cross-attention strategy to fuse pressure and RGB feature maps. Experiments demonstrate that fusing pressure with RGB features not only significantly improves performance in terms of objective metrics, but also plausibly drives virtual humans (SMPL) in 3D scene. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating physical perception enables humanoid robots to perform more precise and stable actions, which is highly beneficial for the development of embodied artificial intelligence.

      <title>CMaP-SAM: Contraction Mapping Prior for SAM-driven Few-shot Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment new classes using few annotated images. While recent FSS methods have shown considerable improvements by leveraging Segment Anything Model (SAM), they face two critical limitations: insufficient utilization of structural correlations in query images, and significant information loss when converting continuous position priors to discrete point prompts. To address these challenges, we propose CMaP-SAM, a novel framework that introduces contraction mapping theory to optimize position priors for SAM-driven few-shot segmentation. CMaP-SAM consists of three key components: (1) a contraction mapping module that formulates position prior optimization as a Banach contraction mapping with convergence guarantees. This module iteratively refines position priors through pixel-wise structural similarity, generating a converged prior that preserves both semantic guidance from reference images and structural correlations in query images; (2) an adaptive distribution alignment module bridging continuous priors with SAM's binary mask prompt encoder; and (3) a foreground-background decoupled refinement architecture producing accurate final segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate CMaP-SAM's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 71.1 mIoU on PASCAL-$5^i$ and 56.1 on COCO-$20^i$ datasets.</description>

      <title>LDGNet: A Lightweight Difference Guiding Network for Remote Sensing Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, the field of change detection (CD) in remote sensing imagery has achieved remarkable progress. Existing change detection methods primarily focus on achieving higher accuracy with increased computational costs and parameter sizes, leaving development of lightweight methods for rapid real-world processing an underexplored challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a Lightweight Difference Guiding Network (LDGNet), leveraging absolute difference image to guide optical remote sensing change detection. First, to enhance the feature representation capability of the lightweight backbone network, we propose the Difference Guiding Module (DGM), which leverages multi-scale features extracted from the absolute difference image to progressively influence the original image encoder at each layer, thereby reinforcing feature extraction. Second, we propose the Difference-Aware Dynamic Fusion (DADF) module with Visual State Space Model (VSSM) for lightweight long-range dependency modeling. The module first uses feature absolute differences to guide VSSM's global contextual modeling of change regions, then employs difference attention to dynamically fuse these long-range features with feature differences, enhancing change semantics while suppressing noise and background. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or superior performance to current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods requiring several times more computation, while maintaining only 3.43M parameters and 1.12G FLOPs.</description>

      <title>PvNeXt: Rethinking Network Design and Temporal Motion for Point Cloud Video Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud video perception has become an essential task for the realm of 3D vision. Current 4D representation learning techniques typically engage in iterative processing coupled with dense query operations. Although effective in capturing temporal features, this approach leads to substantial computational redundancy. In this work, we propose a framework, named as PvNeXt, for effective yet efficient point cloud video recognition, via personalized one-shot query operation. Specially, PvNeXt consists of two key modules, the Motion Imitator and the Single-Step Motion Encoder. The former module, the Motion Imitator, is designed to capture the temporal dynamics inherent in sequences of point clouds, thus generating the virtual motion corresponding to each frame. The Single-Step Motion Encoder performs a one-step query operation, associating point cloud of each frame with its corresponding virtual motion frame, thereby extracting motion cues from point cloud sequences and capturing temporal dynamics across the entire sequence. Through the integration of these two modules, {PvNeXt} enables personalized one-shot queries for each frame, effectively eliminating the need for frame-specific looping and intensive query processes. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Content-Distortion High-Order Interaction for Blind Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The content and distortion are widely recognized as the two primary factors affecting the visual quality of an image. While existing No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) methods have modeled these factors, they fail to capture the complex interactions between content and distortions. This shortfall impairs their ability to accurately perceive quality. To confront this, we analyze the key properties required for interaction modeling and propose a robust NR-IQA approach termed CoDI-IQA (Content-Distortion high-order Interaction for NR-IQA), which aggregates local distortion and global content features within a hierarchical interaction framework. Specifically, a Progressive Perception Interaction Module (PPIM) is proposed to explicitly simulate how content and distortions independently and jointly influence image quality. By integrating internal interaction, coarse interaction, and fine interaction, it achieves high-order interaction modeling that allows the model to properly represent the underlying interaction patterns. To ensure sufficient interaction, multiple PPIMs are employed to hierarchically fuse multi-level content and distortion features at different granularities. We also tailor a training strategy suited for CoDI-IQA to maintain interaction stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method notably outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy, data efficiency, and generalization ability.</description>

      <title>Climplicit: Climatic Implicit Embeddings for Global Ecological Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning on climatic data holds potential for macroecological applications. However, its adoption remains limited among scientists outside the deep learning community due to storage, compute, and technical expertise barriers. To address this, we introduce Climplicit, a spatio-temporal geolocation encoder pretrained to generate implicit climatic representations anywhere on Earth. By bypassing the need to download raw climatic rasters and train feature extractors, our model uses x1000 fewer disk space and significantly reduces computational needs for downstream tasks. We evaluate our Climplicit embeddings on biomes classification, species distribution modeling, and plant trait regression. We find that linear probing our Climplicit embeddings consistently performs better or on par with training a model from scratch on downstream tasks and overall better than alternative geolocation encoding models.</description>

      <title>ABCDWaveNet: Advancing Robust Road Ponding Detection in Fog through Dynamic Frequency-Spatial Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Road ponding presents a significant threat to vehicle safety, particularly in adverse fog conditions, where reliable detection remains a persistent challenge for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). To address this, we propose ABCDWaveNet, a novel deep learning framework leveraging Dynamic Frequency-Spatial Synergy for robust ponding detection in fog. The core of ABCDWaveNet achieves this synergy by integrating dynamic convolution for adaptive feature extraction across varying visibilities with a wavelet-based module for synergistic frequency-spatial feature enhancement, significantly improving robustness against fog interference. Building on this foundation, ABCDWaveNet captures multi-scale structural and contextual information, subsequently employing an Adaptive Attention Coupling Gate (AACG) to adaptively fuse global and local features for enhanced accuracy. To facilitate realistic evaluations under combined adverse conditions, we introduce the Foggy Low-Light Puddle dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ABCDWaveNet establishes new state-of-the-art performance, achieving significant Intersection over Union (IoU) gains of 3.51%, 1.75%, and 1.03% on the Foggy-Puddle, Puddle-1000, and our Foggy Low-Light Puddle datasets, respectively. Furthermore, its processing speed of 25.48 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin confirms its suitability for ADAS deployment. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed Dynamic Frequency-Spatial Synergy within ABCDWaveNet, offering valuable insights for developing proactive road safety solutions capable of operating reliably in challenging weather conditions.</description>

      <title>DA2Diff: Exploring Degradation-aware Adaptive Diffusion Priors for All-in-One Weather Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image restoration under adverse weather conditions is a critical task for many vision-based applications. Recent all-in-one frameworks that handle multiple weather degradations within a unified model have shown potential. However, the diversity of degradation patterns across different weather conditions, as well as the complex and varied nature of real-world degradations, pose significant challenges for multiple weather removal. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative diffusion paradigm with degradation-aware adaptive priors for all-in-one weather restoration, termed DA2Diff. It is a new exploration that applies CLIP to perceive degradation-aware properties for better multi-weather restoration. Specifically, we deploy a set of learnable prompts to capture degradation-aware representations by the prompt-image similarity constraints in the CLIP space. By aligning the snowy/hazy/rainy images with snow/haze/rain prompts, each prompt contributes to different weather degradation characteristics. The learned prompts are then integrated into the diffusion model via the designed weather specific prompt guidance module, making it possible to restore multiple weather types. To further improve the adaptiveness to complex weather degradations, we propose a dynamic expert selection modulator that employs a dynamic weather-aware router to flexibly dispatch varying numbers of restoration experts for each weather-distorted image, allowing the diffusion model to restore diverse degradations adaptively. Experimental results substantiate the favorable performance of DA2Diff over state-of-the-arts in quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Source code will be available after acceptance.</description>

      <title>BoxSeg: Quality-Aware and Peer-Assisted Learning for Box-supervised Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Box-supervised instance segmentation methods aim to achieve instance segmentation with only box annotations. Recent methods have demonstrated the effectiveness of acquiring high-quality pseudo masks under the teacher-student framework. Building upon this foundation, we propose a BoxSeg framework involving two novel and general modules named the Quality-Aware Module (QAM) and the Peer-assisted Copy-paste (PC). The QAM obtains high-quality pseudo masks and better measures the mask quality to help reduce the effect of noisy masks, by leveraging the quality-aware multi-mask complementation mechanism. The PC imitates Peer-Assisted Learning to further improve the quality of the low-quality masks with the guidance of the obtained high-quality pseudo masks. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate the proposed QAM and PC are effective. Extensive experimental results show the superiority of our BoxSeg over the state-of-the-art methods, and illustrate the QAM and PC can be applied to improve other models.</description>

      <title>EffOWT: Transfer Visual Language Models to Open-World Tracking Efficiently and Effectively</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-World Tracking (OWT) aims to track every object of any category, which requires the model to have strong generalization capabilities. Trackers can improve their generalization ability by leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs). However, challenges arise with the fine-tuning strategies when VLMs are transferred to OWT: full fine-tuning results in excessive parameter and memory costs, while the zero-shot strategy leads to sub-optimal performance. To solve the problem, EffOWT is proposed for efficiently transferring VLMs to OWT. Specifically, we build a small and independent learnable side network outside the VLM backbone. By freezing the backbone and only executing backpropagation on the side network, the model's efficiency requirements can be met. In addition, EffOWT enhances the side network by proposing a hybrid structure of Transformer and CNN to improve the model's performance in the OWT field. Finally, we implement sparse interactions on the MLP, thus reducing parameter updates and memory costs significantly. Thanks to the proposed methods, EffOWT achieves an absolute gain of 5.5% on the tracking metric OWTA for unknown categories, while only updating 1.3% of the parameters compared to full fine-tuning, with a 36.4% memory saving. Other metrics also demonstrate obvious improvement.</description>

      <title>Stereo-LiDAR Fusion by Semi-Global Matching With Discrete Disparity-Matching Cost and Semidensification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a real-time, non-learning depth estimation method that fuses Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data with stereo camera input. Our approach comprises three key techniques: Semi-Global Matching (SGM) stereo with Discrete Disparity-matching Cost (DDC), semidensification of LiDAR disparity, and a consistency check that combines stereo images and LiDAR data. Each of these components is designed for parallelization on a GPU to realize real-time performance. When it was evaluated on the KITTI dataset, the proposed method achieved an error rate of 2.79\%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art real-time stereo-LiDAR fusion method, which had an error rate of 3.05\%. Furthermore, we tested the proposed method in various scenarios, including different LiDAR point densities, varying weather conditions, and indoor environments, to demonstrate its high adaptability. We believe that the real-time and non-learning nature of our method makes it highly practical for applications in robotics and automation.</description>

      <title>PanoDreamer: Consistent Text to 360-Degree Scene Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatically generating a complete 3D scene from a text description, a reference image, or both has significant applications in fields like virtual reality and gaming. However, current methods often generate low-quality textures and inconsistent 3D structures. This is especially true when extrapolating significantly beyond the field of view of the reference image. To address these challenges, we propose PanoDreamer, a novel framework for consistent, 3D scene generation with flexible text and image control. Our approach employs a large language model and a warp-refine pipeline, first generating an initial set of images and then compositing them into a 360-degree panorama. This panorama is then lifted into 3D to form an initial point cloud. We then use several approaches to generate additional images, from different viewpoints, that are consistent with the initial point cloud and expand/refine the initial point cloud. Given the resulting set of images, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting to create the final 3D scene, which can then be rendered from different viewpoints. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PanoDreamer in generating high-quality, geometrically consistent 3D scenes.</description>

      <title>Balancing Task-invariant Interaction and Task-specific Adaptation for Unified Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unified image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from multi-source images, enhancing image quality through a unified framework applicable to diverse fusion tasks. While treating all fusion tasks as a unified problem facilitates task-invariant knowledge sharing, it often overlooks task-specific characteristics, thereby limiting the overall performance. Existing general image fusion methods incorporate explicit task identification to enable adaptation to different fusion tasks. However, this dependence during inference restricts the model's generalization to unseen fusion tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel unified image fusion framework named "TITA", which dynamically balances both Task-invariant Interaction and Task-specific Adaptation. For task-invariant interaction, we introduce the Interaction-enhanced Pixel Attention (IPA) module to enhance pixel-wise interactions for better multi-source complementary information extraction. For task-specific adaptation, the Operation-based Adaptive Fusion (OAF) module dynamically adjusts operation weights based on task properties. Additionally, we incorporate the Fast Adaptive Multitask Optimization (FAMO) strategy to mitigate the impact of gradient conflicts across tasks during joint training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TITA not only achieves competitive performance compared to specialized methods across three image fusion scenarios but also exhibits strong generalization to unseen fusion tasks.</description>

      <title>SSLFusion: Scale &amp; Space Aligned Latent Fusion Model for Multimodal 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal 3D object detection based on deep neural networks has indeed made significant progress. However, it still faces challenges due to the misalignment of scale and spatial information between features extracted from 2D images and those derived from 3D point clouds. Existing methods usually aggregate multimodal features at a single stage. However, leveraging multi-stage cross-modal features is crucial for detecting objects of various scales. Therefore, these methods often struggle to integrate features across different scales and modalities effectively, thereby restricting the accuracy of detection. Additionally, the time-consuming Query-Key-Value-based (QKV-based) cross-attention operations often utilized in existing methods aid in reasoning the location and existence of objects by capturing non-local contexts. However, this approach tends to increase computational complexity. To address these challenges, we present SSLFusion, a novel Scale &amp; Space Aligned Latent Fusion Model, consisting of a scale-aligned fusion strategy (SAF), a 3D-to-2D space alignment module (SAM), and a latent cross-modal fusion module (LFM). SAF mitigates scale misalignment between modalities by aggregating features from both images and point clouds across multiple levels. SAM is designed to reduce the inter-modal gap between features from images and point clouds by incorporating 3D coordinate information into 2D image features. Additionally, LFM captures cross-modal non-local contexts in the latent space without utilizing the QKV-based attention operations, thus mitigating computational complexity. Experiments on the KITTI and DENSE datasets demonstrate that our SSLFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach obtains an absolute gain of 2.15% in 3D AP, compared with the state-of-art method GraphAlign on the moderate level of the KITTI test set.</description>

      <title>The 1st Solution for 4th PVUW MeViS Challenge: Unleashing the Potential of Large Multimodal Models for Referring Video Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion expression video segmentation is designed to segment objects in accordance with the input motion expressions. In contrast to the conventional Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS), it places emphasis on motion as well as multi-object expressions, making it more arduous. Recently, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have begun to shine in RVOS due to their powerful vision-language perception capabilities. In this work, we propose a simple and effective inference optimization method to fully unleash the potential of LMMs in referring video segmentation. Firstly, we use Sa2VA as our baseline, which is a unified LMM for dense grounded understanding of both images and videos. Secondly, we uniformly sample the video frames during the inference process to enhance the model's understanding of the entire video. Finally, we integrate the results of multiple expert models to mitigate the erroneous predictions of a single model. Our solution achieved 61.98% J&amp;F on the MeViS test set and ranked 1st place in the 4th PVUW Challenge MeViS Track at CVPR 2025.</description>

      <title>MSA-UNet3+: Multi-Scale Attention UNet3+ with New Supervised Prototypical Contrastive Loss for Coronary DSA Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate segmentation of coronary Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) images is essential for diagnosing and treating coronary artery diseases. Despite advances in deep learning-based segmentation, challenges such as low contrast, noise, overlapping structures, high intra-class variance, and class imbalance limit precise vessel delineation. To overcome these limitations, we propose the MSA-UNet3+: a Multi-Scale Attention enhanced UNet3+ architecture for coronary DSA image segmentation. The framework combined Multi-Scale Dilated Bottleneck (MSD-Bottleneck) with Contextual Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which not only enhances multi-scale feature extraction but also preserve fine-grained details, and improve contextual understanding. Furthermore, we propose a new Supervised Prototypical Contrastive Loss (SPCL), which combines supervised and prototypical contrastive learning to minimize class imbalance and high intra-class variance by focusing on hard-to-classified background samples. Experiments carried out on a private coronary DSA dataset demonstrate that MSA-UNet3+ outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a Dice coefficient of 87.73%, an F1-score of 87.78%, and significantly reduced Average Surface Distance (ASD) and Average Contour Distance (ACD). The developed framework provides clinicians with precise vessel segmentation, enabling accurate identification of coronary stenosis and supporting informed diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. The code will be released at the following GitHub profile link https://github.com/rayanmerghani/MSA-UNet3plus.</description>

      <title>Training state-of-the-art pathology foundation models with orders of magnitude less data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of computational pathology has recently seen rapid advances driven by the development of modern vision foundation models (FMs), typically trained on vast collections of pathology images. Recent studies demonstrate that increasing the training data set and model size and integrating domain-specific image processing techniques can significantly enhance the model's performance on downstream tasks. Building on these insights, our work incorporates several recent modifications to the standard DINOv2 framework from the literature to optimize the training of pathology FMs. We also apply a post-training procedure for fine-tuning models on higher-resolution images to further enrich the information encoded in the embeddings. We present three novel pathology FMs trained on up to two orders of magnitude fewer WSIs than those used to train other state-of-the-art FMs while demonstrating a comparable or superior performance on downstream tasks. Even the model trained on TCGA alone (12k WSIs) outperforms most existing FMs and, on average, matches Virchow2, the second-best FM published to date. This suggests that there still remains a significant potential for further improving the models and algorithms used to train pathology FMs to take full advantage of the vast data collections.</description>

      <title>3D Universal Lesion Detection and Tagging in CT with Self-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiologists routinely perform the tedious task of lesion localization, classification, and size measurement in computed tomography (CT) studies. Universal lesion detection and tagging (ULDT) can simultaneously help alleviate the cumbersome nature of lesion measurement and enable tumor burden assessment. Previous ULDT approaches utilize the publicly available DeepLesion dataset, however it does not provide the full volumetric (3D) extent of lesions and also displays a severe class imbalance. In this work, we propose a self-training pipeline to detect 3D lesions and tag them according to the body part they occur in. We used a significantly limited 30\% subset of DeepLesion to train a VFNet model for 2D lesion detection and tagging. Next, the 2D lesion context was expanded into 3D, and the mined 3D lesion proposals were integrated back into the baseline training data in order to retrain the model over multiple rounds. Through the self-training procedure, our VFNet model learned from its own predictions, detected lesions in 3D, and tagged them. Our results indicated that our VFNet model achieved an average sensitivity of 46.9\% at [0.125:8] false positives (FP) with a limited 30\% data subset in comparison to the 46.8\% of an existing approach that used the entire DeepLesion dataset. To our knowledge, we are the first to jointly detect lesions in 3D and tag them according to the body part label.</description>

      <title>Correcting Class Imbalances with Self-Training for Improved Universal Lesion Detection and Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal lesion detection and tagging (ULDT) in CT studies is critical for tumor burden assessment and tracking the progression of lesion status (growth/shrinkage) over time. However, a lack of fully annotated data hinders the development of effective ULDT approaches. Prior work used the DeepLesion dataset (4,427 patients, 10,594 studies, 32,120 CT slices, 32,735 lesions, 8 body part labels) for algorithmic development, but this dataset is not completely annotated and contains class imbalances. To address these issues, in this work, we developed a self-training pipeline for ULDT. A VFNet model was trained on a limited 11.5\% subset of DeepLesion (bounding boxes + tags) to detect and classify lesions in CT studies. Then, it identified and incorporated novel lesion candidates from a larger unseen data subset into its training set, and self-trained itself over multiple rounds. Multiple self-training experiments were conducted with different threshold policies to select predicted lesions with higher quality and cover the class imbalances. We discovered that direct self-training improved the sensitivities of over-represented lesion classes at the expense of under-represented classes. However, upsampling the lesions mined during self-training along with a variable threshold policy yielded a 6.5\% increase in sensitivity at 4 FP in contrast to self-training without class balancing (72\% vs 78.5\%) and a 11.7\% increase compared to the same self-training policy without upsampling (66.8\% vs 78.5\%). Furthermore, we show that our results either improved or maintained the sensitivity at 4FP for all 8 lesion classes.</description>

      <title>An ensemble deep learning approach to detect tumors on Mohs micrographic surgery slides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is the gold standard technique for removing high risk nonmelanoma skin cancer however, intraoperative histopathological examination demands significant time, effort, and professionality. The objective of this study is to develop a deep learning model to detect basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and artifacts on Mohs slides. A total of 731 Mohs slides from 51 patients with BCCs were used in this study, with 91 containing tumor and 640 without tumor which was defined as non-tumor. The dataset was employed to train U-Net based models that segment tumor and non-tumor regions on the slides. The segmented patches were classified as tumor, or non-tumor to produce predictions for whole slide images (WSIs). For the segmentation phase, the deep learning model success was measured using a Dice score with 0.70 and 0.67 value, area under the curve (AUC) score with 0.98 and 0.96 for tumor and non-tumor, respectively. For the tumor classification, an AUC of 0.98 for patch-based detection, and AUC of 0.91 for slide-based detection was obtained on the test dataset. We present an AI system that can detect tumors and non-tumors in Mohs slides with high success. Deep learning can aid Mohs surgeons and dermatopathologists in making more accurate decisions.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Multi-teacher Knowledge Distillation for Efficient General Image Forgery Detection and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) is of vital importance as forged images can spread misinformation that poses potential threats to our daily lives. However, previous methods still struggled to effectively handle forged images processed with diverse forgery operations in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel Reinforced Multi-teacher Knowledge Distillation (Re-MTKD) framework for the IFDL task, structured around an encoder-decoder \textbf{C}onvNeXt-\textbf{U}perNet along with \textbf{E}dge-Aware Module, named Cue-Net. First, three Cue-Net models are separately trained for the three main types of image forgeries, i.e., copy-move, splicing, and inpainting, which then serve as the multi-teacher models to train the target student model with Cue-Net through self-knowledge distillation. A Reinforced Dynamic Teacher Selection (Re-DTS) strategy is developed to dynamically assign weights to the involved teacher models, which facilitates specific knowledge transfer and enables the student model to effectively learn both the common and specific natures of diverse tampering traces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method achieves superior performance on several recently emerged datasets comprised of various kinds of image forgeries.</description>

      <title>A Reality Check of Vision-Language Pre-training in Radiology: Have We Progressed Using Text?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language pre-training has recently gained popularity as it allows learning rich feature representations using large-scale data sources. This paradigm has quickly made its way into the medical image analysis community. In particular, there is an impressive amount of recent literature developing vision-language models for radiology. However, the available medical datasets with image-text supervision are scarce, and medical concepts are fine-grained, involving expert knowledge that existing vision-language models struggle to encode. In this paper, we propose to take a prudent step back from the literature and revisit supervised, unimodal pre-training, using fine-grained labels instead. We conduct an extensive comparison demonstrating that unimodal pre-training is highly competitive and better suited to integrating heterogeneous data sources. Our results also question the potential of recent vision-language models for open-vocabulary generalization, which have been evaluated using optimistic experimental settings. Finally, we study novel alternatives to better integrate fine-grained labels and noisy text supervision.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning for Medical Image Classification: A Comprehensive Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The federated learning paradigm is wellsuited for the field of medical image analysis, as it can effectively cope with machine learning on isolated multicenter data while protecting the privacy of participating parties. However, current research on optimization algorithms in federated learning often focuses on limited datasets and scenarios, primarily centered around natural images, with insufficient comparative experiments in medical contexts. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms in the context of medical imaging. We conduct a fair comparison of classification models trained using various federated learning algorithms across multiple medical imaging datasets. Additionally, we evaluate system performance metrics, such as communication cost and computational efficiency, while considering different federated learning architectures. Our findings show that medical imaging datasets pose substantial challenges for current federated learning optimization algorithms. No single algorithm consistently delivers optimal performance across all medical federated learning scenarios, and many optimization algorithms may underperform when applied to these datasets. Our experiments provide a benchmark and guidance for future research and application of federated learning in medical imaging contexts. Furthermore, we propose an efficient and robust method that combines generative techniques using denoising diffusion probabilistic models with label smoothing to augment datasets, widely enhancing the performance of federated learning on classification tasks across various medical imaging datasets. Our code will be released on GitHub, offering a reliable and comprehensive benchmark for future federated learning studies in medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Texture2LoD3: Enabling LoD3 Building Reconstruction With Panoramic Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in surface reconstruction, Level of Detail (LoD) 3 building reconstruction remains an unresolved challenge. The main issue pertains to the object-oriented modelling paradigm, which requires georeferencing, watertight geometry, facade semantics, and low-poly representation -- Contrasting unstructured mesh-oriented models. In Texture2LoD3, we introduce a novel method leveraging the ubiquity of 3D building model priors and panoramic street-level images, enabling the reconstruction of LoD3 building models. We observe that prior low-detail building models can serve as valid planar targets for ortho-rectifying street-level panoramic images. Moreover, deploying segmentation on accurately textured low-level building surfaces supports maintaining essential georeferencing, watertight geometry, and low-poly representation for LoD3 reconstruction. In the absence of LoD3 validation data, we additionally introduce the ReLoD3 dataset, on which we experimentally demonstrate that our method leads to improved facade segmentation accuracy by 11% and can replace costly manual projections. We believe that Texture2LoD3 can scale the adoption of LoD3 models, opening applications in estimating building solar potential or enhancing autonomous driving simulations. The project website, code, and data are available here: https://wenzhaotang.github.io/Texture2LoD3/.</description>

      <title>Contour Integration Underlies Human-Like Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the tremendous success of deep learning in computer vision, models still fall behind humans in generalizing to new input distributions. Existing benchmarks do not investigate the specific failure points of models by analyzing performance under many controlled conditions. Our study systematically dissects where and why models struggle with contour integration -- a hallmark of human vision -- by designing an experiment that tests object recognition under various levels of object fragmentation. Humans (n=50) perform at high accuracy, even with few object contours present. This is in contrast to models which exhibit substantially lower sensitivity to increasing object contours, with most of the over 1,000 models we tested barely performing above chance. Only at very large scales ($\sim5B$ training dataset size) do models begin to approach human performance. Importantly, humans exhibit an integration bias -- a preference towards recognizing objects made up of directional fragments over directionless fragments. We find that not only do models that share this property perform better at our task, but that this bias also increases with model training dataset size, and training models to exhibit contour integration leads to high shape bias. Taken together, our results suggest that contour integration is a hallmark of object vision that underlies object recognition performance, and may be a mechanism learned from data at scale.</description>

      <title>Explaining Low Perception Model Competency with High-Competency Counterfactuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exist many methods to explain how an image classification model generates its decision, but very little work has explored methods to explain why a classifier might lack confidence in its prediction. As there are various reasons the classifier might lose confidence, it would be valuable for this model to not only indicate its level of uncertainty but also explain why it is uncertain. Counterfactual images have been used to visualize changes that could be made to an image to generate a different classification decision. In this work, we explore the use of counterfactuals to offer an explanation for low model competency--a generalized form of predictive uncertainty that measures confidence. Toward this end, we develop five novel methods to generate high-competency counterfactual images, namely Image Gradient Descent (IGD), Feature Gradient Descent (FGD), Autoencoder Reconstruction (Reco), Latent Gradient Descent (LGD), and Latent Nearest Neighbors (LNN). We evaluate these methods across two unique datasets containing images with six known causes for low model competency and find Reco, LGD, and LNN to be the most promising methods for counterfactual generation. We further evaluate how these three methods can be utilized by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate language explanations for low model competency. We find that the inclusion of a counterfactual image in the language model query greatly increases the ability of the model to generate an accurate explanation for the cause of low model competency, thus demonstrating the utility of counterfactual images in explaining low perception model competency.</description>

      <title>From Sparse Signal to Smooth Motion: Real-Time Motion Generation with Rolling Prediction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In extended reality (XR), generating full-body motion of the users is important to understand their actions, drive their virtual avatars for social interaction, and convey a realistic sense of presence. While prior works focused on spatially sparse and always-on input signals from motion controllers, many XR applications opt for vision-based hand tracking for reduced user friction and better immersion. Compared to controllers, hand tracking signals are less accurate and can even be missing for an extended period of time. To handle such unreliable inputs, we present Rolling Prediction Model (RPM), an online and real-time approach that generates smooth full-body motion from temporally and spatially sparse input signals. Our model generates 1) accurate motion that matches the inputs (i.e., tracking mode) and 2) plausible motion when inputs are missing (i.e., synthesis mode). More importantly, RPM generates seamless transitions from tracking to synthesis, and vice versa. To demonstrate the practical importance of handling noisy and missing inputs, we present GORP, the first dataset of realistic sparse inputs from a commercial virtual reality (VR) headset with paired high quality body motion ground truth. GORP provides &gt;14 hours of VR gameplay data from 28 people using motion controllers (spatially sparse) and hand tracking (spatially and temporally sparse). We benchmark RPM against the state of the art on both synthetic data and GORP to highlight how we can bridge the gap for real-world applications with a realistic dataset and by handling unreliable input signals. Our code, pretrained models, and GORP dataset are available in the project webpage.</description>

      <title>AnomalousNet: A Hybrid Approach with Attention U-Nets and Change Point Detection for Accurate Characterization of Anomalous Diffusion in Video Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous diffusion occurs in a wide range of systems, including protein transport within cells, animal movement in complex habitats, pollutant dispersion in groundwater, and nanoparticle motion in synthetic materials. Accurately estimating the anomalous diffusion exponent and the diffusion coefficient from the particle trajectories is essential to distinguish between sub-diffusive, super-diffusive, or normal diffusion regimes. These estimates provide a deeper insight into the underlying dynamics of the system, facilitating the identification of particle behaviors and the detection of changes in diffusion states. However, analyzing short and noisy video data, which often yield incomplete and heterogeneous trajectories, poses a significant challenge for traditional statistical approaches. We introduce a data-driven method that integrates particle tracking, an attention
  U-Net architecture, and a change-point detection algorithm to address these issues. This approach not only infers the anomalous diffusion parameters with high accuracy but also identifies temporal transitions between different states, even in the presence of noise and limited temporal resolution. Our methodology demonstrated strong performance in the 2nd Anomalous Diffusion (AnDi) Challenge benchmark within the top submissions for video tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce LiveVQA, an automatically collected dataset of latest visual knowledge from the Internet with synthesized VQA problems. LiveVQA consists of 3,602 single- and multi-hop visual questions from 6 news websites across 14 news categories, featuring high-quality image-text coherence and authentic information. Our evaluation across 15 MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemma-3, and Qwen-2.5-VL family) demonstrates that stronger models perform better overall, with advanced visual reasoning capabilities proving crucial for complex multi-hop questions. Despite excellent performance on textual problems, models with tools like search engines still show significant gaps when addressing visual questions requiring latest visual knowledge, highlighting important areas for future research.</description>

      <title>One-Minute Video Generation with Test-Time Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers today still struggle to generate one-minute videos because self-attention layers are inefficient for long context. Alternatives such as Mamba layers struggle with complex multi-scene stories because their hidden states are less expressive. We experiment with Test-Time Training (TTT) layers, whose hidden states themselves can be neural networks, therefore more expressive. Adding TTT layers into a pre-trained Transformer enables it to generate one-minute videos from text storyboards. For proof of concept, we curate a dataset based on Tom and Jerry cartoons. Compared to baselines such as Mamba~2, Gated DeltaNet, and sliding-window attention layers, TTT layers generate much more coherent videos that tell complex stories, leading by 34 Elo points in a human evaluation of 100 videos per method. Although promising, results still contain artifacts, likely due to the limited capability of the pre-trained 5B model. The efficiency of our implementation can also be improved. We have only experimented with one-minute videos due to resource constraints, but the approach can be extended to longer videos and more complex stories. Sample videos, code and annotations are available at: https://test-time-training.github.io/video-dit</description>

      <title>S^4M: Boosting Semi-Supervised Instance Segmentation with SAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised instance segmentation poses challenges due to limited labeled data, causing difficulties in accurately localizing distinct object instances. Current teacher-student frameworks still suffer from performance constraints due to unreliable pseudo-label quality stemming from limited labeled data. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers robust segmentation capabilities at various granularities, directly applying SAM to this task introduces challenges such as class-agnostic predictions and potential over-segmentation. To address these complexities, we carefully integrate SAM into the semi-supervised instance segmentation framework, developing a novel distillation method that effectively captures the precise localization capabilities of SAM without compromising semantic recognition. Furthermore, we incorporate pseudo-label refinement as well as a specialized data augmentation with the refined pseudo-labels, resulting in superior performance. We establish state-of-the-art performance, and provide comprehensive experiments and ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>InteractVLM: 3D Interaction Reasoning from 2D Foundational Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce InteractVLM, a novel method to estimate 3D contact points on human bodies and objects from single in-the-wild images, enabling accurate human-object joint reconstruction in 3D. This is challenging due to occlusions, depth ambiguities, and widely varying object shapes. Existing methods rely on 3D contact annotations collected via expensive motion-capture systems or tedious manual labeling, limiting scalability and generalization. To overcome this, InteractVLM harnesses the broad visual knowledge of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), fine-tuned with limited 3D contact data. However, directly applying these models is non-trivial, as they reason only in 2D, while human-object contact is inherently 3D. Thus we introduce a novel Render-Localize-Lift module that: (1) embeds 3D body and object surfaces in 2D space via multi-view rendering, (2) trains a novel multi-view localization model (MV-Loc) to infer contacts in 2D, and (3) lifts these to 3D. Additionally, we propose a new task called Semantic Human Contact estimation, where human contact predictions are conditioned explicitly on object semantics, enabling richer interaction modeling. InteractVLM outperforms existing work on contact estimation and also facilitates 3D reconstruction from an in-the wild image. Code and models are available at https://interactvlm.is.tue.mpg.de.</description>

      <title>URECA: Unique Region Caption Anything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Region-level captioning aims to generate natural language descriptions for specific image regions while highlighting their distinguishing features. However, existing methods struggle to produce unique captions across multi-granularity, limiting their real-world applicability. To address the need for detailed region-level understanding, we introduce URECA dataset, a large-scale dataset tailored for multi-granularity region captioning. Unlike prior datasets that focus primarily on salient objects, URECA dataset ensures a unique and consistent mapping between regions and captions by incorporating a diverse set of objects, parts, and background elements. Central to this is a stage-wise data curation pipeline, where each stage incrementally refines region selection and caption generation. By leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at each stage, our pipeline produces distinctive and contextually grounded captions with improved accuracy and semantic diversity. Building upon this dataset, we present URECA, a novel captioning model designed to effectively encode multi-granularity regions. URECA maintains essential spatial properties such as position and shape through simple yet impactful modifications to existing MLLMs, enabling fine-grained and semantically rich region descriptions. Our approach introduces dynamic mask modeling and a high-resolution mask encoder to enhance caption uniqueness. Experiments show that URECA achieves state-of-the-art performance on URECA dataset and generalizes well to existing region-level captioning benchmarks.</description>

      <title>CREA: A Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework for Creative Content Generation with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creativity in AI imagery remains a fundamental challenge, requiring not only the generation of visually compelling content but also the capacity to add novel, expressive, and artistically rich transformations to images. Unlike conventional editing tasks that rely on direct prompt-based modifications, creative image editing demands an autonomous, iterative approach that balances originality, coherence, and artistic intent. To address this, we introduce CREA, a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that mimics the human creative process. Our framework leverages a team of specialized AI agents who dynamically collaborate to conceptualize, generate, critique, and enhance images. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that CREA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diversity, semantic alignment, and creative transformation. By structuring creativity as a dynamic, agentic process, CREA redefines the intersection of AI and art, paving the way for autonomous AI-driven artistic exploration, generative design, and human-AI co-creation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce the task of creative editing.</description>

      <title>PointSplit: Towards On-device 3D Object Detection with Heterogeneous Low-power Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Running deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices has drawn significant attention due to its fast response, privacy preservation, and robust operation regardless of Internet connectivity. While these devices already cope with various intelligent tasks, the latest edge devices that are equipped with multiple types of low-power accelerators (i.e., both mobile GPU and NPU) can bring another opportunity; a task that used to be too heavy for an edge device in the single-accelerator world might become viable in the upcoming heterogeneous-accelerator world.To realize the potential in the context of 3D object detection, we identify several technical challenges and propose PointSplit, a novel 3D object detection framework for multi-accelerator edge devices that addresses the problems. Specifically, our PointSplit design includes (1) 2D semantics-aware biased point sampling, (2) parallelized 3D feature extraction, and (3) role-based group-wise quantization. We implement PointSplit on TensorFlow Lite and evaluate it on a customized hardware platform comprising both mobile GPU and EdgeTPU. Experimental results on representative RGB-D datasets, SUN RGB-D and Scannet V2, demonstrate that PointSplit on a multi-accelerator device is 24.7 times faster with similar accuracy compared to the full-precision, 2D-3D fusion-based 3D detector on a GPU-only device.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensor-based human activity recognition is a key technology for many human-centered intelligent applications. However, this research is still in its infancy and faces many unresolved challenges. To address these, we propose a comprehensive optimization process approach centered on multi-attention interaction. We first utilize unsupervised statistical feature-guided diffusion models for highly adaptive data enhancement, and introduce a novel network architecture-Multi-branch Spatiotemporal Interaction Network, which uses multi-branch features at different levels to effectively Sequential ), which uses multi-branch features at different levels to effectively Sequential spatio-temporal interaction to enhance the ability to mine advanced latent features. In addition, we adopt a multi-loss function fusion strategy in the training phase to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between batches to optimize the training results. Finally, we also conducted actual deployment on embedded devices to extensively test the practical feasibility of the proposed method in existing work. We conduct extensive testing on three public datasets, including ablation studies, comparisons of related work, and embedded deployments.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Attention Network for Interpretable ECG-based Heart Disease Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, underscoring the need for accurate as well as interpretable diagnostic machine learning tools. In this work, we investigate heart disease classification using electrocardiogram (ECG) data from two widely-utilized datasets: The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and the PTB-XL datasets. We adapt a hierarchical attention network (HAN), originally developed for text classification, into an ECG-based heart-disease classification task. Our adapted HAN incorporates two attention layers that focus on ECG data segments of varying sizes. We conduct a comparative analysis between our adapted HAN and a more sophisticated state-of-the-art architecture, featuring a network with convolution, attention, and transformer layers (CAT-Net). Our empirical evaluation encompasses multiple aspects including test accuracy (quantified by 0-1 loss); model complexity (measured by the number of model parameters); and interpretability (through attention map visualization). Our adapted HAN demonstrates comparable test accuracy with significant reductions in model complexity and enhanced interpretability analysis: For the MIT-BIH dataset, our adapted HAN achieves 98.55\% test accuracy compared to 99.14\% for CAT-Net, while reducing the number of model parameters by a factor of 15.6. For the PTB-XL dataset, our adapted HAN achieves a 19.3-fold reduction in model complexity compared to CAT-Net, with only a 5\% lower test accuracy. From an interpretability perspective, the significantly simpler architecture and the hierarchical nature of our adapted HAN model facilitate a more straightforward interpretability analysis based on visualizing attention weights. Building on this advantage, we conduct an interpretability analysis of our HAN that highlights the regions of the ECG signal most relevant to the model's decisions.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Propagation in XAI: A Comparison of Analytical and Empirical Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding uncertainty in Explainable AI (XAI) is crucial for building trust and ensuring reliable decision-making in Machine Learning models. This paper introduces a unified framework for quantifying and interpreting Uncertainty in XAI by defining a general explanation function $e_{\theta}(x, f)$ that captures the propagation of uncertainty from key sources: perturbations in input data and model parameters. By using both analytical and empirical estimates of explanation variance, we provide a systematic means of assessing the impact uncertainty on explanations. We illustrate the approach using a first-order uncertainty propagation as the analytical estimator. In a comprehensive evaluation across heterogeneous datasets, we compare analytical and empirical estimates of uncertainty propagation and evaluate their robustness. Extending previous work on inconsistencies in explanations, our experiments identify XAI methods that do not reliably capture and propagate uncertainty. Our findings underscore the importance of uncertainty-aware explanations in high-stakes applications and offer new insights into the limitations of current XAI methods. The code for the experiments can be found in our repository at https://github.com/TeodorChiaburu/UXAI</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become a foundational component in diffusion models, significantly influencing their capacity across a wide range of generative and discriminative tasks. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of attention within diffusion models, systematically analysing its roles, design patterns, and operations across different modalities and tasks. We propose a unified taxonomy that categorises attention-related modifications into parts according to the structural components they affect, offering a clear lens through which to understand their functional diversity.

      <title>Semi-Self Representation Learning for Crowdsourced WiFi Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WiFi fingerprint-based localization has been studied intensively. Point-based solutions rely on position annotations of WiFi fingerprints. Trajectory-based solutions, however, require end-position annotations of WiFi trajectories, where a WiFi trajectory is a multivariate time series of signal features. A trajectory dataset is much larger than a pointwise dataset as the number of potential trajectories in a field may grow exponentially with respect to the size of the field. This work presents a semi-self representation learning solution, where a large dataset $C$ of crowdsourced unlabeled WiFi trajectories can be automatically labeled by a much smaller dataset $\tilde C$ of labeled WiFi trajectories. The size of $\tilde C$ only needs to be proportional to the size of the physical field, while the unlabeled $C$ could be much larger. This is made possible through a novel ``cut-and-flip'' augmentation scheme based on the meet-in-the-middle paradigm. A two-stage learning consisting of trajectory embedding followed by endpoint embedding is proposed for the unlabeled $C$. Then the learned representations are labeled by $\tilde C$ and connected to a neural-based localization network. The result, while delivering promising accuracy, significantly relieves the burden of human annotations for trajectory-based localization.</description>

      <title>Improved visual-information-driven model for crowd simulation and its modular application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven crowd simulation models offer advantages in enhancing the accuracy and realism of simulations, and improving their generalizability is essential for promoting application. Current data-driven approaches are primarily designed for a single scenario, with very few models validated across more than two scenarios. It is still an open question to develop data-driven crowd simulation models with strong generalizibility. We notice that the key to addressing this challenge lies in effectively and accurately capturing the core common influential features that govern pedestrians' navigation across diverse scenarios. Particularly, we believe that visual information is one of the most dominant influencing features. In light of this, this paper proposes a data-driven model incorporating a refined visual information extraction method and exit cues to enhance generalizability. The proposed model is examined on four common fundamental modules: bottleneck, corridor, corner and T-junction. The evaluation results demonstrate that our model performs excellently across these scenarios, aligning with pedestrian movement in real-world experiments, and significantly outperforms the classical knowledge-driven model. Furthermore, we introduce a modular approach to apply our proposed model in composite scenarios, and the results regarding trajectories and fundamental diagrams indicate that our simulations closely match real-world patterns in the composite scenario. The research outcomes can provide inspiration for the development of data-driven crowd simulation models with high generalizability and advance the application of data-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>A Study on Adversarial Robustness of Discriminative Prototypical Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate significant vulnerability to adversarial perturbations, posing risks for critical applications. Current adversarial training methods predominantly focus on robustness against attacks without explicitly leveraging geometric structures in the latent space, usually resulting in reduced accuracy on the original clean data. To address these issues, we propose a novel adversarial training framework named Adversarial Deep Positive-Negative Prototypes (Adv-DPNP), which integrates disriminative prototype-based learning with adversarial training. Adv-DPNP uses unified class prototypes serving dual roles as classifier weights and robust anchors, enhancing both intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in the latent space. Moreover, a novel dual-branch training mechanism maintains stable prototypes by updating them exclusively with clean data; while the feature extractor layers are learned using both clean and adversarial data to remain invariant against adversarial perturbations. In addition, our approach utilizes a composite loss function combining positive prototype alignment, negative prototype repulsion, and consistency regularization to further enhance discrimination, adversarial robustness, and clean accuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on standard benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of Adv-DPNP compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher clean accuracy and competitive robustness under adversarial perturbations and common corruptions.

      <title>FAST: Federated Active Learning with Foundation Models for Communication-efficient Sampling and Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Active Learning (FAL) has emerged as a promising framework to leverage large quantities of unlabeled data across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, real-world deployments remain limited by high annotation costs and communication-intensive sampling processes, particularly in a cross-silo setting, when clients possess substantial local datasets. This paper addresses the crucial question: What is the best practice to reduce communication costs in human-in-the-loop learning with minimal annotator effort? Existing FAL methods typically rely on iterative annotation processes that separate active sampling from federated updates, leading to multiple rounds of expensive communication and annotation. In response, we introduce FAST, a two-pass FAL framework that harnesses foundation models for weak labeling in a preliminary pass, followed by a refinement pass focused exclusively on the most uncertain samples. By leveraging representation knowledge from foundation models and integrating refinement steps into a streamlined workflow, FAST substantially reduces the overhead incurred by iterative active sampling. Extensive experiments on diverse medical and natural image benchmarks demonstrate that FAST outperforms existing FAL methods by an average of 4.36% while reducing communication rounds eightfold under a limited 5% labeling budget.</description>

      <title>View2CAD: Reconstructing View-Centric CAD Models from Single RGB-D Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric CAD models, represented as Boundary Representations (B-reps), are foundational to modern design and manufacturing workflows, offering the precision and topological breakdown required for downstream tasks such as analysis, editing, and fabrication. However, B-Reps are often inaccessible due to conversion to more standardized, less expressive geometry formats. Existing methods to recover B-Reps from measured data require complete, noise-free 3D data, which are laborious to obtain. We alleviate this difficulty by enabling the precise reconstruction of CAD shapes from a single RGB-D image. We propose a method that addresses the challenge of reconstructing only the observed geometry from a single view. To allow for these partial observations, and to avoid hallucinating incorrect geometry, we introduce a novel view-centric B-rep (VB-Rep) representation, which incorporates structures to handle visibility limits and encode geometric uncertainty. We combine panoptic image segmentation with iterative geometric optimization to refine and improve the reconstruction process. Our results demonstrate high-quality reconstruction on synthetic and real RGB-D data, showing that our method can bridge the reality gap.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Deep Learning Models for Femur Segmentation in MRI Scan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks like U-Net excel in medical image segmentation, while attention mechanisms and KAN enhance feature extraction. Meta's SAM 2 uses Vision Transformers for prompt-based segmentation without fine-tuning. However, biases in these models impact generalization with limited data. In this study, we systematically evaluate and compare the performance of three CNN-based models, i.e., U-Net, Attention U-Net, and U-KAN, and one transformer-based model, i.e., SAM 2 for segmenting femur bone structures in MRI scan. The dataset comprises 11,164 MRI scans with detailed annotations of femoral regions. Performance is assessed using the Dice Similarity Coefficient, which ranges from 0.932 to 0.954. Attention U-Net achieves the highest overall scores, while U-KAN demonstrated superior performance in anatomical regions with a smaller region of interest, leveraging its enhanced learning capacity to improve segmentation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the Identity Mapping Problem in Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surge of deep learning has catalyzed considerable progress in self-supervised Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection (HAD). The core premise for self-supervised HAD is that anomalous pixels are inherently more challenging to reconstruct, resulting in larger errors compared to the background. However, owing to the powerful nonlinear fitting capabilities of neural networks, self-supervised models often suffer from the Identity Mapping Problem (IMP). The IMP manifests as a tendency for the model to overfit to the entire image, particularly with increasing network complexity or prolonged training iterations. Consequently, the whole image can be precisely reconstructed, and even the anomalous pixels exhibit imperceptible errors, making them difficult to detect. Despite the proposal of several models aimed at addressing the IMP-related issues, a unified descriptive framework and validation of solutions for IMP remain lacking. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth exploration to IMP, and summarize a unified framework that describes IMP from the perspective of network optimization, which encompasses three aspects: perturbation, reconstruction, and regularization. Correspondingly, we introduce three solutions: superpixel pooling and uppooling for perturbation, error-adaptive convolution for reconstruction, and online background pixel mining for regularization. With extensive experiments being conducted to validate the effectiveness, it is hoped that our work will provide valuable insights and inspire further research for self-supervised HAD.

      <title>Video4DGen: Enhancing Video and 4D Generation through Mutual Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of 4D (i.e., sequential 3D) generation opens up new possibilities for lifelike experiences in various applications, where users can explore dynamic objects or characters from any viewpoint. Meanwhile, video generative models are receiving particular attention given their ability to produce realistic and imaginative frames. These models are also observed to exhibit strong 3D consistency, indicating the potential to act as world simulators. In this work, we present Video4DGen, a novel framework that excels in generating 4D representations from single or multiple generated videos as well as generating 4D-guided videos. This framework is pivotal for creating high-fidelity virtual contents that maintain both spatial and temporal coherence. The 4D outputs generated by Video4DGen are represented using our proposed Dynamic Gaussian Surfels (DGS), which optimizes time-varying warping functions to transform Gaussian surfels (surface elements) from a static state to a dynamically warped state. We design warped-state geometric regularization and refinements on Gaussian surfels, to preserve the structural integrity and fine-grained appearance details. To perform 4D generation from multiple videos and capture representation across spatial, temporal, and pose dimensions, we design multi-video alignment, root pose optimization, and pose-guided frame sampling strategies. The leveraging of continuous warping fields also enables a precise depiction of pose, motion, and deformation over per-video frames. Further, to improve the overall fidelity from the observation of all camera poses, Video4DGen performs novel-view video generation guided by the 4D content, with the proposed confidence-filtered DGS to enhance the quality of generated sequences. With the ability of 4D and video generation, Video4DGen offers a powerful tool for applications in virtual reality, animation, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Learning about the Physical World through Analytic Concepts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reviewing the progress in artificial intelligence over the past decade, various significant advances (e.g. object detection, image generation, large language models) have enabled AI systems to produce more semantically meaningful outputs and achieve widespread adoption in internet scenarios. Nevertheless, AI systems still struggle when it comes to understanding and interacting with the physical world. This reveals an important issue: relying solely on semantic-level concepts learned from internet data (e.g. texts, images) to understand the physical world is far from sufficient -- machine intelligence currently lacks an effective way to learn about the physical world. This research introduces the idea of analytic concept -- representing the concepts related to the physical world through programs of mathematical procedures, providing machine intelligence a portal to perceive, reason about, and interact with the physical world. Except for detailing the design philosophy and providing guidelines for the application of analytic concepts, this research also introduce about the infrastructure that has been built around analytic concepts. I aim for my research to contribute to addressing these questions: What is a proper abstraction of general concepts in the physical world for machine intelligence? How to systematically integrate structured priors with neural networks to constrain AI systems to comply with physical laws?</description>

      <title>Autoregressive High-Order Finite Difference Modulo Imaging: High-Dynamic Range for Computer Vision Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High dynamic range (HDR) imaging is vital for capturing the full range of light tones in scenes, essential for computer vision tasks such as autonomous driving. Standard commercial imaging systems face limitations in capacity for well depth, and quantization precision, hindering their HDR capabilities. Modulo imaging, based on unlimited sampling (US) theory, addresses these limitations by using a modulo analog-to-digital approach that resets signals upon saturation, enabling estimation of pixel resets through neighboring pixel intensities. Despite the effectiveness of (US) algorithms in one-dimensional signals, their optimization problem for two-dimensional signals remains unclear. This work formulates the US framework as an autoregressive $\ell_2$ phase unwrapping problem, providing computationally efficient solutions in the discrete cosine domain jointly with a stride removal algorithm also based on spatial differences. By leveraging higher-order finite differences for two-dimensional images, our approach enhances HDR image reconstruction from modulo images, demonstrating its efficacy in improving object detection in autonomous driving scenes without retraining.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loss functions are at the heart of deep learning, shaping how models learn and perform across diverse tasks. They are used to quantify the difference between predicted outputs and ground truth labels, guiding the optimization process to minimize errors. Selecting the right loss function is critical, as it directly impacts model convergence, generalization, and overall performance across various applications, from computer vision to time series forecasting. This paper presents a comprehensive review of loss functions, covering fundamental metrics like Mean Squared Error and Cross-Entropy to advanced functions such as Adversarial and Diffusion losses. We explore their mathematical foundations, impact on model training, and strategic selection for various applications, including computer vision (Discriminative and generative), tabular data prediction, and time series forecasting. For each of these categories, we discuss the most used loss functions in the recent advancements of deep learning techniques. Also, this review explore the historical evolution, computational efficiency, and ongoing challenges in loss function design, underlining the need for more adaptive and robust solutions. Emphasis is placed on complex scenarios involving multi-modal data, class imbalances, and real-world constraints. Finally, we identify key future directions, advocating for loss functions that enhance interpretability, scalability, and generalization, leading to more effective and resilient deep learning models.</description>

      <title>LOGLO-FNO: Efficient Learning of Local and Global Features in Fourier Neural Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling high-frequency information is a critical challenge in scientific machine learning. For instance, fully turbulent flow simulations of Navier-Stokes equations at Reynolds numbers 3500 and above can generate high-frequency signals due to swirling fluid motions caused by eddies and vortices. Faithfully modeling such signals using neural networks depends on accurately reconstructing moderate to high frequencies. However, it has been well known that deep neural nets exhibit the so-called spectral bias toward learning low-frequency components. Meanwhile, Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as a popular class of data-driven models in recent years for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and for surrogate modeling in general. Although impressive results have been achieved on several PDE benchmark problems, FNOs often perform poorly in learning non-dominant frequencies characterized by local features. This limitation stems from the spectral bias inherent in neural networks and the explicit exclusion of high-frequency modes in FNOs and their variants. Therefore, to mitigate these issues and improve FNO's spectral learning capabilities to represent a broad range of frequency components, we propose two key architectural enhancements: (i) a parallel branch performing local spectral convolutions (ii) a high-frequency propagation module. Moreover, we propose a novel frequency-sensitive loss term based on radially binned spectral errors. This introduction of a parallel branch for local convolutions reduces number of trainable parameters by up to 50% while achieving the accuracy of baseline FNO that relies solely on global convolutions. Experiments on three challenging PDE problems in fluid mechanics and biological pattern formation, and the qualitative and spectral analysis of predictions show the effectiveness of our method over the state-of-the-art neural operator baselines.</description>

      <title>Variational Self-Supervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Variational Self-Supervised Learning (VSSL), a novel framework that combines variational inference with self-supervised learning to enable efficient, decoder-free representation learning. Unlike traditional VAEs that rely on input reconstruction via a decoder, VSSL symmetrically couples two encoders with Gaussian outputs. A momentum-updated teacher network defines a dynamic, data-dependent prior, while the student encoder produces an approximate posterior from augmented views. The reconstruction term in the ELBO is replaced with a cross-view denoising objective, preserving the analytical tractability of Gaussian KL divergence. We further introduce cosine-based formulations of KL and log-likelihood terms to enhance semantic alignment in high-dimensional latent spaces. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 show that VSSL achieves competitive or superior performance to leading self-supervised methods, including BYOL and MoCo V3. VSSL offers a scalable, probabilistically grounded approach to learning transferable representations without generative reconstruction, bridging the gap between variational modeling and modern self-supervised techniques.</description>

      <title>Data Scaling Laws for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicle (AV) stacks have traditionally relied on decomposed approaches, with separate modules handling perception, prediction, and planning. However, this design introduces information loss during inter-module communication, increases computational overhead, and can lead to compounding errors. To address these challenges, recent works have proposed architectures that integrate all components into an end-to-end differentiable model, enabling holistic system optimization. This shift emphasizes data engineering over software integration, offering the potential to enhance system performance by simply scaling up training resources. In this work, we evaluate the performance of a simple end-to-end driving architecture on internal driving datasets ranging in size from 16 to 8192 hours with both open-loop metrics and closed-loop simulations. Specifically, we investigate how much additional training data is needed to achieve a target performance gain, e.g., a 5% improvement in motion prediction accuracy. By understanding the relationship between model performance and training dataset size, we aim to provide insights for data-driven decision-making in autonomous driving development.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis Testing for Progressive Kernel Estimation and VCM Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying an appropriate radius for unbiased kernel estimation is crucial for the efficiency of radiance estimation. However, determining both the radius and unbiasedness still faces big challenges. In this paper, we first propose a statistical model of photon samples and associated contributions for progressive kernel estimation, under which the kernel estimation is unbiased if the null hypothesis of this statistical model stands. Then, we present a method to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis about the statistical population (i.e., photon samples) by the F-test in the Analysis of Variance. Hereby, we implement a progressive photon mapping (PPM) algorithm, wherein the kernel radius is determined by this hypothesis test for unbiased radiance estimation. Secondly, we propose VCM+, a reinforcement of Vertex Connection and Merging (VCM), and derive its theoretically unbiased formulation. VCM+ combines hypothesis testing-based PPM with bidirectional path tracing (BDPT) via multiple importance sampling (MIS), wherein our kernel radius can leverage the contributions from PPM and BDPT. We test our new algorithms, improved PPM and VCM+, on diverse scenarios with different lighting settings. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can alleviate light leaks and visual blur artifacts of prior radiance estimate algorithms. We also evaluate the asymptotic performance of our approach and observe an overall improvement over the baseline in all testing scenarios.</description>

      <title>CALF: A Conditionally Adaptive Loss Function to Mitigate Class-Imbalanced Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imbalanced datasets pose a considerable challenge in training deep learning (DL) models for medical diagnostics, particularly for segmentation tasks. Imbalance may be associated with annotation quality limited annotated datasets, rare cases, or small-scale regions of interest (ROIs). These conditions adversely affect model training and performance, leading to segmentation boundaries which deviate from the true ROIs. Traditional loss functions, such as Binary Cross Entropy, replicate annotation biases and limit model generalization. We propose a novel, statistically driven, conditionally adaptive loss function (CALF) tailored to accommodate the conditions of imbalanced datasets in DL training. It employs a data-driven methodology by estimating imbalance severity using statistical methods of skewness and kurtosis, then applies an appropriate transformation to balance the training dataset while preserving data heterogeneity. This transformative approach integrates a multifaceted process, encompassing preprocessing, dataset filtering, and dynamic loss selection to achieve optimal outcomes. We benchmark our method against conventional loss functions using qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Experiments using large-scale open-source datasets (i.e., UPENN-GBM, UCSF, LGG, and BraTS) validate our approach, demonstrating substantial segmentation improvements.

      <title>Active Learning with a Noisy Annotator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Learning (AL) aims to reduce annotation costs by strategically selecting the most informative samples for labeling. However, most active learning methods struggle in the low-budget regime where only a few labeled examples are available. This issue becomes even more pronounced when annotators provide noisy labels. A common AL approach for the low- and mid-budget regimes focuses on maximizing the coverage of the labeled set across the entire dataset. We propose a novel framework called Noise-Aware Active Sampling (NAS) that extends existing greedy, coverage-based active learning strategies to handle noisy annotations. NAS identifies regions that remain uncovered due to the selection of noisy representatives and enables resampling from these areas. We introduce a simple yet effective noise filtering approach suitable for the low-budget regime, which leverages the inner mechanism of NAS and can be applied for noise filtering before model training. On multiple computer vision benchmarks, including CIFAR100 and ImageNet subsets, NAS significantly improves performance for standard active learning methods across different noise types and rates.</description>

      <title>BrainMRDiff: A Diffusion Model for Anatomically Consistent Brain MRI Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate brain tumor diagnosis relies on the assessment of multiple Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences. However, in clinical practice, the acquisition of certain sequences may be affected by factors like motion artifacts or contrast agent contraindications, leading to suboptimal outcome, such as poor image quality. This can then affect image interpretation by radiologists. Synthesizing high quality MRI sequences has thus become a critical research focus. Though recent advancements in controllable generative AI have facilitated the synthesis of diagnostic quality MRI, ensuring anatomical accuracy remains a significant challenge. Preserving critical structural relationships between different anatomical regions is essential, as even minor structural or topological inconsistencies can compromise diagnostic validity. In this work, we propose BrainMRDiff, a novel topology-preserving, anatomy-guided diffusion model for synthesizing brain MRI, leveraging brain and tumor anatomies as conditioning inputs. To achieve this, we introduce two key modules: Tumor+Structure Aggregation (TSA) and Topology-Guided Anatomy Preservation (TGAP). TSA integrates diverse anatomical structures with tumor information, forming a comprehensive conditioning mechanism for the diffusion process. TGAP enforces topological consistency during reverse denoising diffusion process; both these modules ensure that the generated image respects anatomical integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMRDiff surpasses existing baselines, achieving performance improvements of 23.33% on the BraTS-AG dataset and 33.33% on the BraTS-Met dataset. Code will be made publicly available soon.</description>

      <title>DanceMosaic: High-Fidelity Dance Generation with Multimodal Editability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in dance generation have enabled automatic synthesis of 3D dance motions. However, existing methods still struggle to produce high-fidelity dance sequences that simultaneously deliver exceptional realism, precise dance-music synchronization, high motion diversity, and physical plausibility. Moreover, existing methods lack the flexibility to edit dance sequences according to diverse guidance signals, such as musical prompts, pose constraints, action labels, and genre descriptions, significantly restricting their creative utility and adaptability. Unlike the existing approaches, DanceMosaic enables fast and high-fidelity dance generation, while allowing multimodal motion editing. Specifically, we propose a multimodal masked motion model that fuses the text-to-motion model with music and pose adapters to learn probabilistic mapping from diverse guidance signals to high-quality dance motion sequences via progressive generative masking training. To further enhance the motion generation quality, we propose multimodal classifier-free guidance and inference-time optimization mechanism that further enforce the alignment between the generated motions and the multimodal guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art performance in dance generation, significantly advancing the quality and editability achieved by existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Here Comes the Explanation: A Shapley Perspective on Multi-contrast Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has been successfully applied to medical image segmentation, enabling accurate identification of regions of interest such as organs and lesions. This approach works effectively across diverse datasets, including those with single-image contrast, multi-contrast, and multimodal imaging data. To improve human understanding of these black-box models, there is a growing need for Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for model transparency and accountability. Previous research has primarily focused on post hoc pixel-level explanations, using methods gradient-based and perturbation-based apporaches. These methods rely on gradients or perturbations to explain model predictions. However, these pixel-level explanations often struggle with the complexity inherent in multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation tasks, and the sparsely distributed explanations have limited clinical relevance. In this study, we propose using contrast-level Shapley values to explain state-of-the-art models trained on standard metrics used in brain tumor segmentation. Our results demonstrate that Shapley analysis provides valuable insights into different models' behavior used for tumor segmentation. We demonstrated a bias for U-Net towards over-weighing T1-contrast and FLAIR, while Swin-UNETR provided a cross-contrast understanding with balanced Shapley distribution.</description>

      <title>Classification of ADHD and Healthy Children Using EEG Based Multi-Band Spatial Features Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children, characterized by difficulties in attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Early and accurate diagnosis of ADHD is critical for effective intervention and management. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have emerged as a non-invasive and efficient tool for ADHD detection due to their high temporal resolution and ability to capture neural dynamics. In this study, we propose a method for classifying ADHD and healthy children using EEG data from the benchmark dataset. There were 61 children with ADHD and 60 healthy children, both boys and girls, aged 7 to 12. The EEG signals, recorded from 19 channels, were processed to extract Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Spectral Entropy (SE) features across five frequency bands, resulting in a comprehensive 190-dimensional feature set. To evaluate the classification performance, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the RBF kernel demonstrated the best performance with a mean cross-validation accuracy of 99.2\% and a standard deviation of 0.0079, indicating high robustness and precision. These results highlight the potential of spatial features in conjunction with machine learning for accurately classifying ADHD using EEG data. This work contributes to developing non-invasive, data-driven tools for early diagnosis and assessment of ADHD in children.</description>

      <title>LagKV: Lag-Relative Information of the KV Cache Tells Which Tokens Are Important</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing size of the Key-Value (KV) cache during the Large Language Models long-context inference is the main obstacle for its balance between the deployment cost and task accuracy. To reduce the KV cache size in such scenarios, most previous efforts leveraged on the attention weight to evict non-critical cache tokens. But there is a trade-off in those methods, they usually require major modifiation of the inference infrastructure and significant computation overhead. Base on the fact that the Large Lanuage models are autoregresssive models, we propose {\it LagKV}, a KV allocation strategy only relying on straight forward comparison among KV themself. It is a totally attention free method which offers easy integration to the main stream inference platform and comparable performance comparing to other complicated KV compression methods. Results on LongBench and PasskeyRetrieval show that, our approach achieves nearly zero loss when the ratio is $2\times$ and $\approx 90\%$ of the original model performance for $8\times$. Especially in the 64-digit passkey retrieval task, our mehod outperforms the attention weight based method $H_2O$ over $60\%$ with same compression ratios. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/AI-Lab-China-Merchants-Bank/LagKV}.</description>

      <title>Vision Transformers with Autoencoders and Explainable AI for Cancer Patient Risk Stratification Using Whole Slide Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, necessitating accurate diagnosis and prognosis. Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) has become an integral part of clinical workflows with advancements in digital pathology. While various studies have utilized WSIs, their extracted features may not fully capture the most relevant pathological information, and their lack of interpretability limits clinical adoption.
  In this paper, we propose PATH-X, a framework that integrates Vision Transformers (ViT) and Autoencoders with SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to enhance model explainability for patient stratification and risk prediction using WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A representative image slice is selected from each WSI, and numerical feature embeddings are extracted using Google's pre-trained ViT. These features are then compressed via an autoencoder and used for unsupervised clustering and classification tasks. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis is applied to evaluate stratification into two and three risk groups. SHAP is used to identify key contributing features, which are mapped onto histopathological slices to provide spatial context.
  PATH-X demonstrates strong performance in breast and glioma cancers, where a sufficient number of WSIs enabled robust stratification. However, performance in lung cancer was limited due to data availability, emphasizing the need for larger datasets to enhance model reliability and clinical applicability.</description>

      <title>Explainability of AI Uncertainty: Application to Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation on MRI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) is essential in healthcare, particularly for high-stakes tasks like medical image segmentation. Explainable AI and uncertainty quantification significantly enhance AI reliability by addressing key attributes such as robustness, usability, and explainability. Despite extensive technical advances in uncertainty quantification for medical imaging, understanding the clinical informativeness and interpretability of uncertainty remains limited. This study introduces a novel framework to explain the potential sources of predictive uncertainty, specifically in cortical lesion segmentation in multiple sclerosis using deep ensembles. The proposed analysis shifts the focus from the uncertainty-error relationship towards relevant medical and engineering factors. Our findings reveal that instance-wise uncertainty is strongly related to lesion size, shape, and cortical involvement. Expert rater feedback confirms that similar factors impede annotator confidence. Evaluations conducted on two datasets (206 patients, almost 2000 lesions) under both in-domain and distribution-shift conditions highlight the utility of the framework in different scenarios.</description>

      <title>SMF: Template-free and Rig-free Animation Transfer using Kinetic Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Animation retargeting involves applying a sparse motion description (e.g., 2D/3D keypoint sequences) to a given character mesh to produce a semantically plausible and temporally coherent full-body motion. Existing approaches come with a mix of restrictions - they require annotated training data, assume access to template-based shape priors or artist-designed deformation rigs, suffer from limited generalization to unseen motion and/or shapes, or exhibit motion jitter. We propose Self-supervised Motion Fields (SMF) as a self-supervised framework that can be robustly trained with sparse motion representations, without requiring dataset specific annotations, templates, or rigs. At the heart of our method are Kinetic Codes, a novel autoencoder-based sparse motion encoding, that exposes a semantically rich latent space simplifying large-scale training. Our architecture comprises dedicated spatial and temporal gradient predictors, which are trained end-to-end. The resultant network, regularized by the Kinetic Codes's latent space, has good generalization across shapes and motions. We evaluated our method on unseen motion sampled from AMASS, D4D, Mixamo, and raw monocular video for animation transfer on various characters with varying shapes and topology. We report a new SoTA on the AMASS dataset in the context of generalization to unseen motion. Project webpage at https://motionfields.github.io/</description>

      <title>Embracing Dynamics: Dynamics-aware 4D Gaussian Splatting SLAM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology now has photorealistic mapping capabilities thanks to the real-time high-fidelity rendering capability of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). However, due to the static representation of scenes, current 3DGS-based SLAM encounters issues with pose drift and failure to reconstruct accurate maps in dynamic environments. To address this problem, we present D4DGS-SLAM, the first SLAM method based on 4DGS map representation for dynamic environments. By incorporating the temporal dimension into scene representation, D4DGS-SLAM enables high-quality reconstruction of dynamic scenes. Utilizing the dynamics-aware InfoModule, we can obtain the dynamics, visibility, and reliability of scene points, and filter stable static points for tracking accordingly. When optimizing Gaussian points, we apply different isotropic regularization terms to Gaussians with varying dynamic characteristics. Experimental results on real-world dynamic scene datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both camera pose tracking and map quality.</description>

While it facilitates seamless transitions in complex tasks, the strategies underlying its execution remain largely unexplored. Here, we introduce the first systematic taxonomy of self-handover, derived from manual annotation of over 12 hours of cooking activity performed by 21 participants. Our analysis reveals that self-handover is not merely a passive transition, but a highly coordinated action involving anticipatory adjustments by both hands. As a step toward automated analysis of human manipulation, we further demonstrate the feasibility of classifying self-handover types using a state-of-the-art vision-language model. These findings offer fresh insights into bimanual coordination, underscoring the role of self-handover in enabling smooth task transitions-an ability essential for adaptive dual-arm robotics.</description>

      <title>REWIND: Real-Time Egocentric Whole-Body Motion Diffusion with Exemplar-Based Identity Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present REWIND (Real-Time Egocentric Whole-Body Motion Diffusion), a one-step diffusion model for real-time, high-fidelity human motion estimation from egocentric image inputs. While an existing method for egocentric whole-body (i.e., body and hands) motion estimation is non-real-time and acausal due to diffusion-based iterative motion refinement to capture correlations between body and hand poses, REWIND operates in a fully causal and real-time manner. To enable real-time inference, we introduce (1) cascaded body-hand denoising diffusion, which effectively models the correlation between egocentric body and hand motions in a fast, feed-forward manner, and (2) diffusion distillation, which enables high-quality motion estimation with a single denoising step. Our denoising diffusion model is based on a modified Transformer architecture, designed to causally model output motions while enhancing generalizability to unseen motion lengths. Additionally, REWIND optionally supports identity-conditioned motion estimation when identity prior is available. To this end, we propose a novel identity conditioning method based on a small set of pose exemplars of the target identity, which further enhances motion estimation quality. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that REWIND significantly outperforms the existing baselines both with and without exemplar-based identity conditioning.</description>

      <title>CloSE: A Compact Shape- and Orientation-Agnostic Cloth State Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloth manipulation is a difficult problem mainly because of the non-rigid nature of cloth, which makes a good representation of deformation essential. We present a new representation for the deformation-state of clothes. First, we propose the dGLI disk representation, based on topological indices computed for segments on the edges of the cloth mesh border that are arranged on a circular grid. The heat-map of the dGLI disk uncovers patterns that correspond to features of the cloth state that are consistent for different shapes, sizes of positions of the cloth, like the corners and the fold locations. We then abstract these important features from the dGLI disk onto a circle, calling it the Cloth StatE representation (CloSE). This representation is compact, continuous, and general for different shapes. Finally, we show the strengths of this representation in two relevant applications: semantic labeling and high- and low-level planning.

      <title>Balancing Robustness and Efficiency in Embedded DNNs Through Activation Function Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-based embedded systems for safety-critical applications, such as aerospace and autonomous driving, must be robust to perturbations caused by soft errors. As transistor geometries shrink and voltages decrease, modern electronic devices become more susceptible to background radiation, increasing the concern about failures produced by soft errors. The resilience of deep neural networks (DNNs) to these errors depends not only on target device technology but also on model structure and the numerical representation and arithmetic precision of their parameters. Compression techniques like pruning and quantization, used to reduce memory footprint and computational complexity, alter both model structure and representation, affecting soft error robustness. In this regard, although often overlooked, the choice of activation functions (AFs) impacts not only accuracy and trainability but also compressibility and error resilience. This paper explores the use of bounded AFs to enhance robustness against parameter perturbations, while evaluating their effects on model accuracy, compressibility, and computational load with a technology-agnostic approach. We focus on encoder-decoder convolutional models developed for semantic segmentation of hyperspectral images with application to autonomous driving systems. Experiments are conducted on an AMD-Xilinx's KV260 SoM.</description>

      <title>Universal Lymph Node Detection in Multiparametric MRI with Selective Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust localization of lymph nodes (LNs) in multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) is critical for the assessment of lymphadenopathy. Radiologists routinely measure the size of LN to distinguish benign from malignant nodes, which would require subsequent cancer staging. Sizing is a cumbersome task compounded by the diverse appearances of LNs in mpMRI, which renders their measurement difficult. Furthermore, smaller and potentially metastatic LNs could be missed during a busy clinical day. To alleviate these imaging and workflow problems, we propose a pipeline to universally detect both benign and metastatic nodes in the body for their ensuing measurement. The recently proposed VFNet neural network was employed to identify LN in T2 fat suppressed and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) sequences acquired by various scanners with a variety of exam protocols. We also use a selective augmentation technique known as Intra-Label LISA (ILL) to diversify the input data samples the model sees during training, such that it improves its robustness during the evaluation phase. We achieved a sensitivity of $\sim$83\% with ILL vs. $\sim$80\% without ILL at 4 FP/vol. Compared with current LN detection approaches evaluated on mpMRI, we show a sensitivity improvement of $\sim$9\% at 4 FP/vol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes a cascading multimodal pipeline for high-resolution biodiversity mapping across Europe, integrating species distribution modeling, biodiversity indicators, and habitat classification. The proposed pipeline first predicts species compositions using a deep-SDM, a multimodal model trained on remote sensing, climate time series, and species occurrence data at 50x50m resolution. These predictions are then used to generate biodiversity indicator maps and classify habitats with Pl@ntBERT, a transformer-based LLM designed for species-to-habitat mapping. With this approach, continental-scale species distribution maps, biodiversity indicator maps, and habitat maps are produced, providing fine-grained ecological insights. Unlike traditional methods, this framework enables joint modeling of interspecies dependencies, bias-aware training with heterogeneous presence-absence data, and large-scale inference from multi-source remote sensing inputs.</description>

      <title>Let it Snow! Animating Static Gaussian Scenes With Dynamic Weather Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently enabled fast and photorealistic reconstruction of static 3D scenes. However, introducing dynamic elements that interact naturally with such static scenes remains challenging. Accordingly, we present a novel hybrid framework that combines Gaussian-particle representations for incorporating physically-based global weather effects into static 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes, correctly handling the interactions of dynamic elements with the static scene. We follow a three-stage process: we first map static 3D Gaussians to a particle-based representation. We then introduce dynamic particles and simulate their motion using the Material Point Method (MPM). Finally, we map the simulated particles back to the Gaussian domain while introducing appearance parameters tailored for specific effects. To correctly handle the interactions of dynamic elements with the static scene, we introduce specialized collision handling techniques. Our approach supports a variety of weather effects, including snowfall, rainfall, fog, and sandstorms, and can also support falling objects, all with physically plausible motion and appearance. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both visual quality and physical realism.</description>

      <title>SmolVLM: Redefining small and efficient multimodal models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) deliver exceptional performance but require significant computational resources, limiting their deployment on mobile and edge devices. Smaller VLMs typically mirror design choices of larger models, such as extensive image tokenization, leading to inefficient GPU memory usage and constrained practicality for on-device applications.
  We introduce SmolVLM, a series of compact multimodal models specifically engineered for resource-efficient inference. We systematically explore architectural configurations, tokenization strategies, and data curation optimized for low computational overhead. Through this, we identify key design choices that yield substantial performance gains on image and video tasks with minimal memory footprints.
  Our smallest model, SmolVLM-256M, uses less than 1GB GPU memory during inference and outperforms the 300-times larger Idefics-80B model, despite an 18-month development gap. Our largest model, at 2.2B parameters, rivals state-of-the-art VLMs consuming twice the GPU memory. SmolVLM models extend beyond static images, demonstrating robust video comprehension capabilities.
  Our results emphasize that strategic architectural optimizations, aggressive yet efficient tokenization, and carefully curated training data significantly enhance multimodal performance, facilitating practical, energy-efficient deployments at significantly smaller scales.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Mixture Flow Matching Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models approximate the denoising distribution as a Gaussian and predict its mean, whereas flow matching models reparameterize the Gaussian mean as flow velocity. However, they underperform in few-step sampling due to discretization error and tend to produce over-saturated colors under classifier-free guidance (CFG). To address these limitations, we propose a novel Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow) model: instead of predicting the mean, GMFlow predicts dynamic Gaussian mixture (GM) parameters to capture a multi-modal flow velocity distribution, which can be learned with a KL divergence loss. We demonstrate that GMFlow generalizes previous diffusion and flow matching models where a single Gaussian is learned with an $L_2$ denoising loss. For inference, we derive GM-SDE/ODE solvers that leverage analytic denoising distributions and velocity fields for precise few-step sampling. Furthermore, we introduce a novel probabilistic guidance scheme that mitigates the over-saturation issues of CFG and improves image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFlow consistently outperforms flow matching baselines in generation quality, achieving a Precision of 0.942 with only 6 sampling steps on ImageNet 256$\times$256.</description>

      <title>InceptionNeXt: When Inception Meets ConvNeXt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the long-range modeling ability of ViTs, large-kernel convolutions are widely studied and adopted recently to enlarge the receptive field and improve model performance, like the remarkable work ConvNeXt which employs 7x7 depthwise convolution. Although such depthwise operator only consumes a few FLOPs, it largely harms the model efficiency on powerful computing devices due to the high memory access costs. For example, ConvNeXt-T has similar FLOPs with ResNet-50 but only achieves ~60% throughputs when trained on A100 GPUs with full precision. Although reducing the kernel size of ConvNeXt can improve speed, it results in significant performance degradation, which poses a challenging problem: How to speed up large-kernel-based CNN models while preserving their performance. To tackle this issue, inspired by Inceptions, we propose to decompose large-kernel depthwise convolution into four parallel branches along channel dimension, i.e., small square kernel, two orthogonal band kernels, and an identity mapping. With this new Inception depthwise convolution, we build a series of networks, namely IncepitonNeXt, which not only enjoy high throughputs but also maintain competitive performance. For instance, InceptionNeXt-T achieves 1.6x higher training throughputs than ConvNeX-T, as well as attains 0.2% top-1 accuracy improvement on ImageNet-1K. We anticipate InceptionNeXt can serve as an economical baseline for future architecture design to reduce carbon footprint. Code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/inceptionnext.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a method that recovers the surface, materials, and illumination of a scene from its posed multi-view images. In contrast to prior work, it does not require any additional data and can handle glossy objects or bright lighting. It is a progressive inverse rendering approach, which consists of three stages. In the first stage, we reconstruct the scene radiance and signed distance function (SDF) with a novel regularization strategy for specular reflections. We propose to explain a pixel color using both surface and volume rendering jointly, which allows for handling complex view-dependent lighting effects for surface reconstruction. In the second stage, we distill light visibility and indirect illumination from the learned SDF and radiance field using learnable mapping functions. Finally, we design a method for estimating the ratio of incoming direct light reflected in a specular manner and use it to reconstruct the materials and direct illumination. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art in recovering surfaces, materials, and lighting without relying on any additional data.</description>

      <title>Autism Spectrum Disorder Classification with Interpretability in Children based on Structural MRI Features Extracted using Contrastive Variational Autoencoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly disabling mental disease that brings significant impairments of social interaction ability to the patients, making early screening and intervention of ASD critical. With the development of the machine learning and neuroimaging technology, extensive research has been conducted on machine classification of ASD based on structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (s-MRI). However, most studies involve with datasets where participants' age are above 5 and lack interpretability. In this paper, we propose a machine learning method for ASD classification in children with age range from 0.92 to 4.83 years, based on s-MRI features extracted using contrastive variational autoencoder (CVAE). 78 s-MRIs, collected from Shenzhen Children's Hospital, are used for training CVAE, which consists of both ASD-specific feature channel and common shared feature channel. The ASD participants represented by ASD-specific features can be easily discriminated from TC participants represented by the common shared features. In case of degraded predictive accuracy when data size is extremely small, a transfer learning strategy is proposed here as a potential solution. Finally, we conduct neuroanatomical interpretation based on the correlation between s-MRI features extracted from CVAE and surface area of different cortical regions, which discloses potential biomarkers that could help target treatments of ASD in the future.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of multi-object tracking (MOT) is to continuously track and identify objects detected in videos. Currently, most methods for multi-object tracking model the motion information and combine it with appearance information to determine and track objects. In this paper, unfalsified control is employed to address the ID-switch problem in multi-object tracking. We establish sequences of appearance information variations for the trajectories during the tracking process and design a detection and rectification module specifically for ID-switch detection and recovery. We also propose a simple and effective strategy to address the issue of ambiguous matching of appearance information during the data association process. Experimental results on publicly available MOT datasets demonstrate that the tracker exhibits excellent effectiveness and robustness in handling tracking errors caused by occlusions and rapid movements.</description>

      <title>ARC-NeRF: Area Ray Casting for Broader Unseen View Coverage in Few-shot Object Rendering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) have enhanced its capabilities for novel view synthesis, yet its reliance on dense multi-view training images poses a practical challenge, often leading to artifacts and a lack of fine object details. Addressing this, we propose ARC-NeRF, an effective regularization-based approach with a novel Area Ray Casting strategy. While the previous ray augmentation methods are limited to covering only a single unseen view per extra ray, our proposed Area Ray covers a broader range of unseen views with just a single ray and enables an adaptive high-frequency regularization based on target pixel photo-consistency. Moreover, we propose luminance consistency regularization, which enhances the consistency of relative luminance between the original and Area Ray, leading to more accurate object textures. The relative luminance, as a free lunch extra data easily derived from RGB images, can be effectively utilized in few-shot scenarios where available training data is limited. Our ARC-NeRF outperforms its baseline and achieves competitive results on multiple benchmarks with sharply rendered fine details.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Video generation (T2V) have achieved remarkable success in synthesizing high-quality general videos from textual descriptions. A largely overlooked problem in T2V is that existing models have not adequately encoded physical knowledge of the real world, thus generated videos tend to have limited motion and poor variations. In this paper, we propose \textbf{MagicTime}, a metamorphic time-lapse video generation model, which learns real-world physics knowledge from time-lapse videos and implements metamorphic generation. First, we design a MagicAdapter scheme to decouple spatial and temporal training, encode more physical knowledge from metamorphic videos, and transform pre-trained T2V models to generate metamorphic videos. Second, we introduce a Dynamic Frames Extraction strategy to adapt to metamorphic time-lapse videos, which have a wider variation range and cover dramatic object metamorphic processes, thus embodying more physical knowledge than general videos. Finally, we introduce a Magic Text-Encoder to improve the understanding of metamorphic video prompts. Furthermore, we create a time-lapse video-text dataset called \textbf{ChronoMagic}, specifically curated to unlock the metamorphic video generation ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of MagicTime for generating high-quality and dynamic metamorphic videos, suggesting time-lapse video generation is a promising path toward building metamorphic simulators of the physical world.

      <title>Do LLMs Understand Visual Anomalies? Uncovering LLM's Capabilities in Zero-shot Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are markedly proficient in deriving visual representations guided by natural language. Recent explorations have utilized LVLMs to tackle zero-shot visual anomaly detection (VAD) challenges by pairing images with textual descriptions indicative of normal and abnormal conditions, referred to as anomaly prompts. However, existing approaches depend on static anomaly prompts that are prone to cross-semantic ambiguity, and prioritize global image-level representations over crucial local pixel-level image-to-text alignment that is necessary for accurate anomaly localization. In this paper, we present ALFA, a training-free approach designed to address these challenges via a unified model. We propose a run-time prompt adaptation strategy, which first generates informative anomaly prompts to leverage the capabilities of a large language model (LLM). This strategy is enhanced by a contextual scoring mechanism for per-image anomaly prompt adaptation and cross-semantic ambiguity mitigation. We further introduce a novel fine-grained aligner to fuse local pixel-level semantics for precise anomaly localization, by projecting the image-text alignment from global to local semantic spaces. Extensive evaluations on MVTec and VisA datasets confirm ALFA's effectiveness in harnessing the language potential for zero-shot VAD, achieving significant PRO improvements of 12.1% on MVTec and 8.9% on VisA compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>6Img-to-3D: Few-Image Large-Scale Outdoor Driving Scene Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current 3D reconstruction techniques struggle to infer unbounded scenes from a few images faithfully. Specifically, existing methods have high computational demands, require detailed pose information, and cannot reconstruct occluded regions reliably. We introduce 6Img-to-3D, an efficient, scalable transformer-based encoder-renderer method for single-shot image to 3D reconstruction. Our method outputs a 3D-consistent parameterized triplane from only six outward-facing input images for large-scale, unbounded outdoor driving scenarios. We take a step towards resolving existing shortcomings by combining contracted custom cross- and self-attention mechanisms for triplane parameterization, differentiable volume rendering, scene contraction, and image feature projection. We showcase that six surround-view vehicle images from a single timestamp without global pose information are enough to reconstruct 360$^{\circ}$ scenes during inference time, taking 395 ms. Our method allows, for example, rendering third-person images and birds-eye views. Our code is available at https://github.com/continental/6Img-to-3D, and more examples can be found at our website here https://6Img-to-3D.GitHub.io/.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding the Robustness of Diffusion-Based Purification: A Stochastic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion-Based Purification (DBP) has emerged as an effective defense mechanism against adversarial attacks. The success of DBP is often attributed to the forward diffusion process, which reduces the distribution gap between clean and adversarial images by adding Gaussian noise. While this explanation is theoretically sound, the exact role of this mechanism in enhancing robustness remains unclear. In this paper, through empirical analysis, we propose that the intrinsic stochasticity in the DBP process is the primary factor driving robustness. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a novel Deterministic White-Box (DW-box) setting to assess robustness in the absence of stochasticity, and we analyze attack trajectories and loss landscapes. Our results suggest that DBP models primarily rely on stochasticity to avoid effective attack directions, while their ability to purify adversarial perturbations may be limited. To further enhance the robustness of DBP models, we propose Adversarial Denoising Diffusion Training (ADDT), which incorporates classifier-guided adversarial perturbations into the diffusion training process, thereby strengthening the models' ability to purify adversarial perturbations. Additionally, we propose Rank-Based Gaussian Mapping (RBGM) to improve the compatibility of perturbations with diffusion models. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of ADDT. In conclusion, our study suggests that future research on DBP can benefit from a clearer distinction between stochasticity-driven and purification-driven robustness.</description>

      <title>Removing Reflections from RAW Photos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a system to remove real-world reflections from images for consumer photography. Our system operates on linear (RAW) photos, and accepts an optional contextual photo looking in the opposite direction (e.g., the "selfie" camera on a mobile device). This optional photo disambiguates what should be considered the reflection. The system is trained solely on synthetic mixtures of real RAW photos, which we combine using a reflection simulation that is photometrically and geometrically accurate. Our system comprises a base model that accepts the captured photo and optional context photo as input, and runs at 256p, followed by an up-sampling model that transforms 256p images to full resolution. The system produces preview images at 1K in 4.5-6.5s on a MacBook or iPhone 14 Pro. We show SOTA results on RAW photos that were captured in the field to embody typical consumer photos, and show that training on RAW simulation data improves performance more than the architectural variations among prior works.</description>

      <title>CFPFormer: Feature-pyramid like Transformer Decoder for Segmentation and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature pyramids have been widely adopted in convolutional neural networks and transformers for tasks in medical image segmentation. However, existing models generally focus on the Encoder-side Transformer for feature extraction. We further explore the potential in improving the feature decoder with a well-designed architecture. We propose Cross Feature Pyramid Transformer decoder (CFPFormer), a novel decoder block that integrates feature pyramids and transformers. Even though transformer-like architecture impress with outstanding performance in segmentation, the concerns to reduce the redundancy and training costs still exist. Specifically, by leveraging patch embedding, cross-layer feature concatenation mechanisms, CFPFormer enhances feature extraction capabilities while complexity issue is mitigated by our Gaussian Attention. Benefiting from Transformer structure and U-shaped connections, our work is capable of capturing long-range dependencies and effectively up-sample feature maps. Experimental results are provided to evaluate CFPFormer on medical image segmentation datasets, demonstrating the efficacy and effectiveness. With a ResNet50 backbone, our method achieves 92.02\% Dice Score, highlighting the efficacy of our methods. Notably, our VGG-based model outperformed baselines with more complex ViT and Swin Transformer backbone.</description>

      <title>LeanGaussian: Breaking Pixel or Point Cloud Correspondence in Modeling 3D Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Gaussian splatting has demonstrated significant success in novel view synthesis. Current methods often regress Gaussians with pixel or point cloud correspondence, linking each Gaussian with a pixel or a 3D point. This leads to the redundancy of Gaussians being used to overfit the correspondence rather than the objects represented by the 3D Gaussians themselves, consequently wasting resources and lacking accurate geometries or textures. In this paper, we introduce LeanGaussian, a novel approach that treats each query in deformable Transformer as one 3D Gaussian ellipsoid, breaking the pixel or point cloud correspondence constraints. We leverage deformable decoder to iteratively refine the Gaussians layer-by-layer with the image features as keys and values. Notably, the center of each 3D Gaussian is defined as 3D reference points, which are then projected onto the image for deformable attention in 2D space. On both the ShapeNet SRN dataset (category level) and the Google Scanned Objects dataset (open-category level, trained with the Objaverse dataset), our approach, outperforms prior methods by approximately 6.1%, achieving a PSNR of 25.44 and 22.36, respectively. Additionally, our method achieves a 3D reconstruction speed of 7.2 FPS and rendering speed 500 FPS. Codes are available at https://github.com/jwubz123/LeanGaussian.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Personalized Content Synthesis with Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly impacted content creation, leading to the emergence of Personalized Content Synthesis (PCS). By utilizing a small set of user-provided examples featuring the same subject, PCS aims to tailor this subject to specific user-defined prompts. Over the past two years, more than 150 methods have been introduced in this area. However, existing surveys primarily focus on text-to-image generation, with few providing up-to-date summaries on PCS. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of PCS, introducing the general frameworks of PCS research, which can be categorized into test-time fine-tuning (TTF) and pre-trained adaptation (PTA) approaches. We analyze the strengths, limitations, and key techniques of these methodologies. Additionally, we explore specialized tasks within the field, such as object, face, and style personalization, while highlighting their unique challenges and innovations. Despite the promising progress, we also discuss ongoing challenges, including overfitting and the trade-off between subject fidelity and text alignment. Through this detailed overview and analysis, we propose future directions to further the development of PCS.</description>

      <title>Semantic Contextualization of Face Forgery: A New Definition, Dataset, and Detection Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has greatly streamlined the process of manipulating photographic face images. Aware of the potential dangers, researchers have developed various tools to spot these counterfeits. Yet, none asks the fundamental question: What digital manipulations make a real photographic face image fake, while others do not? In this paper, we put face forgery in a semantic context and define that computational methods that alter semantic face attributes to exceed human discrimination thresholds are sources of face forgery. Following our definition, we construct a large face forgery image dataset, where each image is associated with a set of labels organized in a hierarchical graph. Our dataset enables two new testing protocols to probe the generalizability of face forgery detectors. Moreover, we propose a semantics-oriented face forgery detection method that captures label relations and prioritizes the primary task (i.e., real or fake face detection). We show that the proposed dataset successfully exposes the weaknesses of current detectors as the test set and consistently improves their generalizability as the training set. Additionally, we demonstrate the superiority of our semantics-oriented method over traditional binary and multi-class classification-based detectors.</description>

      <title>TerDiT: Ternary Diffusion Models with Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in large-scale pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the generation of high-fidelity images, particularly with the emergence of diffusion transformer models (DiTs). Among diffusion models, diffusion transformers have demonstrated superior image-generation capabilities, boosting lower FID scores and higher scalability. However, deploying large-scale DiT models can be expensive due to their excessive parameter numbers. Although existing research has explored efficient deployment techniques for diffusion models, such as model quantization, there is still little work concerning DiT-based models. To tackle this research gap, we propose TerDiT, the first quantization-aware training (QAT) and efficient deployment scheme for extremely low-bit diffusion transformer models. We focus on the ternarization of DiT networks, with model sizes ranging from 600M to 4.2B, and image resolution from 256$\times$256 to 512$\times$512. Our work contributes to the exploration of efficient deployment of large-scale DiT models, demonstrating the feasibility of training extremely low-bit DiT models from scratch while maintaining competitive image generation capacities compared to full-precision models. Our code and pre-trained TerDiT checkpoints have been released at https://github.com/Lucky-Lance/TerDiT.</description>

      <title>Latent Intrinsics Emerge from Training to Relight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image relighting is the task of showing what a scene from a source image would look like if illuminated differently. Inverse graphics schemes recover an explicit representation of geometry and a set of chosen intrinsics, then relight with some form of renderer. However error control for inverse graphics is difficult, and inverse graphics methods can represent only the effects of the chosen intrinsics. This paper describes a relighting method that is entirely data-driven, where intrinsics and lighting are each represented as latent variables. Our approach produces SOTA relightings of real scenes, as measured by standard metrics. We show that albedo can be recovered from our latent intrinsics without using any example albedos, and that the albedos recovered are competitive with SOTA methods.</description>

      <title>Details Enhancement in Unsigned Distance Field Learning for High-fidelity 3D Surface Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Signed Distance Fields (SDF) are well-established for modeling watertight surfaces, Unsigned Distance Fields (UDF) broaden the scope to include open surfaces and models with complex inner structures. Despite their flexibility, UDFs encounter significant challenges in high-fidelity 3D reconstruction, such as non-differentiability at the zero level set, difficulty in achieving the exact zero value, numerous local minima, vanishing gradients, and oscillating gradient directions near the zero level set. To address these challenges, we propose Details Enhanced UDF (DEUDF) learning that integrates normal alignment and the SIREN network for capturing fine geometric details, adaptively weighted Eikonal constraints to address vanishing gradients near the target surface, unconditioned MLP-based UDF representation to relax non-negativity constraints, and DCUDF for extracting the local minimal average distance surface. These strategies collectively stabilize the learning process from unoriented point clouds and enhance the accuracy of UDFs. Our computational results demonstrate that DEUDF outperforms existing UDF learning methods in both accuracy and the quality of reconstructed surfaces.

      <title>Enhancing Temporal Consistency in Video Editing by Reconstructing Videos with 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02541v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in zero-shot video diffusion models have shown promise for text-driven video editing, but challenges remain in achieving high temporal consistency. To address this, we introduce Video-3DGS, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based video refiner designed to enhance temporal consistency in zero-shot video editors. Our approach utilizes a two-stage 3D Gaussian optimizing process tailored for editing dynamic monocular videos. In the first stage, Video-3DGS employs an improved version of COLMAP, referred to as MC-COLMAP, which processes original videos using a Masked and Clipped approach. For each video clip, MC-COLMAP generates the point clouds for dynamic foreground objects and complex backgrounds. These point clouds are utilized to initialize two sets of 3D Gaussians (Frg-3DGS and Bkg-3DGS) aiming to represent foreground and background views. Both foreground and background views are then merged with a 2D learnable parameter map to reconstruct full views. In the second stage, we leverage the reconstruction ability developed in the first stage to impose the temporal constraints on the video diffusion model. To demonstrate the efficacy of Video-3DGS on both stages, we conduct extensive experiments across two related tasks: Video Reconstruction and Video Editing. Video-3DGS trained with 3k iterations significantly improves video reconstruction quality (+3 PSNR, +7 PSNR increase) and training efficiency (x1.9, x4.5 times faster) over NeRF-based and 3DGS-based state-of-art methods on DAVIS dataset, respectively. Moreover, it enhances video editing by ensuring temporal consistency across 58 dynamic monocular videos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate estimates of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) are essential in addressing two of humanity's biggest challenges: climate change and biodiversity loss. Existing datasets for AGB estimation from satellite imagery are limited. Either they focus on specific, local regions at high resolution, or they offer global coverage at low resolution. There is a need for a machine learning-ready, globally representative, high-resolution benchmark dataset. Our findings indicate significant variability in biomass estimates across different vegetation types, emphasizing the necessity for a dataset that accurately captures global diversity. To address these gaps, we introduce a comprehensive new dataset that is globally distributed, covers a range of vegetation types, and spans several years. This dataset combines AGB reference data from the GEDI mission with data from Sentinel-2 and PALSAR-2 imagery. Additionally, it includes pre-processed high-level features such as a dense canopy height map, an elevation map, and a land-cover classification map. We also produce a dense, high-resolution (10m) map of AGB predictions for the entire area covered by the dataset. Rigorously tested, our dataset is accompanied by several benchmark models and is publicly available. It can be easily accessed using a single line of code, offering a solid basis for efforts towards global AGB estimation. The GitHub repository github.com/ghjuliasialelli/AGBD serves as a one-stop shop for all code and data.</description>

Structured representations allow modeling of individual objects distinctly and their flexible use based on the task context for both scene-level and object-specific tasks. These capabilities play a central role in human reasoning and generalization, allowing us to abstract away irrelevant details and focus on relevant information in a compact and usable form. We define structured representations as those that adhere to two specific properties: binding specific object information into discrete representation units and segregating object representations into separate sets of tokens to minimize cross-object entanglement. Based on these properties, we evaluated and compared image encoders pre-trained on classification (ViT), large vision-language models (CLIP, BLIP, FLAVA), and self-supervised methods (DINO, DINOv2). We examine the token representations by creating object-decoding tasks that measure the ability of specific tokens to capture individual objects in multi-object scenes from the COCO dataset. This analysis provides insights into how object-wise representations are distributed across tokens and layers within these vision encoders. Our findings highlight significant differences in the representation of objects depending on their relevance to the pre-training objective, with this effect particularly pronounced in the CLS token (often used for downstream tasks). Meanwhile, networks and layers that exhibit more structured representations retain better information about individual objects. To guide practical applications, we propose formal measures to quantify the two properties of structured representations, aiding in selecting and adapting vision encoders for downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the Human-Robot Domain Discrepancy in Visual Pre-training for Robotic Manipulation</title>

Abstract: Learning generalizable visual representations across different embodied environments is essential for effective robotic manipulation in real-world scenarios. However, the limited scale and diversity of robot demonstration data pose a significant challenge. Recent research has explored leveraging large-scale human activity data for pre-training, but the substantial morphological differences between humans and robots introduce a significant human-robot domain discrepancy, hindering the generalization of these models to downstream manipulation tasks. To overcome this, we propose a novel adaptation paradigm that leverages readily available paired human-robot video data to bridge the domain gap. Our method employs a human-robot contrastive alignment loss to align the semantics of human and robot videos, adapting pre-trained models to the robot domain in a parameter-efficient manner. Experiments on 20 simulated tasks across two different benchmarks and five real-world tasks demonstrate significant improvements. These results span both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task settings, evaluated using two different pre-trained models. Compared to existing pre-trained models, our adaptation method improves the average success rate by over 7% across multiple tasks on both simulated benchmarks and real-world evaluations.</description>

Abstract: Existing neural head avatars methods have achieved significant progress in the image quality and motion range of portrait animation. However, these methods neglect the computational overhead, and to the best of our knowledge, none is designed to run on mobile devices. This paper presents MobilePortrait, a lightweight one-shot neural head avatars method that reduces learning complexity by integrating external knowledge into both the motion modeling and image synthesis, enabling real-time inference on mobile devices. Specifically, we introduce a mixed representation of explicit and implicit keypoints for precise motion modeling and precomputed visual features for enhanced foreground and background synthesis. With these two key designs and using simple U-Nets as backbones, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with less than one-tenth the computational demand. It has been validated to reach speeds of over 100 FPS on mobile devices and support both video and audio-driven inputs.</description>

      <title>Learning Spatial-Semantic Features for Robust Video Object Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tracking and segmenting multiple similar objects with distinct or complex parts in long-term videos is particularly challenging due to the ambiguity in identifying target components and the confusion caused by occlusion, background clutter, and changes in appearance or environment over time. In this paper, we propose a robust video object segmentation framework that learns spatial-semantic features and discriminative object queries to address the above issues. Specifically, we construct a spatial-semantic block comprising a semantic embedding component and a spatial dependency modeling part for associating global semantic features and local spatial features, providing a comprehensive target representation. In addition, we develop a masked cross-attention module to generate object queries that focus on the most discriminative parts of target objects during query propagation, alleviating noise accumulation to ensure effective long-term query propagation. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark data sets, including the DAVIS2017 test (\textbf{87.8\%}), YoutubeVOS 2019 (\textbf{88.1\%}), MOSE val (\textbf{74.0\%}), and LVOS test (\textbf{73.0\%}), and demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capacity of our model.

      <title>Unsupervised 3D Point Cloud Completion via Multi-view Adversarial Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, scanned point clouds are often incomplete due to occlusion issues. The tasks of self-supervised and weakly-supervised point cloud completion involve reconstructing missing regions of these incomplete objects without the supervision of complete ground truth. Current methods either rely on multiple views of partial observations for supervision or overlook the intrinsic geometric similarity that can be identified and utilized from the given partial point clouds. In this paper, we propose MAL-UPC, a framework that effectively leverages both region-level and category-specific geometric similarities to complete missing structures. Our MAL-UPC does not require any 3D complete supervision and only necessitates single-view partial observations in the training set. Specifically, we first introduce a Pattern Retrieval Network to retrieve similar position and curvature patterns between the partial input and the predicted shape, then leverage these similarities to densify and refine the reconstructed results. Additionally, we render the reconstructed complete shape into multi-view depth maps and design an adversarial learning module to learn the geometry of the target shape from category-specific single-view depth images of the partial point clouds in the training set. To achieve anisotropic rendering, we design a density-aware radius estimation algorithm to improve the quality of the rendered images. Our MAL-UPC outperforms current state-of-the-art self-supervised methods and even some unpaired approaches. We will make the source code publicly available at https://github.com/ltwu6/malspc</description>

      <title>No Re-Train, More Gain: Upgrading Backbones with Diffusion model for Pixel-Wise and Weakly-Supervised Few-Shot Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes using only a few annotated images. Despite considerable progress under pixel-wise support annotation, current FSS methods still face three issues: the inflexibility of backbone upgrade without re-training, the inability to uniformly handle various types of annotations (e.g., scribble, bounding box, mask, and text), and the difficulty in accommodating different annotation quantity. To address these issues simultaneously, we propose DiffUp, a novel framework that conceptualizes the FSS task as a conditional generative problem using a diffusion process. For the first issue, we introduce a backbone-agnostic feature transformation module that converts different segmentation cues into unified coarse priors, facilitating seamless backbone upgrade without re-training. For the second issue, due to the varying granularity of transformed priors from diverse annotation types (scribble, bounding box, mask, and text), we conceptualize these multi-granular transformed priors as analogous to noisy intermediates at different steps of a diffusion model. This is implemented via a self-conditioned modulation block coupled with a dual-level quality modulation branch. For the third issue, we incorporate an uncertainty-aware information fusion module to harmonize the variability across zero-shot, one-shot, and many-shot scenarios. Evaluated through rigorous benchmarks, DiffUp significantly outperforms existing FSS models in terms of flexibility and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Edge Detection by Texture Handling Architecture and Noiseless Training Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19992v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image edge detection (ED) is a fundamental task in computer vision. While convolution-based models have significantly advanced ED performance, achieving high precision under strict error tolerance constraints remains challenging. Furthermore, the reliance on noisy, human-annotated training data limits model performance, even when the inputs are edge maps themselves. In this paper, we address these challenges in two key aspects. First, we propose a novel ED model incorporating Cascaded Skipping Density Blocks (CSDB) to enhance precision and robustness. Our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, with substantial improvements in average precision (AP), as demonstrated by extensive experiments. Second, we introduce a novel data augmentation strategy that enables the integration of noiseless annotations during training, improving model performance, particularly when processing edge maps directly. Our findings contribute to a more precise ED architecture and the first method for integrating noiseless training data into ED tasks, offering potential directions for improving ED models.

      <title>A Survey and Evaluation of Adversarial Attacks for Object Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01934v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning models achieve remarkable accuracy in computer vision tasks, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial examples--carefully crafted perturbations to input images that can deceive these models into making confident but incorrect predictions. This vulnerability pose significant risks in high-stakes applications such as autonomous vehicles, security surveillance, and safety-critical inspection systems. While the existing literature extensively covers adversarial attacks in image classification, comprehensive analyses of such attacks on object detection systems remain limited. This paper presents a novel taxonomic framework for categorizing adversarial attacks specific to object detection architectures, synthesizes existing robustness metrics, and provides a comprehensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art attack methodologies on popular object detection models, including both traditional detectors and modern detectors with vision-language pretraining. Through rigorous analysis of open-source attack implementations and their effectiveness across diverse detection architectures, we derive key insights into attack characteristics. Furthermore, we delineate critical research gaps and emerging challenges to guide future investigations in securing object detection systems against adversarial threats. Our findings establish a foundation for developing more robust detection models while highlighting the urgent need for standardized evaluation protocols in this rapidly evolving domain.</description>

      <title>Latent Feature and Attention Dual Erasure Attack against Multi-View Diffusion Models for 3D Assets Protection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-View Diffusion Models (MVDMs) enable remarkable improvements in the field of 3D geometric reconstruction, but the issue regarding intellectual property has received increasing attention due to unauthorized imitation. Recently, some works have utilized adversarial attacks to protect copyright. However, all these works focus on single-image generation tasks which only need to consider the inner feature of images. Previous methods are inefficient in attacking MVDMs because they lack the consideration of disrupting the geometric and visual consistency among the generated multi-view images. This paper is the first to address the intellectual property infringement issue arising from MVDMs. Accordingly, we propose a novel latent feature and attention dual erasure attack to disrupt the distribution of latent feature and the consistency across the generated images from multi-view and multi-domain simultaneously. The experiments conducted on SOTA MVDMs indicate that our approach achieves superior performances in terms of attack effectiveness, transferability, and robustness against defense methods. Therefore, this paper provides an efficient solution to protect 3D assets from MVDMs-based 3D geometry reconstruction.</description>

      <title>MSCPT: Few-shot Whole Slide Image Classification with Multi-scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become a standard paradigm for the weakly supervised classification of whole slide images (WSIs). However, this paradigm relies on using a large number of labeled WSIs for training. The lack of training data and the presence of rare diseases pose significant challenges for these methods. Prompt tuning combined with pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) is an effective solution to the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI Classification (FSWC) task. Nevertheless, applying prompt tuning methods designed for natural images to WSIs presents three significant challenges: 1) These methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge from the VLM's text modality; 2) They overlook the essential multi-scale and contextual information in WSIs, leading to suboptimal results; and 3) They lack exploration of instance aggregation methods. To address these problems, we propose a Multi-Scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning (MSCPT) method for FSWC task. Specifically, MSCPT employs the frozen large language model to generate pathological visual language prior knowledge at multiple scales, guiding hierarchical prompt tuning. Additionally, we design a graph prompt tuning module to learn essential contextual information within WSI, and finally, a non-parametric cross-guided instance aggregation module has been introduced to derive the WSI-level features. Extensive experiments, visualizations, and interpretability analyses were conducted on five datasets and three downstream tasks using three VLMs, demonstrating the strong performance of our MSCPT. All codes have been made publicly accessible at https://github.com/Hanminghao/MSCPT.</description>

      <title>FRAP: Faithful and Realistic Text-to-Image Generation with Adaptive Prompt Weighting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality images given a text prompt. However, ensuring the prompt-image alignment remains a considerable challenge, i.e., generating images that faithfully align with the prompt's semantics. Recent works attempt to improve the faithfulness by optimizing the latent code, which potentially could cause the latent code to go out-of-distribution and thus produce unrealistic images. In this paper, we propose FRAP, a simple, yet effective approach based on adaptively adjusting the per-token prompt weights to improve prompt-image alignment and authenticity of the generated images. We design an online algorithm to adaptively update each token's weight coefficient, which is achieved by minimizing a unified objective function that encourages object presence and the binding of object-modifier pairs. Through extensive evaluations, we show FRAP generates images with significantly higher prompt-image alignment to prompts from complex datasets, while having a lower average latency compared to recent latent code optimization methods, e.g., 4 seconds faster than D&amp;B on the COCO-Subject dataset. Furthermore, through visual comparisons and evaluation of the CLIP-IQA-Real metric, we show that FRAP not only improves prompt-image alignment but also generates more authentic images with realistic appearances. We also explore combining FRAP with prompt rewriting LLM to recover their degraded prompt-image alignment, where we observe improvements in both prompt-image alignment and image quality. We release the code at the following link: https://github.com/LiyaoJiang1998/FRAP/.</description>

      <title>EE-MLLM: A Data-Efficient and Compute-Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated satisfactory performance across various vision-language tasks. Current approaches for vision and language interaction fall into two categories: self-attention-based and cross-attention-based methods. However, both approaches present inherent limitations, forcing a trade-off between data and computational efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce the Data-$\textbf{E}$fficient and Compute-$\textbf{E}$fficient $\textbf{MLLM}$ ($\textbf{EE-MLLM}$). Specifically, we modify the original self-attention mechanism in MLLM to a composite attention mechanism. This mechanism has two key characteristics: 1) eliminating the computational overhead of self-attention among visual tokens to achieve $\textbf{compute efficiency}$, and 2) reusing the weights from each layer of LLM to facilitate effective vision-language modality alignment for $\textbf{data efficiency}$. As a result, EE-MLLM significantly outperforms Flamingo with limited training data, and reduces the prefilling time to 79 ms on an H800 GPU, compared to LLaVA's 277 ms. To further investigate the efficiency of EE-MLLM, we present a training-free variant named EE-MLLM-F, which reduces the computation cost of self-attention-based method without additional training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of EE-MLLM across a range of benchmarks, including general-purpose datasets like MMBench and SeedBench, as well as fine-grained tasks such as TextVQA and DocVQA.</description>

Abstract: Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) demonstrates the highest sensitivity for breast cancer detection among imaging modalities and is standard practice for high-risk women. Interpreting the multi-sequence MRI is time-consuming and prone to subjective variation. We develop a large mixture-of-modality-experts model (MOME) that integrates multiparametric MRI information within a unified structure, leveraging breast MRI scans from 5,205 female patients in China for model development and validation. MOME matches four senior radiologists' performance in identifying breast cancer and outperforms a junior radiologist. The model is able to reduce unnecessary biopsies in Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 4 patients, classify triple-negative breast cancer, and predict pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. MOME further supports inference with missing modalities and provides decision explanations by highlighting lesions and measuring modality contributions. To summarize, MOME exemplifies an accurate and robust multimodal model for noninvasive, personalized management of breast cancer patients via multiparametric MRI.

      <title>Open-Vocabulary Action Localization with Iterative Visual Prompting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17422v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video action localization aims to find the timings of specific actions from a long video. Although existing learning-based approaches have been successful, they require annotating videos, which comes with a considerable labor cost. This paper proposes a training-free, open-vocabulary approach based on emerging off-the-shelf vision-language models (VLMs). The challenge stems from the fact that VLMs are neither designed to process long videos nor tailored for finding actions. We overcome these problems by extending an iterative visual prompting technique. Specifically, we sample video frames and create a concatenated image with frame index labels, allowing a VLM to identify the frames that most likely correspond to the start and end of the action. By iteratively narrowing the sampling window around the selected frames, the estimation gradually converges to more precise temporal boundaries. We demonstrate that this technique yields reasonable performance, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art zero-shot action localization. These results support the use of VLMs as a practical tool for understanding videos. Sample code is available at https://microsoft.github.io/VLM-Video-Action-Localization/</description>

      <title>CyberHost: Taming Audio-driven Avatar Diffusion Model with Region Codebook Attention</title>

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation technology has advanced significantly, catalyzing a proliferation of research in human animation. However, the majority of these studies are confined to same-modality driving settings, with cross-modality human body animation remaining relatively underexplored. In this paper, we introduce, an end-to-end audio-driven human animation framework that ensures hand integrity, identity consistency, and natural motion. The key design of CyberHost is the Region Codebook Attention mechanism, which improves the generation quality of facial and hand animations by integrating fine-grained local features with learned motion pattern priors. Furthermore, we have developed a suite of human-prior-guided training strategies, including body movement map, hand clarity score, pose-aligned reference feature, and local enhancement supervision, to improve synthesis results. To our knowledge, CyberHost is the first end-to-end audio-driven human diffusion model capable of facilitating zero-shot video generation within the scope of human body. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CyberHost surpasses previous works in both quantitative and qualitative aspects.</description>

      <title>BMI Prediction from Handwritten English Characters Using a Convolutional Neural Network</title>

Abstract: A person's Body Mass Index, or BMI, is the most widely used parameter for assessing their health. BMI is a crucial predictor of potential diseases that may arise at higher body fat levels because it is correlated with body fat. Conversely, a community's or an individual's nutritional status can be determined using the BMI. Although deep learning models are used in several studies to estimate BMI from face photos and other data, no previous research established a clear connection between deep learning techniques for handwriting analysis and BMI prediction. This article addresses this research gap with a deep learning approach to estimating BMI from handwritten characters by developing a convolutional neural network (CNN). A dataset containing samples from 48 people in lowercase English scripts is successfully captured for the BMI prediction task. The proposed CNN-based approach reports a commendable accuracy of 99.92%. Performance comparison with other popular CNN architectures reveals that AlexNet and InceptionV3 achieve the second and third-best performance, with the accuracy of 99.69% and 99.53%, respectively.</description>

      <title>RCNet: Deep Recurrent Collaborative Network for Multi-View Low-Light Image Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scene observation from multiple perspectives would bring a more comprehensive visual experience. However, in the context of acquiring multiple views in the dark, the highly correlated views are seriously alienated, making it challenging to improve scene understanding with auxiliary views. Recent single image-based enhancement methods may not be able to provide consistently desirable restoration performance for all views due to the ignorance of potential feature correspondence among different views. To alleviate this issue, we make the first attempt to investigate multi-view low-light image enhancement. First, we construct a new dataset called Multi-View Low-light Triplets (MVLT), including 1,860 pairs of triple images with large illumination ranges and wide noise distribution. Each triplet is equipped with three different viewpoints towards the same scene. Second, we propose a deep multi-view enhancement framework based on the Recurrent Collaborative Network (RCNet). Specifically, in order to benefit from similar texture correspondence across different views, we design the recurrent feature enhancement, alignment and fusion (ReEAF) module, in which intra-view feature enhancement (Intra-view EN) followed by inter-view feature alignment and fusion (Inter-view AF) is performed to model the intra-view and inter-view feature propagation sequentially via multi-view collaboration. In addition, two different modules from enhancement to alignment (E2A) and from alignment to enhancement (A2E) are developed to enable the interactions between Intra-view EN and Inter-view AF, which explicitly utilize attentive feature weighting and sampling for enhancement and alignment, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our RCNet significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. All of our dataset, code, and model will be available at https://github.com/hluo29/RCNet.</description>

      <title>Seeing is Believing? Enhancing Vision-Language Navigation using Visual Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation guided by natural language instructions in embodied environments remains a challenge for vision-language navigation (VLN) agents. Although recent advancements in learning diverse and fine-grained visual environmental representations have shown promise, the fragile performance improvements may not conclusively attribute to enhanced visual grounding,a limitation also observed in related vision-language tasks. In this work, we preliminarily investigate whether advanced VLN models genuinely comprehend the visual content of their environments by introducing varying levels of visual perturbations. These perturbations include ground-truth depth images, perturbed views and random noise. Surprisingly, we experimentally find that simple branch expansion, even with noisy visual inputs, paradoxically improves the navigational efficacy. Inspired by these insights, we further present a versatile Multi-Branch Architecture (MBA) designed to delve into the impact of both the branch quantity and visual quality. The proposed MBA extends a base agent into a multi-branch variant, where each branch processes a different visual input. This approach is embarrassingly simple yet agnostic to topology-based VLN agents. Extensive experiments on three VLN benchmarks (R2R, REVERIE, SOON) demonstrate that our method with optimal visual permutations matches or even surpasses state-of-the-art results. The source code is available at here.</description>

      <title>NeIn: Telling What You Don't Want</title>

Abstract: Negation is a fundamental linguistic concept used by humans to convey information that they do not desire. Despite this, minimal research has focused on negation within text-guided image editing. This lack of research means that vision-language models (VLMs) for image editing may struggle to understand negation, implying that they struggle to provide accurate results. One barrier to achieving human-level intelligence is the lack of a standard collection by which research into negation can be evaluated. This paper presents the first large-scale dataset, Negative Instruction (NeIn), for studying negation within instruction-based image editing. Our dataset comprises 366,957 quintuplets, i.e., source image, original caption, selected object, negative sentence, and target image in total, including 342,775 queries for training and 24,182 queries for benchmarking image editing methods. Specifically, we automatically generate NeIn based on a large, existing vision-language dataset, MS-COCO, via two steps: generation and filtering. During the generation phase, we leverage two VLMs, BLIP and InstructPix2Pix (fine-tuned on MagicBrush dataset), to generate NeIn's samples and the negative clauses that expresses the content of the source image. In the subsequent filtering phase, we apply BLIP and LLaVA-NeXT to remove erroneous samples. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation protocol to assess the negation understanding for image editing models. Extensive experiments using our dataset across multiple VLMs for text-guided image editing demonstrate that even recent state-of-the-art VLMs struggle to understand negative queries.</description>

      <title>Expansive Supervision for Neural Radiance Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has achieved remarkable success in creating immersive media representations through its exceptional reconstruction capabilities. However, the computational demands of dense forward passes and volume rendering during training continue to challenge its real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce Expansive Supervision to reduce time and memory costs during NeRF training from the perspective of partial ray selection for supervision. Specifically, we observe that training errors exhibit a long-tail distribution correlated with image content. Based on this observation, our method selectively renders a small but crucial subset of pixels and expands their values to estimate errors across the entire area for each iteration. Compared to conventional supervision, our approach effectively bypasses redundant rendering processes, resulting in substantial reductions in both time and memory consumption. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating Expansive Supervision within existing state-of-the-art acceleration frameworks achieves 52% memory savings and 16% time savings while maintaining comparable visual quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects children's social and communication abilities, with eye-tracking widely used to identify atypical gaze patterns. While unsupervised clustering can automate the creation of areas of interest for gaze feature extraction, the use of internal cluster validity indices, like Silhouette Coefficient, to distinguish gaze pattern differences between ASD and typically developing (TD) children remains underexplored. We explore whether internal cluster validity indices can distinguish ASD from TD children. Specifically, we apply seven clustering algorithms to gaze points and extract 63 internal cluster validity indices to reveal correlations with ASD diagnosis. Using these indices, we train predictive models for ASD diagnosis. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate high predictive accuracy (81\% AUC), validating the effectiveness of these indices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19702v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown impressive results for the novel view synthesis task, where lighting is assumed to be fixed. However, creating relightable 3D assets, especially for objects with ill-defined shapes (fur, fabric, etc.), remains a challenging task. The decomposition between light, geometry, and material is ambiguous, especially if either smooth surface assumptions or surfacebased analytical shading models do not apply. We propose Relightable Neural Gaussians (RNG), a novel 3DGS-based framework that enables the relighting of objects with both hard surfaces or soft boundaries, while avoiding assumptions on the shading model. We condition the radiance at each point on both view and light directions. We also introduce a shadow cue, as well as a depth refinement network to improve shadow accuracy. Finally, we propose a hybrid forward-deferred fitting strategy to balance geometry and appearance quality. Our method achieves significantly faster training (1.3 hours) and rendering (60 frames per second) compared to a prior method based on neural radiance fields and produces higher-quality shadows than a concurrent 3DGS-based method.

      <title>Exploring Semi-Supervised Learning for Online Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to generate online maps using only onboard sensory information is crucial for enabling autonomous driving beyond well-mapped areas. Training models for this task -- predicting lane markers, road edges, and pedestrian crossings -- traditionally require extensive labelled data, which is expensive and labour-intensive to obtain. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) has shown promise in other domains, its potential for online mapping remains largely underexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by demonstrating the effectiveness of SSL methods for online mapping. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective method leveraging the inherent properties of online mapping by fusing the teacher's pseudo-labels from multiple samples, enhancing the reliability of self-supervised training. If 10% of the data has labels, our method to leverage unlabelled data achieves a 3.5x performance boost compared to only using the labelled data. This narrows the gap to a fully supervised model, using all labels, to just 3.5 mIoU. We also show strong generalization to unseen cities. Specifically, in Argoverse 2, when adapting to Pittsburgh, incorporating purely unlabelled target-domain data reduces the performance gap from 5 to 0.5 mIoU. These results highlight the potential of SSL as a powerful tool for solving the online mapping problem, significantly reducing reliance on labelled data.</description>

      <title>A Simple Approach to Unifying Diffusion-based Conditional Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in image generation has sparked research into controlling these models through condition signals, with various methods addressing specific challenges in conditional generation. Instead of proposing another specialized technique, we introduce a simple, unified framework to handle diverse conditional generation tasks involving a specific image-condition correlation. By learning a joint distribution over a correlated image pair (e.g. image and depth) with a diffusion model, our approach enables versatile capabilities via different inference-time sampling schemes, including controllable image generation (e.g. depth to image), estimation (e.g. image to depth), signal guidance, joint generation (image &amp; depth), and coarse control. Previous attempts at unification often introduce significant complexity through multi-stage training, architectural modification, or increased parameter counts. In contrast, our simple formulation requires a single, computationally efficient training stage, maintains the standard model input, and adds minimal learned parameters (15% of the base model). Moreover, our model supports additional capabilities like non-spatially aligned and coarse conditioning. Extensive results show that our single model can produce comparable results with specialized methods and better results than prior unified methods. We also demonstrate that multiple models can be effectively combined for multi-signal conditional generation.</description>

      <title>Layout-your-3D: Controllable and Precise 3D Generation with 2D Blueprint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Layout-Your-3D, a framework that allows controllable and compositional 3D generation from text prompts. Existing text-to-3D methods often struggle to generate assets with plausible object interactions or require tedious optimization processes. To address these challenges, our approach leverages 2D layouts as a blueprint to facilitate precise and plausible control over 3D generation. Starting with a 2D layout provided by a user or generated from a text description, we first create a coarse 3D scene using a carefully designed initialization process based on efficient reconstruction models. To enforce coherent global 3D layouts and enhance the quality of instance appearances, we propose a collision-aware layout optimization process followed by instance-wise refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that Layout-Your-3D yields more reasonable and visually appealing compositional 3D assets while significantly reducing the time required for each prompt. Additionally, Layout-Your-3D can be easily applicable to downstream tasks, such as 3D editing and object insertion.

      <description>arXiv:2410.18074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose UnCLe, a standardized benchmark for Unsupervised Continual Learning of a multimodal depth estimation task: Depth completion aims to infer a dense depth map from a pair of synchronized RGB image and sparse depth map. We benchmark depth completion models under the practical scenario of unsupervised learning over continuous streams of data. Existing methods are typically trained on a static, or stationary, dataset. However, when adapting to novel non-stationary distributions, they "catastrophically forget" previously learned information. UnCLe simulates these non-stationary distributions by adapting depth completion models to sequences of datasets containing diverse scenes captured from distinct domains using different visual and range sensors. We adopt representative methods from continual learning paradigms and translate them to enable unsupervised continual learning of depth completion. We benchmark these models for indoor and outdoor and investigate the degree of catastrophic forgetting through standard quantitative metrics. Furthermore, we introduce model inversion quality as an additional measure of forgetting. We find that unsupervised continual learning of depth completion is an open problem, and we invite researchers to leverage UnCLe as a development platform.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Bilingual Multimodal Large Language Model for Diverse Biomedical Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18387v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several medical Multimodal Large Languange Models (MLLMs) have been developed to address tasks involving visual images with textual instructions across various medical modalities, achieving impressive results. Most current medical generalist models are region-agnostic, treating the entire image as a holistic representation. However, they struggle to identify which specific regions they are focusing on when generating a sentence. To mimic the behavior of doctors, who typically begin by reviewing the entire image before concentrating on specific regions for a thorough evaluation, we aim to enhance the capability of medical MLLMs in understanding anatomical regions within entire medical scans. To achieve it, we first formulate Region-Centric tasks and construct a large-scale dataset, MedRegInstruct, to incorporate regional information into training. Combining our collected dataset with other medical multimodal corpora for training, we propose a Region-Aware medical MLLM, MedRegA, which is the first bilingual generalist medical AI system to simultaneously handle image-level and region-level medical vision-language tasks across a broad range of modalities. Our MedRegA not only enables three region-centric tasks, but also achieves the best performance for visual question answering, report generation and medical image classification over 8 modalities, showcasing significant versatility. Experiments demonstrate that our model can not only accomplish powerful performance across various medical vision-language tasks in bilingual settings, but also recognize and detect structures in multimodal medical scans, boosting the interpretability and user interactivity of medical MLLMs. Our project page is https://medrega.github.io.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained recognition for generating diverse and high-quality content, especially in image synthesis. These models excel not only in creating fixed-size images but also in producing panoramic images. However, existing methods often struggle with spatial layout consistency when producing high-resolution panoramas due to the lack of guidance on the global image layout. This paper introduces the Multi-Scale Diffusion (MSD), an optimized framework that extends the panoramic image generation framework to multiple resolution levels. Our method leverages gradient descent techniques to incorporate structural information from low-resolution images into high-resolution outputs. Through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations against prior work, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the coherence of high-resolution panorama generation.</description>

Abstract: Customized image generation is essential for creating personalized content based on user prompts, allowing large-scale text-to-image diffusion models to more effectively meet individual needs. However, existing models often neglect the relationships between customized objects in generated images. In contrast, this work addresses this gap by focusing on relation-aware customized image generation, which seeks to preserve the identities from image prompts while maintaining the relationship specified in text prompts. Specifically, we introduce DreamRelation, a framework that disentangles identity and relation learning using a carefully curated dataset. Our training data consists of relation-specific images, independent object images containing identity information, and text prompts to guide relation generation. Then, we propose two key modules to tackle the two main challenges: generating accurate and natural relationships, especially when significant pose adjustments are required, and avoiding object confusion in cases of overlap. First, we introduce a keypoint matching loss that effectively guides the model in adjusting object poses closely tied to their relationships. Second, we incorporate local features of the image prompts to better distinguish between objects, preventing confusion in overlapping cases. Extensive results on our proposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DreamRelation in generating precise relations while preserving object identities across a diverse set of objects and relationships.</description>

      <title>Tell What You Hear From What You See -- Video to Audio Generation Through Text</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The content of visual and audio scenes is multi-faceted such that a video can be paired with various audio and vice-versa. Thereby, in video-to-audio generation task, it is imperative to introduce steering approaches for controlling the generated audio. While Video-to-Audio generation is a well-established generative task, existing methods lack such controllability. In this work, we propose VATT, a multi-modal generative framework that takes a video and an optional text prompt as input, and generates audio and optional textual description of the audio. Such a framework has two advantages: i) Video-to-Audio generation process can be refined and controlled via text which complements the context of visual information, and ii) The model can suggest what audio to generate for the video by generating audio captions. VATT consists of two key modules: VATT Converter, a LLM that is fine-tuned for instructions and includes a projection layer that maps video features to the LLM vector space; and VATT Audio, a transformer that generates audio tokens from visual frames and from optional text prompt using iterative parallel decoding. The audio tokens are converted to a waveform by pretrained neural codec. Experiments show that when VATT is compared to existing video-to-audio generation methods in objective metrics, it achieves competitive performance when the audio caption is not provided. When the audio caption is provided as a prompt, VATT achieves even more refined performance (lowest KLD score of 1.41). Furthermore, subjective studies show that VATT Audio has been chosen as preferred generated audio than audio generated by existing methods. VATT enables controllable video-to-audio generation through text as well as suggesting text prompts for videos through audio captions, unlocking novel applications such as text-guided video-to-audio generation and video-to-audio captioning.</description>

      <title>Which Viewpoint Shows it Best? Language for Weakly Supervising View Selection in Multi-view Instructional Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a multi-view video, which viewpoint is most informative for a human observer? Existing methods rely on heuristics or expensive "best-view" supervision to answer this question, limiting their applicability. We propose a weakly supervised approach that leverages language accompanying an instructional multi-view video as a means to recover its most informative viewpoint(s). Our key hypothesis is that the more accurately an individual view can predict a view-agnostic text summary, the more informative it is. To put this into action, we propose LangView, a framework that uses the relative accuracy of view-dependent caption predictions as a proxy for best view pseudo-labels. Then, those pseudo-labels are used to train a view selector, together with an auxiliary camera pose predictor that enhances view-sensitivity. During inference, our model takes as input only a multi-view video--no language or camera poses--and returns the best viewpoint to watch at each timestep. On two challenging datasets comprised of diverse multi-camera setups and how-to activities, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, both with quantitative metrics and human evaluation.

      <description>arXiv:2411.09439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have emerged as an extension of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling the integration of various modalities. However, Any-to-Any MLLMs are limited to generating pairwise modalities 'Text + X' within a single response, such as Text + {Image or Audio or Video}. To address this limitation, we introduce Spider, a novel efficient Any-to-Many Modalities Generation (AMMG) framework, which can generate an arbitrary combination of modalities 'Text + Xs', such as Text + {Image and Audio and Video}. To achieve efficient AMMG, our Spider integrates three core components: a Base Model for basic X-to-X (i.e., Any-to-Any) modality processing, an Any-to-Many Instruction Template designed for producing Xs signal prompts, and a novel Efficient Decoders-Controller for controlling multimodal Decoders to generate Xs (many-modal) contents. To train Spider, we constructed a novel Text-formatted Many-Modal (TMM) dataset, which facilitates learning the X-to-Xs (i.e., Any-to-Many) capability necessary for AMMG. Ultimately, the well-trained Spider generates a pseudo X-to-Xs dataset, the first-ever X-to-Xs many-modal dataset, enhancing the potential for AMMG tasks in future research. Overall, this work not only pushes the boundary of multimodal interaction but also provides rich data support for advancing the field. Code: https://github.com/Layjins/Spider</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) is a new technique that adapts well-trained frozen models for source domain tasks to target domain tasks. This study examines VP's benefits for black-box model-level backdoor detection. The visual prompt in VP maps class subspaces between source and target domains. We identify a misalignment, termed class subspace inconsistency, between clean and poisoned datasets. Based on this, we introduce \textsc{BProm}, a black-box model-level detection method to identify backdoors in suspicious models, if any. \textsc{BProm} leverages the low classification accuracy of prompted models when backdoors are present. Extensive experiments confirm \textsc{BProm}'s effectiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce DiffFNO, a novel diffusion framework for arbitrary-scale super-resolution strengthened by a Weighted Fourier Neural Operator (WFNO). Mode Rebalancing in WFNO effectively captures critical frequency components, significantly improving the reconstruction of high-frequency image details that are crucial for super-resolution tasks. Gated Fusion Mechanism (GFM) adaptively complements WFNO's spectral features with spatial features from an Attention-based Neural Operator (AttnNO). This enhances the network's capability to capture both global structures and local details. Adaptive Time-Step (ATS) ODE solver, a deterministic sampling strategy, accelerates inference without sacrificing output quality by dynamically adjusting integration step sizes ATS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffFNO achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, outperforming existing methods across various scaling factors by a margin of 2-4 dB in PSNR, including those beyond the training distribution. It also achieves this at lower inference time. Our approach sets a new standard in super-resolution, delivering both superior accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>LiDAR-based End-to-end Temporal Perception for Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal perception, defined as the capability to detect and track objects across temporal sequences, serves as a fundamental component in autonomous driving systems. While single-vehicle perception systems encounter limitations, stemming from incomplete perception due to object occlusion and inherent blind spots, cooperative perception systems present their own challenges in terms of sensor calibration precision and positioning accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce LET-VIC, a LiDAR-based End-to-End Tracking framework for Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperation (VIC). First, we employ Temporal Self-Attention and VIC Cross-Attention modules to effectively integrate temporal and spatial information from both vehicle and infrastructure perspectives. Then, we develop a novel Calibration Error Compensation (CEC) module to mitigate sensor misalignment issues and facilitate accurate feature alignment. Experiments on the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset demonstrate that LET-VIC significantly outperforms baseline models. Compared to LET-V, LET-VIC achieves +15.0% improvement in mAP and a +17.3% improvement in AMOTA. Furthermore, LET-VIC surpasses representative Tracking by Detection models, including V2VNet, FFNet, and PointPillars, with at least a +13.7% improvement in mAP and a +13.1% improvement in AMOTA without considering communication delays, showcasing its robust detection and tracking performance. The experiments demonstrate that the integration of multi-view perspectives, temporal sequences, or CEC in end-to-end training significantly improves both detection and tracking performance. All code will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Scenes: Pose-Free Sparse-View Scene Reconstruction using Depth-Enhanced Diffusion Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a generative approach for pose-free (without camera parameters) reconstruction of 360 scenes from a sparse set of 2D images. Pose-free scene reconstruction from incomplete, pose-free observations is usually regularized with depth estimation or 3D foundational priors. While recent advances have enabled sparse-view reconstruction of large complex scenes (with high degree of foreground and background detail) with known camera poses using view-conditioned generative priors, these methods cannot be directly adapted for the pose-free setting when ground-truth poses are not available during evaluation. To address this, we propose an image-to-image generative model designed to inpaint missing details and remove artifacts in novel view renders and depth maps of a 3D scene. We introduce context and geometry conditioning using Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) modulation layers as a lightweight alternative to cross-attention and also propose a novel confidence measure for 3D Gaussian splat representations to allow for better detection of these artifacts. By progressively integrating these novel views in a Gaussian-SLAM-inspired process, we achieve a multi-view-consistent 3D representation. Evaluations on the MipNeRF360 and DL3DV-10K benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing pose-free techniques and performs competitively with state-of-the-art posed (precomputed camera parameters are given) reconstruction methods in complex 360 scenes.</description>

      <title>RoboSpatial: Teaching Spatial Understanding to 2D and 3D Vision-Language Models for Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16537v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial understanding is a crucial capability that enables robots to perceive their surroundings, reason about their environment, and interact with it meaningfully. In modern robotics, these capabilities are increasingly provided by vision-language models. However, these models face significant challenges in spatial reasoning tasks, as their training data are based on general-purpose image datasets that often lack sophisticated spatial understanding. For example, datasets frequently do not capture reference frame comprehension, yet effective spatial reasoning requires understanding whether to reason from ego-, world-, or object-centric perspectives. To address this issue, we introduce RoboSpatial, a large-scale dataset for spatial understanding in robotics. It consists of real indoor and tabletop scenes, captured as 3D scans and egocentric images, and annotated with rich spatial information relevant to robotics. The dataset includes 1M images, 5k 3D scans, and 3M annotated spatial relationships, and the pairing of 2D egocentric images with 3D scans makes it both 2D- and 3D- ready. Our experiments show that models trained with RoboSpatial outperform baselines on downstream tasks such as spatial affordance prediction, spatial relationship prediction, and robot manipulation.</description>

      <title>TIDE: Training Locally Interpretable Domain Generalization Models Enables Test-time Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of single-source domain generalization. Existing methods typically rely on extensive augmentations to synthetically cover diverse domains during training. However, they struggle with semantic shifts (e.g., background and viewpoint changes), as they often learn global features instead of local concepts that tend to be domain invariant. To address this gap, we propose an approach that compels models to leverage such local concepts during prediction. Given no suitable dataset with per-class concepts and localization maps exists, we first develop a novel pipeline to generate annotations by exploiting the rich features of diffusion and large-language models. Our next innovation is TIDE, a novel training scheme with a concept saliency alignment loss that ensures model focus on the right per-concept regions and a local concept contrastive loss that promotes learning domain-invariant concept representations. This not only gives a robust model but also can be visually interpreted using the predicted concept saliency maps. Given these maps at test time, our final contribution is a new correction algorithm that uses the corresponding local concept representations to iteratively refine the prediction until it aligns with prototypical concept representations that we store at the end of model training. We evaluate our approach extensively on four standard DG benchmark datasets and substantially outperform the current state-ofthe-art (12% improvement on average) while also demonstrating that our predictions can be visually interpreted</description>

      <title>Distilling Spectral Graph for Object-Context Aware Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) has advanced with recent vision-language models (VLMs), enabling segmentation beyond predefined categories through various learning schemes. Notably, training-free methods offer scalable, easily deployable solutions for handling unseen data, a key goal of OVSS. Yet, a critical issue persists: lack of object-level context consideration when segmenting complex objects in the challenging environment of OVSS based on arbitrary query prompts. This oversight limits models' ability to group semantically consistent elements within object and map them precisely to user-defined arbitrary classes. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that overcomes this limitation by incorporating object-level contextual knowledge within images. Specifically, our model enhances intra-object consistency by distilling spectral-driven features from vision foundation models into the attention mechanism of the visual encoder, enabling semantically coherent components to form a single object mask. Additionally, we refine the text embeddings with zero-shot object presence likelihood to ensure accurate alignment with the specific objects represented in the images. By leveraging object-level contextual knowledge, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalizability across diverse datasets.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17190v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose SelfSplat, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting model designed to perform pose-free and 3D prior-free generalizable 3D reconstruction from unposed multi-view images. These settings are inherently ill-posed due to the lack of ground-truth data, learned geometric information, and the need to achieve accurate 3D reconstruction without finetuning, making it difficult for conventional methods to achieve high-quality results. Our model addresses these challenges by effectively integrating explicit 3D representations with self-supervised depth and pose estimation techniques, resulting in reciprocal improvements in both pose accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a matching-aware pose estimation network and a depth refinement module to enhance geometry consistency across views, ensuring more accurate and stable 3D reconstructions. To present the performance of our method, we evaluated it on large-scale real-world datasets, including RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. SelfSplat achieves superior results over previous state-of-the-art methods in both appearance and geometry quality, also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization capabilities. Extensive ablation studies and analysis also validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Code and pretrained models are available at https://gynjn.github.io/selfsplat/</description>

Abstract: Light-matter interactions modify both the intensity and polarization state of light. Changes in polarization, represented by a Mueller matrix, encode detailed scene information. Existing optical ellipsometers capture Mueller-matrix images; however, they are often limited to capturing static scenes due to long acquisition times. Here, we introduce Event Ellipsometer, a method for acquiring a Mueller-matrix video for dynamic scenes. Our imaging system employs fast-rotating quarter-wave plates (QWPs) in front of a light source and an event camera that asynchronously captures intensity changes induced by the rotating QWPs. We develop an ellipsometric-event image formation model, a calibration method, and an ellipsometric-event reconstruction method. We experimentally demonstrate that Event Ellipsometer enables Mueller-matrix video imaging at 30fps, extending ellipsometry to dynamic scenes.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, deepfakes (DFs) have been utilized for malicious purposes, such as individual impersonation, misinformation spreading, and artists style imitation, raising questions about ethical and security concerns. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review and comparison of passive DF detection across multiple modalities, including image, video, audio, and multi-modal, to explore the inter-modality relationships between them. Beyond detection accuracy, we extend our analysis to encompass crucial performance dimensions essential for real-world deployment: generalization capabilities across novel generation techniques, robustness against adversarial manipulations and postprocessing techniques, attribution precision in identifying generation sources, and resilience under real-world operational conditions. Additionally, we analyze the advantages and limitations of existing datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics for passive DF detection. Finally, we propose future research directions that address these unexplored and emerging issues in the field of passive DF detection. This survey offers researchers and practitioners a comprehensive resource for understanding the current landscape, methodological approaches, and promising future directions in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

Abstract: Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the 3D physical world is an emerging yet challenging research direction. Current strategies for processing point clouds typically downsample the scene or divide it into smaller parts for separate analysis. However, both approaches risk losing key local details or global contextual information. In this paper, we introduce PerLA, a 3D language assistant designed to be more perceptive to both details and context, making visual representations more informative for the LLM. PerLA captures high-resolution (local) details in parallel from different point cloud areas and integrates them with (global) context obtained from a lower-resolution whole point cloud. We present a novel algorithm that preserves point cloud locality through the Hilbert curve and effectively aggregates local-to-global information via cross-attention and a graph neural network. Lastly, we introduce a novel loss for local representation consensus to promote training stability. PerLA outperforms state-of-the-art 3D language assistants, with gains of up to +1.34 CiDEr on ScanQA for question answering, and +4.22 on ScanRefer and +3.88 on Nr3D for dense captioning. https://gfmei.github.io/PerLA/</description>

      <title>DiffPatch: Generating Customizable Adversarial Patches using Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Physical adversarial patches printed on clothing can enable individuals to evade person detectors, but most existing methods prioritize attack effectiveness over stealthiness, resulting in aesthetically unpleasing patches. While generative adversarial networks and diffusion models can produce more natural-looking patches, they often fail to balance stealthiness with attack effectiveness and lack flexibility for user customization. To address these limitations, we propose DiffPatch, a novel diffusion-based framework for generating customizable and naturalistic adversarial patches. Our approach allows users to start from a reference image (rather than random noise) and incorporates masks to create patches of various shapes, not limited to squares. To preserve the original semantics during the diffusion process, we employ Null-text inversion to map random noise samples to a single input image and generate patches through Incomplete Diffusion Optimization (IDO). Our method achieves attack performance comparable to state-of-the-art non-naturalistic patches while maintaining a natural appearance. Using DiffPatch, we construct AdvT-shirt-1K, the first physical adversarial T-shirt dataset comprising over a thousand images captured in diverse scenarios. AdvT-shirt-1K can serve as a useful dataset for training or testing future defense methods.</description>

      <title>CleanDIFT: Diffusion Features without Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Internal features from large-scale pre-trained diffusion models have recently been established as powerful semantic descriptors for a wide range of downstream tasks. Works that use these features generally need to add noise to images before passing them through the model to obtain the semantic features, as the models do not offer the most useful features when given images with little to no noise. We show that this noise has a critical impact on the usefulness of these features that cannot be remedied by ensembling with different random noises. We address this issue by introducing a lightweight, unsupervised fine-tuning method that enables diffusion backbones to provide high-quality, noise-free semantic features. We show that these features readily outperform previous diffusion features by a wide margin in a wide variety of extraction setups and downstream tasks, offering better performance than even ensemble-based methods at a fraction of the cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03937v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Apparel is essential to human life, offering protection, mirroring cultural identities, and showcasing personal style. Yet, the creation of garments remains a time-consuming process, largely due to the manual work involved in designing them. To simplify this process, we introduce AIpparel, a multimodal foundation model for generating and editing sewing patterns. Our model fine-tunes state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs) on a custom-curated large-scale dataset of over 120,000 unique garments, each with multimodal annotations including text, images, and sewing patterns. Additionally, we propose a novel tokenization scheme that concisely encodes these complex sewing patterns so that LLMs can learn to predict them efficiently. AIpparel achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-modal tasks, including text-to-garment and image-to-garment prediction, and enables novel multimodal garment generation applications such as interactive garment editing.

      <title>DualPM: Dual Posed-Canonical Point Maps for 3D Shape and Pose Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04464v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The choice of data representation is a key factor in the success of deep learning in geometric tasks. For instance, DUSt3R recently introduced the concept of viewpoint-invariant point maps, generalizing depth prediction and showing that all key problems in the 3D reconstruction of static scenes can be reduced to predicting such point maps. In this paper, we develop an analogous concept for a very different problem: the reconstruction of the 3D shape and pose of deformable objects. To this end, we introduce Dual Point Maps (DualPM), where a pair of point maps is extracted from the same image-one associating pixels to their 3D locations on the object and the other to a canonical version of the object in its rest pose. We also extend point maps to amodal reconstruction to recover the complete shape of the object, even through self-occlusions. We show that 3D reconstruction and 3D pose estimation can be reduced to the prediction of DualPMs. Empirically, we demonstrate that this representation is a suitable target for deep networks to predict. Specifically, we focus on modeling quadrupeds, showing that DualPMs can be trained purely on synthetic 3D data, consisting of one or two models per category, while generalizing effectively to real images. With this approach, we achieve significant improvements over previous methods for the 3D analysis and reconstruction of such objects.</description>

      <title>Language-Guided Image Tokenization for Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image tokenization, the process of transforming raw image pixels into a compact low-dimensional latent representation, has proven crucial for scalable and efficient image generation. However, mainstream image tokenization methods generally have limited compression rates, making high-resolution image generation computationally expensive. To address this challenge, we propose to leverage language for efficient image tokenization, and we call our method Text-Conditioned Image Tokenization (TexTok). TexTok is a simple yet effective tokenization framework that leverages language to provide a compact, high-level semantic representation. By conditioning the tokenization process on descriptive text captions, TexTok simplifies semantic learning, allowing more learning capacity and token space to be allocated to capture fine-grained visual details, leading to enhanced reconstruction quality and higher compression rates. Compared to the conventional tokenizer without text conditioning, TexTok achieves average reconstruction FID improvements of 29.2% and 48.1% on ImageNet-256 and -512 benchmarks respectively, across varying numbers of tokens. These tokenization improvements consistently translate to 16.3% and 34.3% average improvements in generation FID. By simply replacing the tokenizer in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with TexTok, our system can achieve a 93.5x inference speedup while still outperforming the original DiT using only 32 tokens on ImageNet-512. TexTok with a vanilla DiT generator achieves state-of-the-art FID scores of 1.46 and 1.62 on ImageNet-256 and -512 respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate TexTok's superiority on the text-to-image generation task, effectively utilizing the off-the-shelf text captions in tokenization.

      <title>Doppelgangers++: Improved Visual Disambiguation with Geometric 3D Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction is frequently hindered by visual aliasing, where visually similar but distinct surfaces (aka, doppelgangers), are incorrectly matched. These spurious matches distort the structure-from-motion (SfM) process, leading to misplaced model elements and reduced accuracy. Prior efforts addressed this with CNN classifiers trained on curated datasets, but these approaches struggle to generalize across diverse real-world scenes and can require extensive parameter tuning. In this work, we present Doppelgangers++, a method to enhance doppelganger detection and improve 3D reconstruction accuracy. Our contributions include a diversified training dataset that incorporates geo-tagged images from everyday scenes to expand robustness beyond landmark-based datasets. We further propose a Transformer-based classifier that leverages 3D-aware features from the MASt3R model, achieving superior precision and recall across both in-domain and out-of-domain tests. Doppelgangers++ integrates seamlessly into standard SfM and MASt3R-SfM pipelines, offering efficiency and adaptability across varied scenes. To evaluate SfM accuracy, we introduce an automated, geotag-based method for validating reconstructed models, eliminating the need for manual inspection. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Doppelgangers++ significantly enhances pairwise visual disambiguation and improves 3D reconstruction quality in complex and diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Track4Gen: Teaching Video Diffusion Models to Track Points Improves Video Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While recent foundational video generators produce visually rich output, they still struggle with appearance drift, where objects gradually degrade or change inconsistently across frames, breaking visual coherence. We hypothesize that this is because there is no explicit supervision in terms of spatial tracking at the feature level. We propose Track4Gen, a spatially aware video generator that combines video diffusion loss with point tracking across frames, providing enhanced spatial supervision on the diffusion features. Track4Gen merges the video generation and point tracking tasks into a single network by making minimal changes to existing video generation architectures. Using Stable Video Diffusion as a backbone, Track4Gen demonstrates that it is possible to unify video generation and point tracking, which are typically handled as separate tasks. Our extensive evaluations show that Track4Gen effectively reduces appearance drift, resulting in temporally stable and visually coherent video generation.

      <title>Agent Journey Beyond RGB: Unveiling Hybrid Semantic-Spatial Environmental Representations for Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06465v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigating unseen environments based on natural language instructions remains difficult for egocentric agents in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). Existing approaches primarily rely on RGB images for environmental representation, underutilizing latent textual semantic and spatial cues and leaving the modality gap between instructions and scarce environmental representations unresolved. Intuitively, humans inherently ground semantic knowledge within spatial layouts during indoor navigation. Inspired by this, we propose a versatile Semantic Understanding and Spatial Awareness (SUSA) architecture to encourage agents to ground environment from diverse perspectives. SUSA includes a Textual Semantic Understanding (TSU) module, which narrows the modality gap between instructions and environments by generating and associating the descriptions of environmental landmarks in agent's immediate surroundings. Additionally, a Depth-enhanced Spatial Perception (DSP) module incrementally constructs a depth exploration map, enabling a more nuanced comprehension of environmental layouts. Experiments demonstrate that SUSA's hybrid semantic-spatial representations effectively enhance navigation performance, setting new state-of-the-art performance across three VLN benchmarks (REVERIE, R2R, and SOON). The source code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>LUIEO: A Lightweight Model for Integrating Underwater Image Enhancement and Object Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Underwater optical images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors such as blurring, low contrast, and color distortion, which hinder the accuracy of object detection tasks. Due to the lack of paired underwater/clean images, most research methods adopt a strategy of first enhancing and then detecting, resulting in a lack of feature communication between the two learning tasks. On the other hand, due to the contradiction between the diverse degradation factors of underwater images and the limited number of samples, existing underwater enhancement methods are difficult to effectively enhance degraded images of unknown water bodies, thereby limiting the improvement of object detection accuracy. Therefore, most underwater target detection results are still displayed on degraded images, making it difficult to visually judge the correctness of the detection results. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multi-task learning method that simultaneously enhances underwater images and improves detection accuracy. Compared with single-task learning, the integrated model allows for the dynamic adjustment of information communication and sharing between different tasks. Due to the fact that real underwater images can only provide annotated object labels, this paper introduces physical constraints to ensure that object detection tasks do not interfere with image enhancement tasks. Therefore, this article introduces a physical module to decompose underwater images into clean images, background light, and transmission images and uses a physical model to calculate underwater images for self-supervision. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves satisfactory results in visual performance, object detection accuracy, and detection efficiency compared to state-of-the-art comparative methods.</description>

      <title>How to select slices for annotation to train best-performing deep learning segmentation models for cross-sectional medical images?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated segmentation of medical images heavily relies on the availability of precise manual annotations. However, generating these annotations is often time-consuming, expensive, and sometimes requires specialized expertise (especially for cross-sectional medical images). Therefore, it is essential to optimize the use of annotation resources to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. In this paper, we systematically address the question: "in a non-interactive annotation pipeline, how should slices from cross-sectional medical images be selected for annotation to maximize the performance of the resulting deep learning segmentation models?" We conducted experiments on 4 medical imaging segmentation tasks with varying annotation budgets, numbers of annotated cases, numbers of annotated slices per volume, slice selection techniques, and mask interpolations. We found that:
  1) It is almost always preferable to annotate fewer slices per volume and more volumes given an annotation budget. 2) Selecting slices for annotation by unsupervised active learning (UAL) is not superior to selecting slices randomly or at fixed intervals, provided that each volume is allocated the same number of annotated slices. 3) Interpolating masks between annotated slices rarely enhances model performance, with exceptions of some specific configuration for 3D models.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Scaling Effect of Instruction Templates for Training Multimodal Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current multimodal language model (MLM) training approaches overlook the influence of instruction templates. Previous research deals with this problem by leveraging hand-crafted or model-generated templates, failing to investigate the scaling effect of instruction templates on MLM training. In this work, we propose a programmatic instruction template generator capable of producing over 15K unique instruction templates by filling randomly sampled positional synonyms into weighted sampled meta templates, enabling us to comprehensively explore MLM's performance across various template scales in the training process. Our investigation into scaling instruction templates for MLM training demonstrates that MLM capabilities do not consistently improve with increasing template scale. Instead, optimal performance is achieved at a medium template scale. Models trained with data augmented at the optimal template scale achieve performance gains of up to 10% over those trained on the original data and achieve the best overall performance compared with the similar-scale MLMs tuned on at most 75 times the scale of our augmented dataset. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/shijian2001/TemplateScaling.</description>

      <title>MultiEYE: Dataset and Benchmark for OCT-Enhanced Retinal Disease Recognition from Fundus Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing multi-modal learning methods on fundus and OCT images mostly require both modalities to be available and strictly paired for training and testing, which appears less practical in clinical scenarios. To expand the scope of clinical applications, we formulate a novel setting, "OCT-enhanced disease recognition from fundus images", that allows for the use of unpaired multi-modal data during the training phase and relies on the widespread fundus photographs for testing. To benchmark this setting, we present the first large multi-modal multi-class dataset for eye disease diagnosis, MultiEYE, and propose an OCT-assisted Conceptual Distillation Approach (OCT-CoDA), which employs semantically rich concepts to extract disease-related knowledge from OCT images and leverage them into the fundus model. Specifically, we regard the image-concept relation as a link to distill useful knowledge from the OCT teacher model to the fundus student model, which considerably improves the diagnostic performance based on fundus images and formulates the cross-modal knowledge transfer into an explainable process. Through extensive experiments on the multi-disease classification task, our proposed OCT-CoDA demonstrates remarkable results and interpretability, showing great potential for clinical application. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/MultiEYE.</description>

      <title>FSFM: A Generalizable Face Security Foundation Model via Self-Supervised Facial Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work asks: with abundant, unlabeled real faces, how to learn a robust and transferable facial representation that boosts various face security tasks with respect to generalization performance? We make the first attempt and propose a self-supervised pretraining framework to learn fundamental representations of real face images, FSFM, that leverages the synergy between masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID). We explore various facial masking strategies for MIM and present a simple yet powerful CRFR-P masking, which explicitly forces the model to capture meaningful intra-region consistency and challenging inter-region coherency. Furthermore, we devise the ID network that naturally couples with MIM to establish underlying local-to-global correspondence via tailored self-distillation. These three learning objectives, namely 3C, empower encoding both local features and global semantics of real faces. After pretraining, a vanilla ViT serves as a universal vision foundation model for downstream face security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection, cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forgery detection. Extensive experiments on 10 public datasets demonstrate that our model transfers better than supervised pretraining, visual and facial self-supervised learning arts, and even outperforms task-specialized SOTA methods.</description>

      <title>Pattern Analogies: Learning to Perform Programmatic Image Edits by Analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pattern images are everywhere in the digital and physical worlds, and tools to edit them are valuable. But editing pattern images is tricky: desired edits are often programmatic: structure-aware edits that alter the underlying program which generates the pattern. One could attempt to infer this underlying program, but current methods for doing so struggle with complex images and produce unorganized programs that make editing tedious. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to perform programmatic edits on pattern images. By using a pattern analogy -- a pair of simple patterns to demonstrate the intended edit -- and a learning-based generative model to execute these edits, our method allows users to intuitively edit patterns. To enable this paradigm, we introduce SplitWeave, a domain-specific language that, combined with a framework for sampling synthetic pattern analogies, enables the creation of a large, high-quality synthetic training dataset. We also present TriFuser, a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) designed to overcome critical issues that arise when naively deploying LDMs to this task. Extensive experiments on real-world, artist-sourced patterns reveals that our method faithfully performs the demonstrated edit while also generalizing to related pattern styles beyond its training distribution.</description>

      <title>Prompt Categories Cluster for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which leverages image-level labels, has garnered significant attention due to its cost-effectiveness. The previous methods mainly strengthen the inter-class differences to avoid class semantic ambiguity which may lead to erroneous activation. However, they overlook the positive function of some shared information between similar classes. Categories within the same cluster share some similar features. Allowing the model to recognize these features can further relieve the semantic ambiguity between these classes. To effectively identify and utilize this shared information, in this paper, we introduce a novel WSSS framework called Prompt Categories Clustering (PCC). Specifically, we explore the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive category clusters through prompts. These clusters effectively represent the intrinsic relationships between categories. By integrating this relational information into the training network, our model is able to better learn the hidden connections between categories. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing its ability to enhance performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and surpass existing state-of-the-art methods in WSSS.</description>

      <title>EarthDial: Turning Multi-sensory Earth Observations to Interactive Dialogues</title>

Abstract: Automated analysis of vast Earth observation data via interactive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can unlock new opportunities for environmental monitoring, disaster response, and {resource management}. Existing generic VLMs do not perform well on Remote Sensing data, while the recent Geo-spatial VLMs remain restricted to a fixed resolution and few sensor modalities. In this paper, we introduce EarthDial, a conversational assistant specifically designed for Earth Observation (EO) data, transforming complex, multi-sensory Earth observations into interactive, natural language dialogues. EarthDial supports multi-spectral, multi-temporal, and multi-resolution imagery, enabling a wide range of remote sensing tasks, including classification, detection, captioning, question answering, visual reasoning, and visual grounding. To achieve this, we introduce an extensive instruction tuning dataset comprising over 11.11M instruction pairs covering RGB, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and multispectral modalities such as Near-Infrared (NIR) and infrared. Furthermore, EarthDial handles bi-temporal and multi-temporal sequence analysis for applications like change detection. Our extensive experimental results on 44 downstream datasets demonstrate that EarthDial outperforms existing generic and domain-specific models, achieving better generalization across various EO tasks. Our source codes and pre-trained models are at https://github.com/hiyamdebary/EarthDial.</description>

      <title>Adversarially Domain-adaptive Latent Diffusion for Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation requires extensive pixel-level annotation, motivating unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) to transfer knowledge from labelled source domains to unlabelled or weakly labelled target domains. One of the most efficient strategies involves using synthetic datasets generated within controlled virtual environments, such as video games or traffic simulators, which can automatically generate pixel-level annotations. However, even when such datasets are available, learning a well-generalised representation that captures both domains remains challenging, owing to probabilistic and geometric discrepancies between the virtual world and real-world imagery. This work introduces a semantic segmentation method based on latent diffusion models, termed Inter-Coder Connected Latent Diffusion (ICCLD), alongside an unsupervised domain adaptation approach. The model employs an inter-coder connection to enhance contextual understanding and preserve fine details, while adversarial learning aligns latent feature distributions across domains during the latent diffusion process. Experiments on GTA5, Synthia, and Cityscapes demonstrate that ICCLD outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods, achieving mIoU scores of 74.4 (GTA5$\rightarrow$Cityscapes) and 67.2 (Synthia$\rightarrow$Cityscapes).</description>

      <title>VidCtx: Context-aware Video Question Answering with Image Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address computational and memory limitations of Large Multimodal Models in the Video Question-Answering task, several recent methods extract textual representations per frame (e.g., by captioning) and feed them to a Large Language Model (LLM) that processes them to produce the final response. However, in this way, the LLM does not have access to visual information and often has to process repetitive textual descriptions of nearby frames. To address those shortcomings, in this paper, we introduce VidCtx, a novel training-free VideoQA framework which integrates both modalities, i.e. both visual information from input frames and textual descriptions of others frames that give the appropriate context. More specifically, in the proposed framework a pre-trained Large Multimodal Model (LMM) is prompted to extract at regular intervals, question-aware textual descriptions (captions) of video frames. Those will be used as context when the same LMM will be prompted to answer the question at hand given as input a) a certain frame, b) the question and c) the context/caption of an appropriate frame. To avoid redundant information, we chose as context the descriptions of distant frames. Finally, a simple yet effective max pooling mechanism is used to aggregate the frame-level decisions. This methodology enables the model to focus on the relevant segments of the video and scale to a high number of frames. Experiments show that VidCtx achieves competitive performance among approaches that rely on open models on three public Video QA benchmarks, NExT-QA, IntentQA and STAR. Our code is available at https://github.com/IDT-ITI/VidCtx.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Robustness for Deep Learning-based Wildfire Prediction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapidly growing wildfires have recently devastated societal assets, exposing a critical need for early warning systems to expedite relief efforts. Smoke detection using camera-based Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) offers a promising solution for wildfire prediction. However, the rarity of smoke across time and space limits training data, raising model overfitting and bias concerns. Current DNNs, primarily Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, complicate robustness evaluation due to architectural differences. To address these challenges, we introduce WARP (Wildfire Adversarial Robustness Procedure), the first model-agnostic framework for evaluating wildfire detection models' adversarial robustness. WARP addresses inherent limitations in data diversity by generating adversarial examples through image-global and -local perturbations. Global and local attacks superimpose Gaussian noise and PNG patches onto image inputs, respectively; this suits both CNNs and transformers while generating realistic adversarial scenarios. Using WARP, we assessed real-time CNNs and Transformers, uncovering key vulnerabilities. At times, transformers exhibited over 70% precision degradation under global attacks, while both models generally struggled to differentiate cloud-like PNG patches from real smoke during local attacks. To enhance model robustness, we proposed four wildfire-oriented data augmentation techniques based on WARP's methodology and results, which diversify smoke image data and improve model precision and robustness. These advancements represent a substantial step toward developing a reliable early wildfire warning system, which may be our first safeguard against wildfire destruction.</description>

      <title>MambaVO: Deep Visual Odometry Based on Sequential Matching Refinement and Training Smoothing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep visual odometry has demonstrated great advancements by learning-to-optimize technology. This approach heavily relies on the visual matching across frames. However, ambiguous matching in challenging scenarios leads to significant errors in geometric modeling and bundle adjustment optimization, which undermines the accuracy and robustness of pose estimation. To address this challenge, this paper proposes MambaVO, which conducts robust initialization, Mamba-based sequential matching refinement, and smoothed training to enhance the matching quality and improve the pose estimation. Specifically, the new frame is matched with the closest keyframe in the maintained Point-Frame Graph (PFG) via the semi-dense based Geometric Initialization Module (GIM). Then the initialized PFG is processed by a proposed Geometric Mamba Module (GMM), which exploits the matching features to refine the overall inter-frame matching. The refined PFG is finally processed by differentiable BA to optimize the poses and the map. To deal with the gradient variance, a Trending-Aware Penalty (TAP) is proposed to smooth training and enhance convergence and stability. A loop closure module is finally applied to enable MambaVO++. On public benchmarks, MambaVO and MambaVO++ demonstrate SOTA performance, while ensuring real-time running.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in generative AI, especially diffusion models, has demonstrated significant utility in text-to-image synthesis. Particularly in healthcare, these models offer immense potential in generating synthetic datasets and training medical students. However, despite these strong performances, it remains uncertain if the image generation quality is consistent across different demographic subgroups. To address this critical concern, we present the first comprehensive study on the fairness of medical text-to-image diffusion models. Our extensive evaluations of the popular Stable Diffusion model reveal significant disparities across gender, race, and ethnicity. To mitigate these biases, we introduce FairDiffusion, an equity-aware latent diffusion model that enhances fairness in both image generation quality as well as the semantic correlation of clinical features. In addition, we also design and curate FairGenMed, the first dataset for studying the fairness of medical generative models. Complementing this effort, we further evaluate FairDiffusion on two widely-used external medical datasets: HAM10000 (dermatoscopic images) and CheXpert (chest X-rays) to demonstrate FairDiffusion's effectiveness in addressing fairness concerns across diverse medical imaging modalities. Together, FairDiffusion and FairGenMed significantly advance research in fair generative learning, promoting equitable benefits of generative AI in healthcare.</description>

      <title>PTQ4VM: Post-Training Quantization for Visual Mamba</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual Mamba is an approach that extends the selective space state model, Mamba, to vision tasks. It processes image tokens sequentially in a fixed order, accumulating information to generate outputs. Despite its growing popularity for delivering high-quality outputs at a low computational cost across various tasks, Visual Mamba is highly susceptible to quantization, which makes further performance improvements challenging. Our analysis reveals that the fixed token access order in Visual Mamba introduces unique quantization challenges, which we categorize into three main issues: 1) token-wise variance, 2) channel-wise outliers, and 3) a long tail of activations. To address these challenges, we propose Post-Training Quantization for Visual Mamba (PTQ4VM), which introduces two key strategies: Per-Token Static (PTS) quantization and Joint Learning of Smoothing Scale and Step Size (JLSS). To the our best knowledge, this is the first quantization study on Visual Mamba. PTQ4VM can be applied to various Visual Mamba backbones, converting the pretrained model to a quantized format in under 15 minutes without notable quality degradation. Extensive experiments on large-scale classification and regression tasks demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving up to 1.83x speedup on GPUs with negligible accuracy loss compared to FP16.

      <title>MLLM-as-a-Judge for Image Safety without Human Labeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image content safety has become a significant challenge with the rise of visual media on online platforms. Meanwhile, in the age of AI-generated content (AIGC), many image generation models are capable of producing harmful content, such as images containing sexual or violent material. Thus, it becomes crucial to identify such unsafe images based on established safety rules. Pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer potential in this regard, given their strong pattern recognition abilities. Existing approaches typically fine-tune MLLMs with human-labeled datasets, which however brings a series of drawbacks. First, relying on human annotators to label data following intricate and detailed guidelines is both expensive and labor-intensive. Furthermore, users of safety judgment systems may need to frequently update safety rules, making fine-tuning on human-based annotation more challenging. This raises the research question: Can we detect unsafe images by querying MLLMs in a zero-shot setting using a predefined safety constitution (a set of safety rules)? Our research showed that simply querying pre-trained MLLMs does not yield satisfactory results. This lack of effectiveness stems from factors such as the subjectivity of safety rules, the complexity of lengthy constitutions, and the inherent biases in the models. To address these challenges, we propose a MLLM-based method includes objectifying safety rules, assessing the relevance between rules and images, making quick judgments based on debiased token probabilities with logically complete yet simplified precondition chains for safety rules, and conducting more in-depth reasoning with cascaded chain-of-thought processes if necessary. Experiment results demonstrate that our method is highly effective for zero-shot image safety judgment tasks.</description>

      <title>eKalibr: Dynamic Intrinsic Calibration for Event Cameras From First Principles of Events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bio-inspired event camera has garnered extensive research attention in recent years, owing to its significant potential derived from its high dynamic range and low latency characteristics. Similar to the standard camera, the event camera requires precise intrinsic calibration to facilitate further high-level visual applications, such as pose estimation and mapping. While several calibration methods for event cameras have been proposed, most of them are either (i) engineering-driven, heavily relying on conventional image-based calibration pipelines, or (ii) inconvenient, requiring complex instrumentation. To this end, we propose an accurate and convenient intrinsic calibration method for event cameras, named eKalibr, which builds upon a carefully designed event-based circle grid pattern recognition algorithm. To extract target patterns from events, we perform event-based normal flow estimation to identify potential events generated by circle edges, and cluster them spatially. Subsequently, event clusters associated with the same grid circles are matched and grouped using normal flows, for subsequent time-varying ellipse estimation. Fitted ellipse centers are time-synchronized, for final grid pattern recognition. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of eKalibr in terms of pattern extraction and intrinsic calibration. The implementation of eKalibr is open-sourced at (https://github.com/Unsigned-Long/eKalibr) to benefit the research community.</description>

      <title>Leveraging GANs For Active Appearance Models Optimized Model Fitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active Appearance Models (AAMs) are a well-established technique for fitting deformable models to images, but they are limited by linear appearance assumptions and can struggle with complex variations. In this paper, we explore if the AAM fitting process can benefit from a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We uses a U-Net based generator and a PatchGAN discriminator for GAN-augmented framework in an attempt to refine the appearance model during fitting. This approach attempts to addresses challenges such as non-linear appearance variations and occlusions that traditional AAM optimization methods may fail to handle. Limited experiments on face alignment datasets demonstrate that the GAN-enhanced AAM can achieve higher accuracy and faster convergence than classic approaches with some manual interventions. These results establish feasibility of GANs as a tool for improving deformable model fitting in challenging conditions while maintaining efficient performance, and establishes the need for more future work to evaluate this approach at scale.</description>

Abstract: Tea flowers play a crucial role in taxonomic research and hybrid breeding for the tea plant. As traditional methods of observing tea flower traits are labor-intensive and inaccurate, we propose TflosYOLO and TFSC model for tea flowering quantifying, which enable estimation of flower count and flowering period. In this study, a highly representative and diverse dataset was constructed by collecting flower images from 29 tea accessions in 2 years. Based on this dataset, the TflosYOLO model was built on the YOLOv5 architecture and enhanced with the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) network, which is the first model to offer a viable solution for detecting and counting tea flowers. The TflosYOLO model achieved an mAP50 of 0.874, outperforming YOLOv5, YOLOv7 and YOLOv8. Furthermore, TflosYOLO model was tested on 34 datasets encompassing 26 tea accessions, five flowering stages, various lighting conditions, and pruned / unpruned plants, demonstrating high generalization and robustness. The correlation coefficient (R^2) between the predicted and actual flower counts was 0.974. Additionally, the TFSC (Tea Flowering Stage Classification) model, a 7-layer neural network was designed for automatic classification of the flowering period. TFSC model was evaluated on 2 years and achieved an accuracy of 0.738 and 0.899 respectively. Using the TflosYOLO+TFSC model, we monitored the tea flowering dynamics and tracked the changes in flowering stages across various tea accessions. The framework provides crucial support for tea plant breeding programs and phenotypic analysis of germplasm resources.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Dynamic Clustering and Contrastive Refinement for Gait Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gait recognition is an emerging identification technology that distinguishes individuals at long distances by analyzing individual walking patterns. Traditional techniques rely heavily on large-scale labeled datasets, which incurs high costs and significant labeling challenges. Recently, researchers have explored unsupervised gait recognition with clustering-based unsupervised domain adaptation methods and achieved notable success. However, these methods directly use pseudo-label generated by clustering and neglect pseudolabel noise caused by domain differences, which affects the effect of the model training process. To mitigate these issues, we proposed a novel model called GaitDCCR, which aims to reduce the influence of noisy pseudo labels on clustering and model training. Our approach can be divided into two main stages: clustering and training stage. In the clustering stage, we propose Dynamic Cluster Parameters (DCP) and Dynamic Weight Centroids (DWC) to improve the efficiency of clustering and obtain reliable cluster centroids. In the training stage, we employ the classical teacher-student structure and propose Confidence-based Pseudo-label Refinement (CPR) and Contrastive Teacher Module (CTM) to encourage noisy samples to converge towards clusters containing their true identities. Extensive experiments on public gait datasets have demonstrated that our simple and effective method significantly enhances the performance of unsupervised gait recognition, laying the foundation for its application in the real-world. We will release the code at https://github.com/YanSun-github/GaitDCCR upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Scenario Understanding of Traffic Scenes Through Large Visual Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning models for autonomous driving, encompassing perception, planning, and control, depend on vast datasets to achieve their high performance. However, their generalization often suffers due to domain-specific data distributions, making an effective scene-based categorization of samples necessary to improve their reliability across diverse domains. Manual captioning, though valuable, is both labor-intensive and time-consuming, creating a bottleneck in the data annotation process. Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) present a compelling solution by automating image analysis and categorization through contextual queries, often without requiring retraining for new categories. In this study, we evaluate the capabilities of LVLMs, including GPT-4 and LLaVA, to understand and classify urban traffic scenes on both an in-house dataset and the BDD100K. We propose a scalable captioning pipeline that integrates state-of-the-art models, enabling a flexible deployment on new datasets. Our analysis, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative insights, demonstrates the effectiveness of LVLMs to understand urban traffic scenarios and highlights their potential as an efficient tool for data-driven advancements in autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Neural Networks for Intelligent Data-Driven Development</title>

Abstract: Advances in machine learning methods for computer vision tasks have led to their consideration for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. However, effectively integrating these methods into the automotive development lifecycle remains challenging. Since the performance of machine learning algorithms relies heavily on the training data provided, the data and model development lifecycle play a key role in successfully integrating these components into the product development lifecycle. Existing models frequently encounter difficulties recognizing or adapting to novel instances not present in the original training dataset. This poses a significant risk for reliable deployment in dynamic environments. To address this challenge, we propose an adaptive neural network architecture and an iterative development framework that enables users to efficiently incorporate previously unknown objects into the current perception system. Our approach builds on continuous learning, emphasizing the necessity of dynamic updates to reflect real-world deployment conditions. Specifically, we introduce a pipeline with three key components: (1) a scalable network extension strategy to integrate new classes while preserving existing performance, (2) a dynamic OoD detection component that requires no additional retraining for newly added classes, and (3) a retrieval-based data augmentation process tailored for safety-critical deployments. The integration of these components establishes a pragmatic and adaptive pipeline for the continuous evolution of perception systems in the context of autonomous driving.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: You Look Only Once (YOLO) models have been widely used for building real-time object detectors across various domains. With the increasing frequency of new YOLO versions being released, key questions arise. Are the newer versions always better than their previous versions? What are the core innovations in each YOLO version and how do these changes translate into real-world performance gains? In this paper, we summarize the key innovations from YOLOv1 to YOLOv11, introduce a comprehensive benchmark called ODverse33, which includes 33 datasets spanning 11 diverse domains (Autonomous driving, Agricultural, Underwater, Medical, Videogame, Industrial, Aerial, Wildlife, Retail, Microscopic, and Security), and explore the practical impact of model improvements in real-world, multi-domain applications through extensive experimental results. We hope this study can provide some guidance to the extensive users of object detection models and give some references for future real-time object detector development.</description>

      <title>CrossOver: 3D Scene Cross-Modal Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-modal 3D object understanding has gained significant attention, yet current approaches often assume complete data availability and rigid alignment across all modalities. We present CrossOver, a novel framework for cross-modal 3D scene understanding via flexible, scene-level modality alignment. Unlike traditional methods that require aligned modality data for every object instance, CrossOver learns a unified, modality-agnostic embedding space for scenes by aligning modalities -- RGB images, point clouds, CAD models, floorplans, and text descriptions -- with relaxed constraints and without explicit object semantics. Leveraging dimensionality-specific encoders, a multi-stage training pipeline, and emergent cross-modal behaviors, CrossOver supports robust scene retrieval and object localization, even with missing modalities. Evaluations on ScanNet and 3RScan datasets show its superior performance across diverse metrics, highlighting the adaptability for real-world applications in 3D scene understanding.</description>

      <title>Forgotten Polygons: Multimodal Large Language Models are Shape-Blind</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite strong performance on vision-language tasks, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with mathematical problem-solving, with both open-source and state-of-the-art models falling short of human performance on visual-math benchmarks. To systematically examine visual-mathematical reasoning in MLLMs, we (1) evaluate their understanding of geometric primitives, (2) test multi-step reasoning, and (3) explore a potential solution to improve visual reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental shortcomings in shape recognition, with top models achieving under 50% accuracy in identifying regular polygons. We analyze these failures through the lens of dual-process theory and show that MLLMs rely on System 1 (intuitive, memorized associations) rather than System 2 (deliberate reasoning). Consequently, MLLMs fail to count the sides of both familiar and novel shapes, suggesting they have neither learned the concept of sides nor effectively process visual inputs. Finally, we propose Visually Cued Chain-of-Thought (VC-CoT) prompting, which enhances multi-step mathematical reasoning by explicitly referencing visual annotations in diagrams, boosting GPT-4o's accuracy on an irregular polygon side-counting task from 7% to 93%. Our findings suggest that System 2 reasoning in MLLMs remains an open problem, and visually-guided prompting is essential for successfully engaging visual reasoning.

      <title>CalibRefine: Deep Learning-Based Online Automatic Targetless LiDAR-Camera Calibration with Iterative and Attention-Driven Post-Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17648v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate multi-sensor calibration is essential for deploying robust perception systems in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and intelligent transportation. Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods often rely on manually placed targets, preliminary parameter estimates, or intensive data preprocessing, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online calibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point clouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a Common Feature Discriminator that trains on automatically detected objects--using relative positions, appearance embeddings, and semantic classes--to generate reliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based calibration, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally improve alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an attention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging a Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on two urban traffic datasets, we show that CalibRefine delivers high-precision calibration results with minimal human involvement, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless methods and remaining competitive with, or surpassing, manually tuned baselines. Our findings highlight how robust object-level feature matching, together with iterative and self-supervised attention-based adjustments, enables consistent sensor fusion in complex, real-world conditions without requiring ground-truth calibration matrices or elaborate data preprocessing.

      <title>Show and Tell: Visually Explainable Deep Neural Nets via Spatially-Aware Concept Bottleneck Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern deep neural networks have now reached human-level performance across a variety of tasks. However, unlike humans they lack the ability to explain their decisions by showing where and telling what concepts guided them. In this work, we present a unified framework for transforming any vision neural network into a spatially and conceptually interpretable model. We introduce a spatially-aware concept bottleneck layer that projects "black-box" features of pre-trained backbone models into interpretable concept maps, without requiring human labels. By training a classification layer over this bottleneck, we obtain a self-explaining model that articulates which concepts most influenced its prediction, along with heatmaps that ground them in the input image. Accordingly, we name this method "Spatially-Aware and Label-Free Concept Bottleneck Model" (SALF-CBM). Our results show that the proposed SALF-CBM: (1) Outperforms non-spatial CBM methods, as well as the original backbone, on a variety of classification tasks; (2) Produces high-quality spatial explanations, outperforming widely used heatmap-based methods on a zero-shot segmentation task; (3) Facilitates model exploration and debugging, enabling users to query specific image regions and refine the model's decisions by locally editing its concept maps.</description>

      <title>STPro: Spatial and Temporal Progressive Learning for Weakly Supervised Spatio-Temporal Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study Weakly Supervised Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (WSTVG), a challenging task of localizing subjects spatio-temporally in videos using only textual queries and no bounding box supervision. Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</description>

      <title>Less is More? Revisiting the Importance of Frame Rate in Real-Time Zero-Shot Surgical Video Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time video segmentation is a promising feature for AI-assisted surgery, providing intraoperative guidance by identifying surgical tools and anatomical structures. However, deploying state-of-the-art segmentation models, such as SAM2, in real-time settings is computationally demanding, which makes it essential to balance frame rate and segmentation performance. In this study, we investigate the impact of frame rate on zero-shot surgical video segmentation, evaluating SAM2's effectiveness across multiple frame sampling rates for cholecystectomy procedures. Surprisingly, our findings indicate that in conventional evaluation settings, frame rates as low as a single frame per second can outperform 25 FPS, as fewer frames smooth out segmentation inconsistencies. However, when assessed in a real-time streaming scenario, higher frame rates yield superior temporal coherence and stability, particularly for dynamic objects such as surgical graspers. Finally, we investigate human perception of real-time surgical video segmentation among professionals who work closely with such data and find that respondents consistently prefer high FPS segmentation mask overlays, reinforcing the importance of real-time evaluation in AI-assisted surgery.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Video Scene Graph Generation via Visual and Semantic Dual Debiasing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to capture dynamic relationships among entities by sequentially analyzing video frames and integrating visual and semantic information. However, VidSGG is challenged by significant biases that skew predictions. To mitigate these biases, we propose a VIsual and Semantic Awareness (VISA) framework for unbiased VidSGG. VISA addresses visual bias through memory-enhanced temporal integration that enhances object representations and concurrently reduces semantic bias by iteratively integrating object features with comprehensive semantic information derived from triplet relationships. This visual-semantics dual debiasing approach results in more unbiased representations of complex scene dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where VISA outperforms existing unbiased VidSGG approaches by a substantial margin (e.g., +13.1% improvement in mR@20 and mR@50 for the SGCLS task under Semi Constraint).</description>

      <title>Enhancing Retinal Vessel Segmentation Generalization via Layout-Aware Generative Modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalization in medical segmentation models is challenging due to limited annotated datasets and imaging variability. To address this, we propose Retinal Layout-Aware Diffusion (RLAD), a novel diffusion-based framework for generating controllable layout-aware images. RLAD conditions image generation on multiple key layout components extracted from real images, ensuring high structural fidelity while enabling diversity in other components. Applied to retinal fundus imaging, we augmented the training datasets by synthesizing paired retinal images and vessel segmentations conditioned on extracted blood vessels from real images, while varying other layout components such as lesions and the optic disc. Experiments demonstrated that RLAD-generated data improved generalization in retinal vessel segmentation by up to 8.1%. Furthermore, we present REYIA, a comprehensive dataset comprising 586 manually segmented retinal images. To foster reproducibility and drive innovation, both our code and dataset will be made publicly accessible.</description>

      <title>Mocap-2-to-3: Lifting 2D Diffusion-Based Pretrained Models for 3D Motion Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recovering absolute poses in the world coordinate system from monocular views presents significant challenges. Two primary issues arise in this context. Firstly, existing methods rely on 3D motion data for training, which requires collection in limited environments. Acquiring such 3D labels for new actions in a timely manner is impractical, severely restricting the model's generalization capabilities. In contrast, 2D poses are far more accessible and easier to obtain. Secondly, estimating a person's absolute position in metric space from a single viewpoint is inherently more complex. To address these challenges, we introduce Mocap-2-to-3, a novel framework that decomposes intricate 3D motions into 2D poses, leveraging 2D data to enhance 3D motion reconstruction in diverse scenarios and accurately predict absolute positions in the world coordinate system. We initially pretrain a single-view diffusion model with extensive 2D data, followed by fine-tuning a multi-view diffusion model for view consistency using publicly available 3D data. This strategy facilitates the effective use of large-scale 2D data. Additionally, we propose an innovative human motion representation that decouples local actions from global movements and encodes geometric priors of the ground, ensuring the generative model learns accurate motion priors from 2D data. During inference, this allows for the gradual recovery of global movements, resulting in more plausible positioning. We evaluate our model's performance on real-world datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy in motion and absolute human positioning compared to state-of-the-art methods, along with enhanced generalization and scalability. Our code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Advancing Multimodal In-Context Learning in Large Vision-Language Models with Task-aware Demonstrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a key capability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), driven by their increasing scale and applicability. Despite its promise, effective ICL in the multimodal setting remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of image-text inputs and the high sensitivity of ICL performance to input configurations. In this work, we shed light on the core mechanism underlying multimodal ICL, identifying task mapping as a crucial factor in configuring robust in-context demonstration (ICD) sequences. Building on these insights, we propose \textit{SabER}, a lightweight yet powerful decoder-only transformer equipped with task-aware attention, which intelligently selects and arranges ICDs from a demonstration library in an autoregressive fashion. This design enables fine-grained feature extraction and cross-modal reasoning, iteratively refining task mapping to generate high-quality ICD sequences. Through extensive experiments covering five LVLMs and nine benchmark datasets, SabER not only demonstrates strong empirical performance, but also provides deeper understanding of how task semantics interact with multimodal ICDs. Our findings highlight the importance of principled ICD sequence configuration and open new avenues to enhance multimodal ICL in a wide range of real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Transformer-Based Vision-Language Models for Robust Object Detection in Unstructured Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in artificial intelli-gence, capable of integrating textual and visual data for a unified understanding of complex scenes. While models such as Florence2, built on transformer architectures, have shown promise across general tasks, their performance in object detection within unstructured or cluttered environments remains underexplored. In this study, we fi-ne-tuned the Florence2 model for object detection tasks in non-constructed, complex environments. A comprehensive experimental framework was established involving multiple hardware configurations (NVIDIA T4, L4, and A100 GPUs), optimizers (AdamW, SGD), and varied hyperparameters including learning rates and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) setups. Model training and evaluation were conducted on challenging datasets representative of real-world, disordered settings. The optimized Florence2 models exhibited significant improvements in object detection accuracy, with Mean Average Precision (mAP) metrics approaching or matching those of estab-lished models such as YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10. The integration of LoRA and careful fine-tuning of transformer layers contributed notably to these gains. Our find-ings highlight the adaptability of transformer-based VLMs like Florence2 for do-main-specific tasks, particularly in visually complex environments. The study under-scores the potential of fine-tuned VLMs to rival traditional convolution-based detec-tors, offering a flexible and scalable approach for advanced vision applications in re-al-world, unstructured settings.</description>

Abstract: Visual instruction tuning (VIT) for large vision-language models (LVLMs) requires training on expansive datasets of image-instruction pairs, which can be costly. Recent efforts in VIT data selection aim to select a small subset of high-quality image-instruction pairs, reducing VIT runtime while maintaining performance comparable to full-scale training. However, a major challenge often overlooked is that generating instructions from unlabeled images for VIT is highly expensive. Most existing VIT datasets rely heavily on human annotations or paid services like the GPT API, which limits users with constrained resources from creating VIT datasets for custom applications. To address this, we introduce Pre-Instruction Data Selection (PreSel), a more practical data selection paradigm that directly selects the most beneficial unlabeled images and generates instructions only for the selected images. PreSel first estimates the relative importance of each vision task within VIT datasets to derive task-wise sampling budgets. It then clusters image features within each task, selecting the most representative images with the budget. This approach reduces computational overhead for both instruction generation during VIT data formation and LVLM fine-tuning. By generating instructions for only 15% of the images, PreSel achieves performance comparable to full-data VIT on the LLaVA-1.5 and Vision-Flan datasets.

      <title>AR-1-to-3: Single Image to Consistent 3D Object Generation via Next-View Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) is a cornerstone for image-to-3d creation. However, existing works still struggle to maintain consistency between the generated views and the input views, especially when there is a significant camera pose difference, leading to poor-quality 3D geometries and textures. We attribute this issue to their treatment of all target views with equal priority according to our empirical observation that the target views closer to the input views exhibit higher fidelity. With this inspiration, we propose AR-1-to-3, a novel next-view prediction paradigm based on diffusion models that first generates views close to the input views, which are then utilized as contextual information to progressively synthesize farther views. To encode the generated view subsequences as local and global conditions for the next-view prediction, we accordingly develop a stacked local feature encoding strategy (Stacked-LE) and an LSTM-based global feature encoding strategy (LSTM-GE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the consistency between the generated views and the input views, producing high-fidelity 3D assets.</description>

      <title>Less Biased Noise Scale Estimation for Threshold-Robust RANSAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gold-standard for robustly estimating relative pose through image matching is RANSAC. While RANSAC is powerful, it requires setting the inlier threshold that determines whether the error of a correspondence under an estimated model is sufficiently small to be included in its consensus set. Setting this threshold is typically done by hand, and is difficult to tune without an access to ground truth data. Thus, a method capable of automatically determining the optimal threshold would be desirable. In this paper we revisit inlier noise scale estimation, which is an attractive approach as the inlier noise scale is linear to the optimal threshold. We revisit the noise scale estimation method SIMFIT and find bias in the estimate of the noise scale. In particular, we fix underestimates from using the same data for fitting the model as estimating the inlier noise, and from not taking the threshold itself into account. Secondly, since the optimal threshold within a scene is approximately constant we propose a multi-pair extension of SIMFIT++, by filtering of estimates, which improves results. Our approach yields robust performance across a range of thresholds, shown in Figure 1. Code is available at https://github.com/Parskatt/simfitpp</description>

      <title>SpaceVLLM: Endowing Multimodal Large Language Model with Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in either temporal or spatial localization. However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, datasets and model will be released.</description>

      <title>Redefining non-IID Data in Federated Learning for Computer Vision Tasks: Migrating from Labels to Embeddings for Task-Specific Data Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) represents a paradigm shift in distributed machine learning (ML), enabling clients to train models collaboratively while keeping their raw data private. This paradigm shift from traditional centralized ML introduces challenges due to the non-iid (non-independent and identically distributed) nature of data across clients, significantly impacting FL's performance. Existing literature, predominantly model data heterogeneity by imposing label distribution skew across clients. In this paper, we show that label distribution skew fails to fully capture the real-world data heterogeneity among clients in computer vision tasks beyond classification. Subsequently, we demonstrate that current approaches overestimate FL's performance by relying on label/class distribution skew, exposing an overlooked gap in the literature. By utilizing pre-trained deep neural networks to extract task-specific data embeddings, we define task-specific data heterogeneity through the lens of each vision task and introduce a new level of data heterogeneity called embedding-based data heterogeneity. Our methodology involves clustering data points based on embeddings and distributing them among clients using the Dirichlet distribution. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate the performance of different FL methods under our revamped notion of data heterogeneity, introducing new benchmark performance measures to the literature. We further unveil a series of open research directions that can be pursued.</description>

      <title>Strong Baseline: Multi-UAV Tracking via YOLOv12 with BoT-SORT-ReID</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting and tracking multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in thermal infrared video is inherently challenging due to low contrast, environmental noise, and small target sizes. This paper provides a straightforward approach to address multi-UAV tracking in thermal infrared video, leveraging recent advances in detection and tracking. Instead of relying on the well-established YOLOv5 with DeepSORT combination, we present a tracking framework built on YOLOv12 and BoT-SORT, enhanced with tailored training and inference strategies. We evaluate our approach following the 4th Anti-UAV Challenge metrics and reach competitive performance. Notably, we achieved strong results without using contrast enhancement or temporal information fusion to enrich UAV features, highlighting our approach as a "Strong Baseline" for multi-UAV tracking tasks. We provide implementation details, in-depth experimental analysis, and a discussion of potential improvements.

      <title>Benchmarking Multi-modal Semantic Segmentation under Sensor Failures: Missing and Noisy Modality Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-modal semantic segmentation (MMSS) addresses the limitations of single-modality data by integrating complementary information across modalities. Despite notable progress, a significant gap persists between research and real-world deployment due to variability and uncertainty in multi-modal data quality. Robustness has thus become essential for practical MMSS applications. However, the absence of standardized benchmarks for evaluating robustness hinders further advancement. To address this, we first survey existing MMSS literature and categorize representative methods to provide a structured overview. We then introduce a robustness benchmark that evaluates MMSS models under three scenarios: Entire-Missing Modality (EMM), Random-Missing Modality (RMM), and Noisy Modality (NM). From a probabilistic standpoint, we model modality failure under two conditions: (1) all damaged combinations are equally probable; (2) each modality fails independently following a Bernoulli distribution. Based on these, we propose four metrics-$mIoU^{Avg}_{EMM}$, $mIoU^{E}_{EMM}$, $mIoU^{Avg}_{RMM}$, and $mIoU^{E}_{RMM}$-to assess model robustness under EMM and RMM. This work provides the first dedicated benchmark for MMSS robustness, offering new insights and tools to advance the field.

      <title>Disentangled Source-Free Personalization for Facial Expression Recognition with Neutral Target Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20771v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) from videos is a crucial task in various application areas, such as human-computer interaction and health monitoring (e.g., pain, depression, fatigue, and stress). Beyond the challenges of recognizing subtle emotional or health states, the effectiveness of deep FER models is often hindered by the considerable variability of expressions among subjects. Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) methods are employed to adapt a pre-trained source model using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy and storage issues. Typically, SFDA methods adapt to a target domain dataset corresponding to an entire population and assume it includes data from all recognition classes. However, collecting such comprehensive target data can be difficult or even impossible for FER in healthcare applications. In many real-world scenarios, it may be feasible to collect a short neutral control video (displaying only neutral expressions) for target subjects before deployment. These videos can be used to adapt a model to better handle the variability of expressions among subjects. This paper introduces the Disentangled Source-Free Domain Adaptation (DSFDA) method to address the SFDA challenge posed by missing target expression data. DSFDA leverages data from a neutral target control video for end-to-end generation and adaptation of target data with missing non-neutral data. Our method learns to disentangle features related to expressions and identity while generating the missing non-neutral target data, thereby enhancing model accuracy. Additionally, our self-supervision strategy improves model adaptation by reconstructing target images that maintain the same identity and source expression. Experimental results on the challenging BioVid and UNBC-McMaster pain datasets indicate that our DSFDA approach can outperform state-of-the-art adaptation method.</description>

      <title>Parametric Shadow Control for Portrait Generation in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse portraits, but lack intuitive shadow control. Existing editing approaches, as post-processing, struggle to offer effective manipulation across diverse styles. Additionally, these methods either rely on expensive real-world light-stage data collection or require extensive computational resources for training. To address these limitations, we introduce Shadow Director, a method that extracts and manipulates hidden shadow attributes within well-trained diffusion models. Our approach uses a small estimation network that requires only a few thousand synthetic images and hours of training-no costly real-world light-stage data needed. Shadow Director enables parametric and intuitive control over shadow shape, placement, and intensity during portrait generation while preserving artistic integrity and identity across diverse styles. Despite training only on synthetic data built on real-world identities, it generalizes effectively to generated portraits with diverse styles, making it a more accessible and resource-friendly solution.</description>

      <title>CoGen: 3D Consistent Video Generation via Adaptive Conditioning for Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in driving video generation has shown significant potential for enhancing self-driving systems by providing scalable and controllable training data. Although pretrained state-of-the-art generation models, guided by 2D layout conditions (e.g., HD maps and bounding boxes), can produce photorealistic driving videos, achieving controllable multi-view videos with high 3D consistency remains a major challenge. To tackle this, we introduce a novel spatial adaptive generation framework, CoGen, which leverages advances in 3D generation to improve performance in two key aspects: (i) To ensure 3D consistency, we first generate high-quality, controllable 3D conditions that capture the geometry of driving scenes. By replacing coarse 2D conditions with these fine-grained 3D representations, our approach significantly enhances the spatial consistency of the generated videos. (ii) Additionally, we introduce a consistency adapter module to strengthen the robustness of the model to multi-condition control. The results demonstrate that this method excels in preserving geometric fidelity and visual realism, offering a reliable video generation solution for autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>SIGHT: Single-Image Conditioned Generation of Hand Trajectories for Hand-Object Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel task of generating realistic and diverse 3D hand trajectories given a single image of an object, which could be involved in a hand-object interaction scene or pictured by itself. When humans grasp an object, appropriate trajectories naturally form in our minds to use it for specific tasks. Hand-object interaction trajectory priors can greatly benefit applications in robotics, embodied AI, augmented reality and related fields. However, synthesizing realistic and appropriate hand trajectories given a single object or hand-object interaction image is a highly ambiguous task, requiring to correctly identify the object of interest and possibly even the correct interaction among many possible alternatives. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose the SIGHT-Fusion system, consisting of a curated pipeline for extracting visual features of hand-object interaction details from egocentric videos involving object manipulation, and a diffusion-based conditional motion generation model processing the extracted features. We train our method given video data with corresponding hand trajectory annotations, without supervision in the form of action labels. For the evaluation, we establish benchmarks utilizing the first-person FPHAB and HOI4D datasets, testing our method against various baselines and using multiple metrics. We also introduce task simulators for executing the generated hand trajectories and reporting task success rates as an additional metric. Experiments show that our method generates more appropriate and realistic hand trajectories than baselines and presents promising generalization capability on unseen objects. The accuracy of the generated hand trajectories is confirmed in a physics simulation setting, showcasing the authenticity of the created sequences and their applicability in downstream uses.</description>

      <title>FastVAR: Linear Visual Autoregressive Modeling via Cached Token Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling has gained popularity for its shift towards next-scale prediction. However, existing VAR paradigms process the entire token map at each scale step, leading to the complexity and runtime scaling dramatically with image resolution. To address this challenge, we propose FastVAR, a post-training acceleration method for efficient resolution scaling with VARs. Our key finding is that the majority of latency arises from the large-scale step where most tokens have already converged. Leveraging this observation, we develop the cached token pruning strategy that only forwards pivotal tokens for scale-specific modeling while using cached tokens from previous scale steps to restore the pruned slots. This significantly reduces the number of forwarded tokens and improves the efficiency at larger resolutions. Experiments show the proposed FastVAR can further speedup FlashAttention-accelerated VAR by 2.7$\times$ with negligible performance drop of &lt;1%. We further extend FastVAR to zero-shot generation of higher resolution images. In particular, FastVAR can generate one 2K image with 15GB memory footprints in 1.5s on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code is available at https://github.com/csguoh/FastVAR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the representation shift on Vision Language Models like CLIP under different augmentations provides valuable insights on Mechanistic Interpretability. In this study, we show the shift on CLIP's embeddings on 9 common augmentation techniques: noise, blur, color jitter, scale and rotate, flip, elastic and perspective transforms, random brightness and contrast, and coarse dropout of pixel blocks. We scrutinize the embedding shifts under similarity on attention map, patch, edge, detail preservation, cosine similarity, L2 distance, pairwise distance and dendrogram clusters and provide qualitative analysis on sample images. Our findings suggest certain augmentations like noise, perspective transform and shift scaling have higher degree of drastic impact on embedding shift. This study provides a concrete foundation for future work on VLM's robustness for mechanical interpretation and adversarial data defense.</description>

      <title>Safeguarding Vision-Language Models: Mitigating Vulnerabilities to Gaussian Noise in Perturbation-based Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) extend the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating visual information, yet they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, especially when processing noisy or corrupted images. Although existing VLMs adopt security measures during training to mitigate such attacks, vulnerabilities associated with noise-augmented visual inputs are overlooked. In this work, we identify that missing noise-augmented training causes critical security gaps: many VLMs are susceptible to even simple perturbations such as Gaussian noise. To address this challenge, we propose Robust-VLGuard, a multimodal safety dataset with aligned / misaligned image-text pairs, combined with noise-augmented fine-tuning that reduces attack success rates while preserving functionality of VLM. For stronger optimization-based visual perturbation attacks, we propose DiffPure-VLM, leveraging diffusion models to convert adversarial perturbations into Gaussian-like noise, which can be defended by VLMs with noise-augmented safety fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the distribution-shifting property of diffusion model aligns well with our fine-tuned VLMs, significantly mitigating adversarial perturbations across varying intensities.

      <title>Memory-efficient Low-latency Remote Photoplethysmography through Temporal-Spatial State Space Duality</title>

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), enabling non-contact physiological monitoring through facial light reflection analysis, faces critical computational bottlenecks as deep learning introduces performance gains at the cost of prohibitive resource demands. This paper proposes ME-rPPG, a memory-efficient algorithm built on temporal-spatial state space duality, which resolves the trilemma of model scalability, cross-dataset generalization, and real-time constraints. Leveraging a transferable state space, ME-rPPG efficiently captures subtle periodic variations across facial frames while maintaining minimal computational overhead, enabling training on extended video sequences and supporting low-latency inference. Achieving cross-dataset MAEs of 5.38 (MMPD), 0.70 (VitalVideo), and 0.25 (PURE), ME-rPPG outperforms all baselines with improvements ranging from 21.3% to 60.2%. Our solution enables real-time inference with only 3.6 MB memory usage and 9.46 ms latency -- surpassing existing methods by 19.5%-49.7% accuracy and 43.2% user satisfaction gains in real-world deployments. The code and demos are released for reproducibility on https://health-hci-group.github.io/ME-rPPG-demo/.</description>

      <title>Is Temporal Prompting All We Need For Limited Labeled Action Recognition?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video understanding has shown remarkable improvements in recent years, largely dependent on the availability of large scaled labeled datasets. Recent advancements in visual-language models, especially based on contrastive pretraining, have shown remarkable generalization in zero-shot tasks, helping to overcome this dependence on labeled datasets. Adaptations of such models for videos, typically involve modifying the architecture of vision-language models to cater to video data. However, this is not trivial, since such adaptations are mostly computationally intensive and struggle with temporal modeling. We present TP-CLIP, an adaptation of CLIP that leverages temporal visual prompting for temporal adaptation without modifying the core CLIP architecture. This preserves its generalization abilities. TP-CLIP efficiently integrates into the CLIP architecture, leveraging its pre-trained capabilities for video data. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate its efficacy in zero-shot and few-shot learning, outperforming existing approaches with fewer parameters and computational efficiency. In particular, we use just 1/3 the GFLOPs and 1/28 the number of tuneable parameters in comparison to recent state-of-the-art and still outperform it by up to 15.8% depending on the task and dataset.</description>

      <title>Re-thinking Temporal Search for Long-Form Video Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge in computer vision. In this work, we revisit temporal search paradigms for long-form video understanding and address a fundamental issue pertaining to all state-of-the-art (SOTA) long-context vision-language models (VLMs). Our contributions are twofold: First, we frame temporal search as a Long Video Haystack problem: finding a minimal set of relevant frames (e.g., one to five) from tens of thousands based on specific queries. Upon this formulation, we introduce LV-Haystack, the first dataset with 480 hours of videos, 15,092 human-annotated instances for both training and evaluation aiming to improve temporal search quality and efficiency. Results on LV-Haystack highlight a significant research gap in temporal search capabilities, with current SOTA search methods only achieving 2.1% temporal F1 score on the Longvideobench subset. Next, inspired by visual search in images, we propose a lightweight temporal search framework, T* that reframes costly temporal search as spatial search. T* leverages powerful visual localization techniques commonly used in images and introduces an adaptive zooming-in mechanism that operates across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments show that integrating T* with existing methods significantly improves SOTA long-form video understanding. Under an inference budget of 32 frames, T* improves GPT-4o's performance from 50.5% to 53.1% and LLaVA-OneVision-OV-72B's performance from 56.5% to 62.4% on the Longvideobench XL subset. Our code, benchmark, and models are provided in the Supplementary material.</description>

      <title>MultiTSF: Transformer-based Sensor Fusion for Human-Centric Multi-view and Multi-modal Action Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Action recognition from multi-modal and multi-view observations holds significant potential for applications in surveillance, robotics, and smart environments. However, existing methods often fall short of addressing real-world challenges such as diverse environmental conditions, strict sensor synchronization, and the need for fine-grained annotations. In this study, we propose the Multi-modal Multi-view Transformer-based Sensor Fusion (MultiTSF). The proposed method leverages a Transformer-based to dynamically model inter-view relationships and capture temporal dependencies across multiple views. Additionally, we introduce a Human Detection Module to generate pseudo-ground-truth labels, enabling the model to prioritize frames containing human activity and enhance spatial feature learning. Comprehensive experiments conducted on our in-house MultiSensor-Home dataset and the existing MM-Office dataset demonstrate that MultiTSF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both video sequence-level and frame-level action recognition settings.</description>

      <title>Audio-visual Controlled Video Diffusion with Masked Selective State Spaces Modeling for Natural Talking Head Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Talking head synthesis is vital for virtual avatars and human-computer interaction. However, most existing methods are typically limited to accepting control from a single primary modality, restricting their practical utility. To this end, we introduce \textbf{ACTalker}, an end-to-end video diffusion framework that supports both multi-signals control and single-signal control for talking head video generation. For multiple control, we design a parallel mamba structure with multiple branches, each utilizing a separate driving signal to control specific facial regions. A gate mechanism is applied across all branches, providing flexible control over video generation. To ensure natural coordination of the controlled video both temporally and spatially, we employ the mamba structure, which enables driving signals to manipulate feature tokens across both dimensions in each branch. Additionally, we introduce a mask-drop strategy that allows each driving signal to independently control its corresponding facial region within the mamba structure, preventing control conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces natural-looking facial videos driven by diverse signals and that the mamba layer seamlessly integrates multiple driving modalities without conflict.

      <title>Towards Understanding How Knowledge Evolves in Large Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are gradually becoming the foundation for many artificial intelligence applications. However, understanding their internal working mechanisms has continued to puzzle researchers, which in turn limits the further enhancement of their capabilities. In this paper, we seek to investigate how multimodal knowledge evolves and eventually induces natural languages in LVLMs. We design a series of novel strategies for analyzing internal knowledge within LVLMs, and delve into the evolution of multimodal knowledge from three levels, including single token probabilities, token probability distributions, and feature encodings. In this process, we identify two key nodes in knowledge evolution: the critical layers and the mutation layers, dividing the evolution process into three stages: rapid evolution, stabilization, and mutation. Our research is the first to reveal the trajectory of knowledge evolution in LVLMs, providing a fresh perspective for understanding their underlying mechanisms.

      <title>NuScenes-SpatialQA: A Spatial Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark for Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for autonomous driving tasks. However, their spatial understanding and reasoning-key capabilities for autonomous driving-still exhibit significant limitations. Notably, none of the existing benchmarks systematically evaluate VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities in driving scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose NuScenes-SpatialQA, the first large-scale ground-truth-based Question-Answer (QA) benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities of VLMs in autonomous driving. Built upon the NuScenes dataset, the benchmark is constructed through an automated 3D scene graph generation pipeline and a QA generation pipeline. The benchmark systematically evaluates VLMs' performance in both spatial understanding and reasoning across multiple dimensions. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse VLMs, including both general and spatial-enhanced models, providing the first comprehensive evaluation of their spatial capabilities in autonomous driving. Surprisingly, the experimental results show that the spatial-enhanced VLM outperforms in qualitative QA but does not demonstrate competitiveness in quantitative QA. In general, VLMs still face considerable challenges in spatial understanding and reasoning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) is a self-supervised learning technique that involves masking portions of an image, such as pixels, patches, or latent representations, and training models to predict the missing information using the visible context. This approach has emerged as a cornerstone in self-supervised learning, unlocking new possibilities in visual understanding by leveraging unannotated data for pre-training. In remote sensing, MIM addresses challenges such as incomplete data caused by cloud cover, occlusions, and sensor limitations, enabling applications like cloud removal, multi-modal data fusion, and super-resolution. By synthesizing and critically analyzing recent advancements, this survey (MIMRS) is a pioneering effort to chart the landscape of mask image modeling in remote sensing. We highlight state-of-the-art methodologies, applications, and future research directions, providing a foundational review to guide innovation in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>ZFusion: An Effective Fuser of Camera and 4D Radar for 3D Object Perception in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable 3D object perception is essential in autonomous driving. Owing to its sensing capabilities in all weather conditions, 4D radar has recently received much attention. However, compared to LiDAR, 4D radar provides much sparser point cloud. In this paper, we propose a 3D object detection method, termed ZFusion, which fuses 4D radar and vision modality. As the core of ZFusion, our proposed FP-DDCA (Feature Pyramid-Double Deformable Cross Attention) fuser complements the (sparse) radar information and (dense) vision information, effectively. Specifically, with a feature-pyramid structure, the FP-DDCA fuser packs Transformer blocks to interactively fuse multi-modal features at different scales, thus enhancing perception accuracy. In addition, we utilize the Depth-Context-Split view transformation module due to the physical properties of 4D radar. Considering that 4D radar has a much lower cost than LiDAR, ZFusion is an attractive alternative to LiDAR-based methods. In typical traffic scenarios like the VoD (View-of-Delft) dataset, experiments show that with reasonable inference speed, ZFusion achieved the state-of-the-art mAP (mean average precision) in the region of interest, while having competitive mAP in the entire area compared to the baseline methods, which demonstrates performance close to LiDAR and greatly outperforms those camera-only methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing MLLM benchmarks face significant challenges in evaluating Unified MLLMs (U-MLLMs) due to: 1) lack of standardized benchmarks for traditional tasks, leading to inconsistent comparisons; 2) absence of benchmarks for mixed-modality generation, which fails to assess multimodal reasoning capabilities. We present a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to systematically assess U-MLLMs. Our benchmark includes: Standardized Traditional Task Evaluation. We sample from 12 datasets, covering 10 tasks with 30 subtasks, ensuring consistent and fair comparisons across studies." 2. Unified Task Assessment. We introduce five novel tasks testing multimodal reasoning, including image editing, commonsense QA with image generation, and geometric reasoning. 3. Comprehensive Model Benchmarking. We evaluate 12 leading U-MLLMs, such as Janus-Pro, EMU3, VILA-U, and Gemini2-flash, alongside specialized understanding (e.g., Claude-3.5-Sonnet) and generation models (e.g., DALL-E-3). Our findings reveal substantial performance gaps in existing U-MLLMs, highlighting the need for more robust models capable of handling mixed-modality tasks effectively.

      <title>Beating Backdoor Attack at Its Own Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15539v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attack, which does not affect the network's performance on clean data but would manipulate the network behavior once a trigger pattern is added. Existing defense methods have greatly reduced attack success rate, but their prediction accuracy on clean data still lags behind a clean model by a large margin. Inspired by the stealthiness and effectiveness of backdoor attack, we propose a simple but highly effective defense framework which injects non-adversarial backdoors targeting poisoned samples. Following the general steps in backdoor attack, we detect a small set of suspected samples and then apply a poisoning strategy to them. The non-adversarial backdoor, once triggered, suppresses the attacker's backdoor on poisoned data, but has limited influence on clean data. The defense can be carried out during data preprocessing, without any modification to the standard end-to-end training pipeline. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks with different architectures and representative attacks. Results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art defense effectiveness with by far the lowest performance drop on clean data. Considering the surprising defense ability displayed by our framework, we call for more attention to utilizing backdoor for backdoor defense. Code is available at https://github.com/minliu01/non-adversarial_backdoor.</description>

      <title>Individualized Deepfake Detection Exploiting Traces Due to Double Neural-Network Operations</title>

Abstract: In today's digital landscape, journalists urgently require tools to verify the authenticity of facial images and videos depicting specific public figures before incorporating them into news stories. Existing deepfake detectors are not optimized for this detection task when an image is associated with a specific and identifiable individual. This study focuses on the deepfake detection of facial images of individual public figures. We propose to condition the proposed detector on the identity of an identified individual, given the advantages revealed by our theory-driven simulations. While most detectors in the literature rely on perceptible or imperceptible artifacts present in deepfake facial images, we demonstrate that the detection performance can be improved by exploiting the idempotency property of neural networks. In our approach, the training process involves double neural-network operations where we pass an authentic image through a deepfake simulating network twice. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the area under the curve (AUC) from 0.92 to 0.94 and reduces its standard deviation by 17%. To address the need for evaluating detection performance for individual public figures, we curated and publicly released a dataset of ~32k images featuring 45 public figures, as existing deepfake datasets do not meet this criterion.</description>

      <title>Towards Adversarially Robust Dataset Distillation by Curvature Regularization</title>

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) allows datasets to be distilled to fractions of their original size while preserving the rich distributional information, so that models trained on the distilled datasets can achieve a comparable accuracy while saving significant computational loads. Recent research in this area has been focusing on improving the accuracy of models trained on distilled datasets. In this paper, we aim to explore a new perspective of DD. We study how to embed adversarial robustness in distilled datasets, so that models trained on these datasets maintain the high accuracy and meanwhile acquire better adversarial robustness. We propose a new method that achieves this goal by incorporating curvature regularization into the distillation process with much less computational overhead than standard adversarial training. Extensive empirical experiments suggest that our method not only outperforms standard adversarial training on both accuracy and robustness with less computation overhead but is also capable of generating robust distilled datasets that can withstand various adversarial attacks.

      <title>A Symmetric Regressor for MRI-Based Assessment of Striatal Dopamine Transporter Uptake in Parkinson's Disease With Enhanced Uncertainty Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging is commonly used for monitoring Parkinson's disease (PD), where striatal DAT uptake amount is computed to assess PD severity. However, DAT imaging has a high cost and the risk of radiance exposure and is not available in general clinics. Recently, MRI patch of the nigral region has been proposed as a safer and easier alternative. This paper proposes a symmetric regressor for predicting the DAT uptake amount from the nigral MRI patch. Acknowledging the symmetry between the right and left nigrae, the proposed regressor incorporates a paired input-output model that simultaneously predicts the DAT uptake amounts for both the right and left striata. Moreover, it employs a symmetric loss that imposes a constraint on the difference between right-to-left predictions, resembling the high correlation in DAT uptake amounts in the two lateral sides. Additionally, we propose a symmetric Monte-Carlo (MC) dropout method for providing a fruitful uncertainty estimate of the DAT uptake prediction, which utilizes the above symmetry. We evaluated the proposed approach on 734 nigral patches, which demonstrated significantly improved performance of the symmetric regressor compared with the standard regressors while giving better explainability and feature representation. The symmetric MC dropout also gave precise uncertainty ranges with a high probability of including the true DAT uptake amounts within the range.</description>

      <title>Towards Domain Adaptive Neural Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09564</link>

Abstract: Contextual bandit algorithms are essential for solving real-world decision making problems. In practice, collecting a contextual bandit's feedback from different domains may involve different costs. For example, measuring drug reaction from mice (as a source domain) and humans (as a target domain). Unfortunately, adapting a contextual bandit algorithm from a source domain to a target domain with distribution shift still remains a major challenge and largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce the first general domain adaptation method for contextual bandits. Our approach learns a bandit model for the target domain by collecting feedback from the source domain. Our theoretical analysis shows that our algorithm maintains a sub-linear regret bound even adapting across domains. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art contextual bandit algorithms on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Reliable-loc: Robust sequential LiDAR global localization in large-scale street scenes based on verifiable cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wearable laser scanning (WLS) system has the advantages of flexibility and portability. It can be used for determining the user's path within a prior map, which is a huge demand for applications in pedestrian navigation, collaborative mapping, augmented reality, and emergency rescue. However, existing LiDAR-based global localization methods suffer from insufficient robustness, especially in complex large-scale outdoor scenes with insufficient features and incomplete coverage of the prior map. To address such challenges, we propose LiDAR-based reliable global localization (Reliable-loc) exploiting the verifiable cues in the sequential LiDAR data. First, we propose a Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) based on spatially verifiable cues, utilizing the rich information embedded in local features to adjust the particles' weights hence avoiding the particles converging to erroneous regions. Second, we propose a localization status monitoring mechanism guided by the sequential pose uncertainties and adaptively switching the localization mode using the temporal verifiable cues to avoid the crash of the localization system. To validate the proposed Reliable-loc, comprehensive experiments have been conducted on a large-scale heterogeneous point cloud dataset consisting of high-precision vehicle-mounted mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds and helmet-mounted WLS point clouds, which cover various street scenes with a length of over 30 km. The experimental results indicate that Reliable-loc exhibits high robustness, accuracy, and efficiency in large-scale, complex street scenes, with a position accuracy of 2.91 m, yaw accuracy of 3.74 degrees, and achieves real-time performance. For the code and detailed experimental results, please refer to https://github.com/zouxianghong/Reliable-loc.</description>

      <title>A multidimensional measurement of photorealistic avatar quality of experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photorealistic avatars are human avatars that look, move, and talk like real people. The performance of photorealistic avatars has significantly improved recently based on objective metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, FID, and FVD. However, recent photorealistic avatar publications do not provide subjective tests of the avatars to measure human usability factors. We provide an open source test framework to subjectively measure photorealistic avatar performance in ten dimensions: realism, trust, comfortableness using, comfortableness interacting with, appropriateness for work, creepiness, formality, affinity, resemblance to the person, and emotion accuracy. Using telecommunication scenarios, we show that the correlation of nine of these subjective metrics with PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, FID, and FVD is weak, and moderate for emotion accuracy. The crowdsourced subjective test framework is highly reproducible and accurate when compared to a panel of experts. We analyze a wide range of avatars from photorealistic to cartoon-like and show that some photorealistic avatars are approaching real video performance based on these dimensions. We also find that for avatars above a certain level of realism, eight of these measured dimensions are strongly correlated. This means that avatars that are not as realistic as real video will have lower trust, comfortableness using, comfortableness interacting with, appropriateness for work, formality, and affinity, and higher creepiness compared to real video. In addition, because there is a strong linear relationship between avatar affinity and realism, there is no uncanny valley effect for photorealistic avatars in the telecommunication scenario. We suggest several extensions of this test framework for future work and discuss design implications for telecommunication systems. The test framework is available at https://github.com/microsoft/P.910.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Reasoning Ability of Multimodal Large Language Models via Mixed Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generally follow a training process involving pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. However, these models suffer from distribution shifts, which limit their multimodal reasoning, particularly in the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) performance. To address this, we introduce a preference optimization (PO) process to enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Specifically, (1) on the data side, we design an automated preference data construction pipeline to create MMPR, a high-quality, large-scale multimodal reasoning preference dataset; and (2) on the model side, we explore integrating PO with MLLMs, developing a simple yet effective method, termed Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO), which boosts multimodal CoT performance. Our approach enhances the multimodal reasoning abilities of both InternVL2-8B and InternVL2-76B. Notably, our model, InternVL2-8B-MPO, achieves an accuracy of 67.0 on MathVista, outperforming InternVL2-8B by 8.7 points and achieving performance comparable to the 10$\times$ larger InternVL2-76B. We hope this study could inspire further advancements in MLLMs. Code, data, and model are released.</description>

      <title>INRetouch: Context Aware Implicit Neural Representation for Photography Retouching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Professional photo editing remains challenging, requiring extensive knowledge of imaging pipelines and significant expertise. While recent deep learning approaches, particularly style transfer methods, have attempted to automate this process, they often struggle with output fidelity, editing control, and complex retouching capabilities. We propose a novel retouch transfer approach that learns from professional edits through before-after image pairs, enabling precise replication of complex editing operations. We develop a context-aware Implicit Neural Representation that learns to apply edits adaptively based on image content and context, and is capable of learning from a single example. Our method extracts implicit transformations from reference edits and adaptively applies them to new images. To facilitate this research direction, we introduce a comprehensive Photo Retouching Dataset comprising 100,000 high-quality images edited using over 170 professional Adobe Lightroom presets. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach not only surpasses existing methods in photo retouching but also enhances performance in related image reconstruction tasks like Gamut Mapping and Raw Reconstruction. By bridging the gap between professional editing capabilities and automated solutions, our work presents a significant step toward making sophisticated photo editing more accessible while maintaining high-fidelity results.

      <title>Efficient Diversity-Preserving Diffusion Alignment via Gradient-Informed GFlowNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While one commonly trains large diffusion models by collecting datasets on target downstream tasks, it is often desired to align and finetune pretrained diffusion models with some reward functions that are either designed by experts or learned from small-scale datasets. Existing post-training methods for reward finetuning of diffusion models typically suffer from lack of diversity in generated samples, lack of prior preservation, and/or slow convergence in finetuning. Inspired by recent successes in generative flow networks (GFlowNets), a class of probabilistic models that sample with the unnormalized density of a reward function, we propose a novel GFlowNet method dubbed Nabla-GFlowNet (abbreviated as $\nabla$-GFlowNet), the first GFlowNet method that leverages the rich signal in reward gradients, together with an objective called $\nabla$-DB plus its variant residual $\nabla$-DB designed for prior-preserving diffusion finetuning. We show that our proposed method achieves fast yet diversity- and prior-preserving finetuning of Stable Diffusion, a large-scale text-conditioned image diffusion model, on different realistic reward functions.</description>

      <title>TrajLearn: Trajectory Prediction Learning using Deep Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction aims to estimate an entity's future path using its current position and historical movement data, benefiting fields like autonomous navigation, robotics, and human movement analytics. Deep learning approaches have become key in this area, utilizing large-scale trajectory datasets to model movement patterns, but face challenges in managing complex spatial dependencies and adapting to dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce TrajLearn, a novel model for trajectory prediction that leverages generative modeling of higher-order mobility flows based on hexagonal spatial representation. TrajLearn predicts the next $k$ steps by integrating a customized beam search for exploring multiple potential paths while maintaining spatial continuity. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of TrajLearn, benchmarking it against leading state-of-the-art approaches and meaningful baselines. The results indicate that TrajLearn achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of up to ~40% across multiple real-world trajectory datasets. In addition, we evaluated different prediction horizons (i.e., various values of $k$), conducted resolution sensitivity analysis, and performed ablation studies to assess the impact of key model components. Furthermore, we developed a novel algorithm to generate mixed-resolution maps by hierarchically subdividing hexagonal regions into finer segments within a specified observation area. This approach supports selective detailing, applying finer resolution to areas of interest or high activity (e.g., urban centers) while using coarser resolution for less significant regions (e.g., rural areas), effectively reducing data storage requirements and computational overhead. We promote reproducibility and adaptability by offering complete code, data, and detailed documentation with flexible configuration options for various applications.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Video Analytics in Cloud-Edge-Terminal Collaborative Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06581v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The explosive growth of video data has driven the development of distributed video analytics in cloud-edge-terminal collaborative (CETC) systems, enabling efficient video processing, real-time inference, and privacy-preserving analysis. Among multiple advantages, CETC systems can distribute video processing tasks and enable adaptive analytics across cloud, edge, and terminal devices, leading to breakthroughs in video surveillance, autonomous driving, and smart cities. In this survey, we first analyze fundamental architectural components, including hierarchical, distributed, and hybrid frameworks, alongside edge computing platforms and resource management mechanisms. Building upon these foundations, edge-centric approaches emphasize on-device processing, edge-assisted offloading, and edge intelligence, while cloud-centric methods leverage powerful computational capabilities for complex video understanding and model training. Our investigation also covers hybrid video analytics incorporating adaptive task offloading and resource-aware scheduling techniques that optimize performance across the entire system. Beyond conventional approaches, recent advances in large language models and multimodal integration reveal both opportunities and challenges in platform scalability, data protection, and system reliability. Future directions also encompass explainable systems, efficient processing mechanisms, and advanced video analytics, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in this dynamic field.</description>

      <title>FetalCLIP: A Visual-Language Foundation Model for Fetal Ultrasound Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models are becoming increasingly effective in the medical domain, offering pre-trained models on large datasets that can be readily adapted for downstream tasks. Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.</description>

      <title>Joint multiband deconvolution for Euclid and Vera C. Rubin images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of surveys like Euclid and Vera C. Rubin, astrophysicists will have access to both deep, high-resolution images and multiband images. However, these two types are not simultaneously available in any single dataset. It is therefore vital to devise image deconvolution algorithms that exploit the best of both worlds and that can jointly analyze datasets spanning a range of resolutions and wavelengths. In this work we introduce a novel multiband deconvolution technique aimed at improving the resolution of ground-based astronomical images by leveraging higher-resolution space-based observations. The method capitalizes on the fortunate fact that the Rubin $r$, $i$, and $z$ bands lie within the Euclid VIS band. The algorithm jointly de-convolves all the data to convert the $r$-, $i$-, and $z$-band Rubin images to the resolution of Euclid by leveraging the correlations between the different bands. We also investigate the performance of deep-learning-based denoising with DRUNet to further improve the results. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of resolution and morphology recovery, flux preservation, and generalization to different noise levels. This approach extends beyond the specific Euclid-Rubin combination, offering a versatile solution to improving the resolution of ground-based images in multiple photometric bands by jointly using any space-based images with overlapping filters.</description>

      <title>SPIDER: A Comprehensive Multi-Organ Supervised Pathology Dataset and Baseline Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancing AI in computational pathology requires large, high-quality, and diverse datasets, yet existing public datasets are often limited in organ diversity, class coverage, or annotation quality. To bridge this gap, we introduce SPIDER (Supervised Pathology Image-DEscription Repository), the largest publicly available patch-level dataset covering multiple organ types, including Skin, Colorectal, Thorax, and Breast with comprehensive class coverage for each organ. SPIDER provides high-quality annotations verified by expert pathologists and includes surrounding context patches, which enhance classification performance by providing spatial context.
  Alongside the dataset, we present baseline models trained on SPIDER using the Hibou-L foundation model as a feature extractor combined with an attention-based classification head. The models achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple tissue categories and serve as strong benchmarks for future digital pathology research. Beyond patch classification, the model enables rapid identification of significant areas, quantitative tissue metrics, and establishes a foundation for multimodal approaches.
  Both the dataset and trained models are publicly available to advance research, reproducibility, and AI-driven pathology development. Access them at: https://github.com/HistAI/SPIDER</description>

      <title>CODEI: Resource-Efficient Task-Driven Co-Design of Perception and Decision Making for Mobile Robots Applied to Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the integration challenges and strategies for designing mobile robots, by focusing on the task-driven, optimal selection of hardware and software to balance safety, efficiency, and minimal usage of resources such as costs, energy, computational requirements, and weight. We emphasize the interplay between perception and motion planning in decision-making by introducing the concept of occupancy queries to quantify the perception requirements for sampling-based motion planners. Sensor and algorithm performance are evaluated using False Negative Rates (FPR) and False Positive Rates (FPR) across various factors such as geometric relationships, object properties, sensor resolution, and environmental conditions. By integrating perception requirements with perception performance, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach is proposed for efficient sensor and algorithm selection and placement. This forms the basis for a co-design optimization that includes the robot body, motion planner, perception pipeline, and computing unit. We refer to this framework for solving the co-design problem of mobile robots as CODEI, short for Co-design of Embodied Intelligence. A case study on developing an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) for urban scenarios provides actionable information for designers, and shows that complex tasks escalate resource demands, with task performance affecting choices of the autonomy stack. The study demonstrates that resource prioritization influences sensor choice: cameras are preferred for cost-effective and lightweight designs, while lidar sensors are chosen for better energy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Science-Inspired Evaluation of Core Capabilities for Object Understanding in AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the core components of our world models is 'intuitive physics' - an understanding of objects, space, and causality. This capability enables us to predict events, plan action and navigate environments, all of which rely on a composite sense of objecthood. Despite its importance, there is no single, unified account of objecthood, though multiple theoretical frameworks provide insights. In the first part of this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the main theoretical frameworks in objecthood research - Gestalt psychology, enactive cognition, and developmental psychology - and identify the core capabilities each framework attributes to object understanding, as well as what functional roles they play in shaping world models in biological agents. Given the foundational role of objecthood in world modelling, understanding objecthood is also essential in AI. In the second part of the paper, we evaluate how current AI paradigms approach and test objecthood capabilities compared to those in cognitive science. We define an AI paradigm as a combination of how objecthood is conceptualised, the methods used for studying objecthood, the data utilised, and the evaluation techniques. We find that, whilst benchmarks can detect that AI systems model isolated aspects of objecthood, the benchmarks cannot detect when AI systems lack functional integration across these capabilities, not solving the objecthood challenge fully. Finally, we explore novel evaluation approaches that align with the integrated vision of objecthood outlined in this paper. These methods are promising candidates for advancing from isolated object capabilities toward general-purpose AI with genuine object understanding in real-world contexts.</description>
