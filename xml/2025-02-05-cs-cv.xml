      <title>A two-stage dual-task learning strategy for early prediction of pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rationale and Objectives: Early prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) can facilitate personalized treatment for breast cancer patients. To improve prediction accuracy at the early time point of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we proposed a two-stage dual-task learning strategy to train a deep neural network for early prediction of pCR using early-treatment magnetic resonance images. Methods: We developed and validated the two-stage dual-task learning strategy using the dataset from the national-wide, multi-institutional I-SPY2 clinical trial, which included dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images acquired at three time points: pretreatment (T0), after 3 weeks (T1), and after 12 weeks of treatment (T2). First, we trained a convolutional long short-term memory network to predict pCR and extract the latent space image features at T2. At the second stage, we trained a dual-task network to simultaneously predict pCR and the image features at T2 using images from T0 and T1. This allowed us to predict pCR earlier without using images from T2. Results: The conventional single-stage single-task strategy gave an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.799 for pCR prediction using all the data at time points T0 and T1. By using the proposed two-stage dual-task learning strategy, the AUROC was improved to 0.820. Conclusions: The proposed two-stage dual-task learning strategy can improve model performance significantly (p=0.0025) for predicting pCR at the early stage (3rd week) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The early prediction model can potentially help physicians to intervene early and develop personalized plans at the early stage of chemotherapy.</description>

      <title>SpikingRTNH: Spiking Neural Network for 4D Radar Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, 4D Radar has emerged as a crucial sensor for 3D object detection in autonomous vehicles, offering both stable perception in adverse weather and high-density point clouds for object shape recognition. However, processing such high-density data demands substantial computational resources and energy consumption. We propose SpikingRTNH, the first spiking neural network (SNN) for 3D object detection using 4D Radar data. By replacing conventional ReLU activation functions with leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) spiking neurons, SpikingRTNH achieves significant energy efficiency gains. Furthermore, inspired by human cognitive processes, we introduce biological top-down inference (BTI), which processes point clouds sequentially from higher to lower densities. This approach effectively utilizes points with lower noise and higher importance for detection. Experiments on K-Radar dataset demonstrate that SpikingRTNH with BTI significantly reduces energy consumption by 78% while achieving comparable detection performance to its ANN counterpart (51.1% AP 3D, 57.0% AP BEV). These results establish the viability of SNNs for energy-efficient 4D Radar-based object detection in autonomous driving systems.

      <title>Influence of color correction on pathology detection in Capsule Endoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pathology detection in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) using deep learning has been explored in the recent past. However, deep learning models can be influenced by the color quality of the dataset used to train them, impacting detection, segmentation and classification tasks. In this work, we evaluate the impact of color correction on pathology detection using two prominent object detection models: Retinanet and YOLOv5. We first generate two color corrected versions of a popular WCE dataset (i.e., SEE-AI dataset) using two different color correction functions. We then evaluate the performance of the Retinanet and YOLOv5 on the original and color corrected versions of the dataset. The results reveal that color correction makes the models generate larger bounding boxes and larger intersection areas with the ground truth annotations. Furthermore, color correction leads to an increased number of false positives for certain pathologies. However, these effects do not translate into a consistent improvement in performance metrics such as F1-scores, IoU, and AP50. The code is available at https://github.com/agossouema2011/WCE2024.

      <title>CerraData-4MM: A multimodal benchmark dataset on Cerrado for land use and land cover classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cerrado faces increasing environmental pressures, necessitating accurate land use and land cover (LULC) mapping despite challenges such as class imbalance and visually similar categories. To address this, we present CerraData-4MM, a multimodal dataset combining Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imagery (MSI) with 10m spatial resolution. The dataset includes two hierarchical classification levels with 7 and 14 classes, respectively, focusing on the diverse Bico do Papagaio ecoregion. We highlight CerraData-4MM's capacity to benchmark advanced semantic segmentation techniques by evaluating a standard U-Net and a more sophisticated Vision Transformer (ViT) model. The ViT achieves superior performance in multimodal scenarios, with the highest macro F1-score of 57.60% and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 49.05% at the first hierarchical level. Both models struggle with minority classes, particularly at the second hierarchical level, where U-Net's performance drops to an F1-score of 18.16%. Class balancing improves representation for underrepresented classes but reduces overall accuracy, underscoring the trade-off in weighted training. CerraData-4MM offers a challenging benchmark for advancing deep learning models to handle class imbalance and multimodal data fusion. Code, trained models, and data are publicly available at https://github.com/ai4luc/CerraData-4MM.</description>

      <title>AIN: The Arabic INclusive Large Multimodal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amid the swift progress of large language models (LLMs) and their evolution into large multimodal models (LMMs), significant strides have been made in high-resource languages such as English and Chinese. While Arabic LLMs have seen notable progress, Arabic LMMs remain largely unexplored, often narrowly focusing on a few specific aspects of the language and visual understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIN-the Arabic Inclusive Multimodal Model-designed to excel across diverse domains. AIN is an English-Arabic bilingual LMM designed to excel in English and Arabic, leveraging carefully constructed 3.6 million high-quality Arabic-English multimodal data samples. AIN demonstrates state-of-the-art Arabic performance, while also possessing strong English-language visual capabilities. On the recent CAMEL-Bench benchmark comprising 38 sub-domains including, multi-image understanding, complex visual perception, handwritten document understanding, video understanding, medical imaging, plant diseases, and remote sensing-based land use understanding, our AIN demonstrates strong performance with the 7B model outperforming GPT-4o by an absolute gain of 3.4% averaged over eight domains and 38 sub-domains. AIN's superior capabilities position it as a significant step toward empowering Arabic speakers with advanced multimodal generative AI tools across diverse applications.</description>

      <title>ProtoSnap: Prototype Alignment for Cuneiform Signs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cuneiform writing system served as the medium for transmitting knowledge in the ancient Near East for a period of over three thousand years. Cuneiform signs have a complex internal structure which is the subject of expert paleographic analysis, as variations in sign shapes bear witness to historical developments and transmission of writing and culture over time. However, prior automated techniques mostly treat sign types as categorical and do not explicitly model their highly varied internal configurations. In this work, we present an unsupervised approach for recovering the fine-grained internal configuration of cuneiform signs by leveraging powerful generative models and the appearance and structure of prototype font images as priors. Our approach, ProtoSnap, enforces structural consistency on matches found with deep image features to estimate the diverse configurations of cuneiform characters, snapping a skeleton-based template to photographed cuneiform signs. We provide a new benchmark of expert annotations and evaluate our method on this task. Our evaluation shows that our approach succeeds in aligning prototype skeletons to a wide variety of cuneiform signs. Moreover, we show that conditioning on structures produced by our method allows for generating synthetic data with correct structural configurations, significantly boosting the performance of cuneiform sign recognition beyond existing techniques, in particular over rare signs. Our code, data, and trained models are available at the project page: https://tau-vailab.github.io/ProtoSnap/</description>

      <title>Exploring Transfer Learning for Deep Learning Polyp Detection in Colonoscopy Images Using YOLOv8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning methods have demonstrated strong performance in objection tasks; however, their ability to learn domain-specific applications with limited training data remains a significant challenge. Transfer learning techniques address this issue by leveraging knowledge from pre-training on related datasets, enabling faster and more efficient learning for new tasks. Finding the right dataset for pre-training can play a critical role in determining the success of transfer learning and overall model performance. In this paper, we investigate the impact of pre-training a YOLOv8n model on seven distinct datasets, evaluating their effectiveness when transferred to the task of polyp detection. We compare whether large, general-purpose datasets with diverse objects outperform niche datasets with characteristics similar to polyps. In addition, we assess the influence of the size of the dataset on the efficacy of transfer learning. Experiments on the polyp datasets show that models pre-trained on relevant datasets consistently outperform those trained from scratch, highlighting the benefit of pre-training on datasets with shared domain-specific features.</description>

      <title>ALBAR: Adversarial Learning approach to mitigate Biases in Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bias in machine learning models can lead to unfair decision making, and while it has been well-studied in the image and text domains, it remains underexplored in action recognition. Action recognition models often suffer from background bias (i.e., inferring actions based on background cues) and foreground bias (i.e., relying on subject appearance), which can be detrimental to real-life applications such as autonomous vehicles or assisted living monitoring. While prior approaches have mainly focused on mitigating background bias using specialized augmentations, we thoroughly study both biases. We propose ALBAR, a novel adversarial training method that mitigates foreground and background biases without requiring specialized knowledge of the bias attributes. Our framework applies an adversarial cross-entropy loss to the sampled static clip (where all the frames are the same) and aims to make its class probabilities uniform using a proposed entropy maximization loss. Additionally, we introduce a gradient penalty loss for regularization against the debiasing process. We evaluate our method on established background and foreground bias protocols, setting a new state-of-the-art and strongly improving combined debiasing performance by over 12% on HMDB51. Furthermore, we identify an issue of background leakage in the existing UCF101 protocol for bias evaluation which provides a shortcut to predict actions and does not provide an accurate measure of the debiasing capability of a model. We address this issue by proposing more fine-grained segmentation boundaries for the actor, where our method also outperforms existing approaches.

      <title>Lifting by Gaussians: A Simple, Fast and Flexible Method for 3D Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Lifting By Gaussians (LBG), a novel approach for open-world instance segmentation of 3D Gaussian Splatted Radiance Fields (3DGS). Recently, 3DGS Fields have emerged as a highly efficient and explicit alternative to Neural Field-based methods for high-quality Novel View Synthesis. Our 3D instance segmentation method directly lifts 2D segmentation masks from SAM (alternately FastSAM, etc.), together with features from CLIP and DINOv2, directly fusing them onto 3DGS (or similar Gaussian radiance fields such as 2DGS). Unlike previous approaches, LBG requires no per-scene training, allowing it to operate seamlessly on any existing 3DGS reconstruction. Our approach is not only an order of magnitude faster and simpler than existing approaches; it is also highly modular, enabling 3D semantic segmentation of existing 3DGS fields without requiring a specific parametrization of the 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, our technique achieves superior semantic segmentation for 2D semantic novel view synthesis and 3D asset extraction results while maintaining flexibility and efficiency. We further introduce a novel approach to evaluate individually segmented 3D assets from 3D radiance field segmentation methods.</description>

      <title>DermaSynth: Rich Synthetic Image-Text Pairs Using Open Access Dermatology Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major barrier to developing vision large language models (LLMs) in dermatology is the lack of large image--text pairs dataset. We introduce DermaSynth, a dataset comprising of 92,020 synthetic image--text pairs curated from 45,205 images (13,568 clinical and 35,561 dermatoscopic) for dermatology-related clinical tasks. Leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs, using Gemini 2.0, we used clinically related prompts and self-instruct method to generate diverse and rich synthetic texts. Metadata of the datasets were incorporated into the input prompts by targeting to reduce potential hallucinations. The resulting dataset builds upon open access dermatological image repositories (DERM12345, BCN20000, PAD-UFES-20, SCIN, and HIBA) that have permissive CC-BY-4.0 licenses. We also fine-tuned a preliminary Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct model, DermatoLlama 1.0, on 5,000 samples. We anticipate this dataset to support and accelerate AI research in dermatology. Data and code underlying this work are accessible at https://github.com/abdurrahimyilmaz/DermaSynth.</description>

      <title>EcoWeedNet: A Lightweight and Automated Weed Detection Method for Sustainable Next-Generation Agricultural Consumer Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sustainable agriculture plays a crucial role in ensuring world food security for consumers. A critical challenge faced by sustainable precision agriculture is weed growth, as weeds share essential resources with the crops, such as water, soil nutrients, and sunlight, which notably affect crop yields. The traditional methods employed to combat weeds include the usage of chemical herbicides and manual weed removal methods. However, these could damage the environment and pose health hazards. The adoption of automated computer vision technologies and ground agricultural consumer electronic vehicles in precision agriculture offers sustainable, low-carbon solutions. However, prior works suffer from issues such as low accuracy and precision and high computational expense. This work proposes EcoWeedNet, a novel model with enhanced weed detection performance without adding significant computational complexity, aligning with the goals of low-carbon agricultural practices. Additionally, our model is lightweight and optimal for deployment on ground-based consumer electronic agricultural vehicles and robots. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on the CottonWeedDet12 benchmark dataset reflecting real-world scenarios. EcoWeedNet achieves performance close to that of large models yet with much fewer parameters. (approximately 4.21% of the parameters and 6.59% of the GFLOPs of YOLOv4). This work contributes effectively to the development of automated weed detection methods for next-generation agricultural consumer electronics featuring lower energy consumption and lower carbon footprint. This work paves the way forward for sustainable agricultural consumer technologies.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Random Forest and CNN Framework for Tile-Wise Oil-Water Classification in Hyperspectral Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel hybrid Random Forest and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework is presented for oil-water classification in hyperspectral images (HSI). To address the challenge of preserving spatial context, the images were divided into smaller, non-overlapping tiles, which served as the basis for training, validation, and testing. Random Forest demonstrated strong performance in pixel-wise classification, outperforming models such as XGBoost, Attention-Based U-Net, and HybridSN. However, Random Forest loses spatial context, limiting its ability to fully exploit the spatial relationships in hyperspectral data. To improve performance, a CNN was trained on the probability maps generated by the Random Forest, leveraging the CNN's capacity to incorporate spatial context. The hybrid approach achieved 7.6% improvement in recall (to 0.85), 2.4% improvement in F1 score (to 0.84), and 0.54% improvement in AUC (to 0.99) compared to the baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining probabilistic outputs with spatial feature learning for context-aware analysis of hyperspectral images.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Vector Font Classification Using Different Font Formats: TrueType versus PostScript</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern fonts adopt vector-based formats, which ensure scalability without loss of quality. While many deep learning studies on fonts focus on bitmap formats, deep learning for vector fonts remains underexplored. In studies involving deep learning for vector fonts, the choice of font representation has often been made conventionally. However, the font representation format is one of the factors that can influence the computational performance of machine learning models in font-related tasks. Here we show that font representations based on PostScript outlines outperform those based on TrueType outlines in Transformer-based vector font classification. TrueType outlines represent character shapes as sequences of points and their associated flags, whereas PostScript outlines represent them as sequences of commands. In previous research, PostScript outlines have been predominantly used when fonts are treated as part of vector graphics, while TrueType outlines are mainly employed when focusing on fonts alone. Whether to use PostScript or TrueType outlines has been mainly determined by file format specifications and precedent settings in previous studies, rather than performance considerations. To date, few studies have compared which outline format provides better embedding representations. Our findings suggest that information aggregation is crucial in Transformer-based deep learning for vector graphics, as in tokenization in language models and patch division in bitmap-based image recognition models. This insight provides valuable guidance for selecting outline formats in future research on vector graphics.</description>

      <title>INSIGHT: Enhancing Autonomous Driving Safety through Vision-Language Models on Context-Aware Hazard Detection and Edge Case Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00262v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in handling unpredictable edge-case scenarios, such as adversarial pedestrian movements, dangerous vehicle maneuvers, and sudden environmental changes. Current end-to-end driving models struggle with generalization to these rare events due to limitations in traditional detection and prediction approaches. To address this, we propose INSIGHT (Integration of Semantic and Visual Inputs for Generalized Hazard Tracking), a hierarchical vision-language model (VLM) framework designed to enhance hazard detection and edge-case evaluation. By using multimodal data fusion, our approach integrates semantic and visual representations, enabling precise interpretation of driving scenarios and accurate forecasting of potential dangers. Through supervised fine-tuning of VLMs, we optimize spatial hazard localization using attention-based mechanisms and coordinate regression techniques. Experimental results on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate a substantial improvement in hazard prediction straightforwardness and accuracy over existing models, achieving a notable increase in generalization performance. This advancement enhances the robustness and safety of autonomous driving systems, ensuring improved situational awareness and potential decision-making in complex real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>MCM: Multi-layer Concept Map for Efficient Concept Learning from Masked Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masking strategies commonly employed in natural language processing are still underexplored in vision tasks such as concept learning, where conventional methods typically rely on full images. However, using masked images diversifies perceptual inputs, potentially offering significant advantages in concept learning with large-scale Transformer models. To this end, we propose Multi-layer Concept Map (MCM), the first work to devise an efficient concept learning method based on masked images. In particular, we introduce an asymmetric concept learning architecture by establishing correlations between different encoder and decoder layers, updating concept tokens using backward gradients from reconstruction tasks. The learned concept tokens at various levels of granularity help either reconstruct the masked image patches by filling in gaps or guide the reconstruction results in a direction that reflects specific concepts. Moreover, we present both quantitative and qualitative results across a wide range of metrics, demonstrating that MCM significantly reduces computational costs by training on fewer than 75% of the total image patches while enhancing concept prediction performance. Additionally, editing specific concept tokens in the latent space enables targeted image generation from masked images, aligning both the visible contextual patches and the provided concepts. By further adjusting the testing time mask ratio, we could produce a range of reconstructions that blend the visible patches with the provided concepts, proportional to the chosen ratios.</description>

      <title>A Diffusion Model Translator for Efficient Image-to-Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying diffusion models to image-to-image translation (I2I) has recently received increasing attention due to its practical applications. Previous attempts inject information from the source image into each denoising step for an iterative refinement, thus resulting in a time-consuming implementation. We propose an efficient method that equips a diffusion model with a lightweight translator, dubbed a Diffusion Model Translator (DMT), to accomplish I2I. Specifically, we first offer theoretical justification that in employing the pioneering DDPM work for the I2I task, it is both feasible and sufficient to transfer the distribution from one domain to another only at some intermediate step. We further observe that the translation performance highly depends on the chosen timestep for domain transfer, and therefore propose a practical strategy to automatically select an appropriate timestep for a given task. We evaluate our approach on a range of I2I applications, including image stylization, image colorization, segmentation to image, and sketch to image, to validate its efficacy and general utility. The comparisons show that our DMT surpasses existing methods in both quality and efficiency. Code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>MonoDINO-DETR: Depth-Enhanced Monocular 3D Object Detection Using a Vision Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes novel methods to enhance the performance of monocular 3D object detection models by leveraging the generalized feature extraction capabilities of a vision foundation model. Unlike traditional CNN-based approaches, which often suffer from inaccurate depth estimation and rely on multi-stage object detection pipelines, this study employs a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based foundation model as the backbone, which excels at capturing global features for depth estimation. It integrates a detection transformer (DETR) architecture to improve both depth estimation and object detection performance in a one-stage manner. Specifically, a hierarchical feature fusion block is introduced to extract richer visual features from the foundation model, further enhancing feature extraction capabilities. Depth estimation accuracy is further improved by incorporating a relative depth estimation model trained on large-scale data and fine-tuning it through transfer learning. Additionally, the use of queries in the transformer's decoder, which consider reference points and the dimensions of 2D bounding boxes, enhances recognition performance. The proposed model outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the KITTI 3D benchmark and a custom dataset collected from high-elevation racing environments.

      <title>BiMaCoSR: Binary One-Step Diffusion Model Leveraging Flexible Matrix Compression for Real Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00333v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While super-resolution (SR) methods based on diffusion models (DM) have demonstrated inspiring performance, their deployment is impeded due to the heavy request of memory and computation. Recent researchers apply two kinds of methods to compress or fasten the DM. One is to compress the DM into 1-bit, aka binarization, alleviating the storage and computation pressure. The other distills the multi-step DM into only one step, significantly speeding up inference process. Nonetheless, it remains impossible to deploy DM to resource-limited edge devices. To address this problem, we propose BiMaCoSR, which combines binarization and one-step distillation to obtain extreme compression and acceleration. To prevent the catastrophic collapse of the model caused by binarization, we proposed sparse matrix branch (SMB) and low rank matrix branch (LRMB). Both auxiliary branches pass the full-precision (FP) information but in different ways. SMB absorbs the extreme values and its output is high rank, carrying abundant FP information. Whereas, the design of LRMB is inspired by LoRA and is initialized with the top r SVD components, outputting low rank representation. The computation and storage overhead of our proposed branches can be safely ignored. Comprehensive comparison experiments are conducted to exhibit BiMaCoSR outperforms current state-of-the-art binarization methods and gains competitive performance compared with FP one-step model. BiMaCoSR achieves a 23.8x compression ratio and a 27.4x speedup ratio compared to FP counterpart. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/BiMaCoSR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Scene Question Answering (3D SQA) represents an interdisciplinary task that integrates 3D visual perception and natural language processing, empowering intelligent agents to comprehend and interact with complex 3D environments. Recent advances in large multimodal modelling have driven the creation of diverse datasets and spurred the development of instruction-tuning and zero-shot methods for 3D SQA. However, this rapid progress introduces challenges, particularly in achieving unified analysis and comparison across datasets and baselines. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of 3D SQA, systematically reviewing datasets, methodologies, and evaluation metrics while highlighting critical challenges and future opportunities in dataset standardization, multimodal fusion, and task design.</description>

      <title>Shape from Semantics: 3D Shape Generation from Multi-View Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose ``Shape from Semantics'', which is able to create 3D models whose geometry and appearance match given semantics when observed from different views. Traditional ``Shape from X'' tasks usually use visual input (e.g., RGB images or depth maps) to reconstruct geometry, imposing strict constraints that limit creative explorations. As applications, works like Shadow Art and Wire Art often struggle to grasp the embedded semantics of their design through direct observation and rely heavily on specific setups for proper display. To address these limitations, our framework uses semantics as input, greatly expanding the design space to create objects that integrate multiple semantic elements and are easily discernible by observers. Considering that this task requires a rich imagination, we adopt various generative models and structure-to-detail pipelines. Specifically, we adopt multi-semantics Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to distill 3D geometry and appearance from 2D diffusion models, ensuring that the initial shape is consistent with the semantic input. We then use image restoration and video generation models to add more details as supervision. Finally, we introduce neural signed distance field (SDF) representation to achieve detailed shape reconstruction. Our framework generates meshes with complex details, well-structured geometry, coherent textures, and smooth transitions, resulting in visually appealing and eye-catching designs.

      <title>NAVER: A Neuro-Symbolic Compositional Automaton for Visual Grounding with Explicit Logic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) tasks, such as referring expression detection and segmentation tasks are important for linking visual entities to context, especially in complex reasoning tasks that require detailed query interpretation. This paper explores VG beyond basic perception, highlighting challenges for methods that require reasoning like human cognition. Recent advances in large language methods (LLMs) and Vision-Language methods (VLMs) have improved abilities for visual comprehension, contextual understanding, and reasoning. These methods are mainly split into end-to-end and compositional methods, with the latter offering more flexibility. Compositional approaches that integrate LLMs and foundation models show promising performance but still struggle with complex reasoning with language-based logical representations. To address these limitations, we propose NAVER, a compositional visual grounding method that integrates explicit probabilistic logic reasoning within a finite-state automaton, equipped with a self-correcting mechanism. This design improves robustness and interpretability in inference through explicit logic reasoning. Our results show that NAVER achieves SoTA performance comparing to recent end-to-end and compositional baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/ControlNet/NAVER .</description>

      <title>Scalable Framework for Classifying AI-Generated Content Across Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of generative AI technologies has heightened the importance of effectively distinguishing between human and AI-generated content, as well as classifying outputs from diverse generative models. This paper presents a scalable framework that integrates perceptual hashing, similarity measurement, and pseudo-labeling to address these challenges. Our method enables the incorporation of new generative models without retraining, ensuring adaptability and robustness in dynamic scenarios. Comprehensive evaluations on the Defactify4 dataset demonstrate competitive performance in text and image classification tasks, achieving high accuracy across both distinguishing human and AI-generated content and classifying among generative methods. These results highlight the framework's potential for real-world applications as generative AI continues to evolve.

      <title>Latent Action Learning Requires Supervision in the Presence of Distractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, latent action learning, pioneered by Latent Action Policies (LAPO), have shown remarkable pre-training efficiency on observation-only data, offering potential for leveraging vast amounts of video available on the web for embodied AI. However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</description>

      <title>Masked Generative Nested Transformers with Decode Time Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in visual generation have made significant strides in producing content of exceptional quality. However, most methods suffer from a fundamental problem - a bottleneck of inference computational efficiency. Most of these algorithms involve multiple passes over a transformer model to generate tokens or denoise inputs. However, the model size is kept consistent throughout all iterations, which makes it computationally expensive. In this work, we aim to address this issue primarily through two key ideas - (a) not all parts of the generation process need equal compute, and we design a decode time model scaling schedule to utilize compute effectively, and (b) we can cache and reuse some of the computation. Combining these two ideas leads to using smaller models to process more tokens while large models process fewer tokens. These different-sized models do not increase the parameter size, as they share parameters. We rigorously experiment with ImageNet256$\times$256 , UCF101, and Kinetics600 to showcase the efficacy of the proposed method for image/video generation and frame prediction. Our experiments show that with almost $3\times$ less compute than baseline, our model obtains competitive performance.</description>

      <title>Efficient Adaptive Label Refinement for Label Noise Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to overfitting noisy labels, which leads to degraded performance. Existing methods address this issue by employing manually defined criteria, aiming to achieve optimal partitioning in each iteration to avoid fitting noisy labels while thoroughly learning clean samples. However, this often results in overly complex and difficult-to-train models. To address this issue, we decouple the tasks of avoiding fitting incorrect labels and thoroughly learning clean samples and propose a simple yet highly applicable method called Adaptive Label Refinement (ALR). First, inspired by label refurbishment techniques, we update the original hard labels to soft labels using the model's predictions to reduce the risk of fitting incorrect labels. Then, by introducing the entropy loss, we gradually `harden' the high-confidence soft labels, guiding the model to better learn from clean samples. This approach is simple and efficient, requiring no prior knowledge of noise or auxiliary datasets, making it more accessible compared to existing methods. We validate ALR's effectiveness through experiments on benchmark datasets with artificial label noise (CIFAR-10/100) and real-world datasets with inherent noise (ANIMAL-10N, Clothing1M, WebVision). The results show that ALR outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>RefDrone: A Challenging Benchmark for Referring Expression Comprehension in Drone Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drones have become prevalent robotic platforms with diverse applications, showing significant potential in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI). Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) enables drones to locate objects based on natural language expressions, a crucial capability for Embodied AI. Despite advances in REC for ground-level scenes, aerial views introduce unique challenges including varying viewpoints, occlusions and scale variations. To address this gap, we introduce RefDrone, a REC benchmark for drone scenes. RefDrone reveals three key challenges in REC: 1) multi-scale and small-scale target detection; 2) multi-target and no-target samples; 3) complex environment with rich contextual expressions. To efficiently construct this dataset, we develop RDAgent (referring drone annotation framework with multi-agent system), a semi-automated annotation tool for REC tasks. RDAgent ensures high-quality contextual expressions and reduces annotation cost. Furthermore, we propose Number GroundingDINO (NGDINO), a novel method designed to handle multi-target and no-target cases. NGDINO explicitly learns and utilizes the number of objects referred to in the expression. Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art REC methods demonstrate that NGDINO achieves superior performance on both the proposed RefDrone and the existing gRefCOCO datasets. The dataset and code will be publicly at https://github.com/sunzc-sunny/refdrone.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces ViNet-S, a 36MB model based on the ViNet architecture with a U-Net design, featuring a lightweight decoder that significantly reduces model size and parameters without compromising performance. Additionally, ViNet-A (148MB) incorporates spatio-temporal action localization (STAL) features, differing from traditional video saliency models that use action classification backbones. Our studies show that an ensemble of ViNet-S and ViNet-A, by averaging predicted saliency maps, achieves state-of-the-art performance on three visual-only and six audio-visual saliency datasets, outperforming transformer-based models in both parameter efficiency and real-time performance, with ViNet-S reaching over 1000fps.</description>

Abstract: Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for people aged 5-29, resulting in about 1.19 million deaths each year. To reduce these fatalities, it is essential to address human errors like speeding, drunk driving, and distractions. Additionally, faster accident detection and quicker medical response can help save lives. We propose an accident detection framework that combines a rule-based approach with a learning-based one. We introduce a dataset of real-world highway accidents featuring high-speed crash sequences. It includes 294,924 labeled 2D boxes, 93,012 labeled 3D boxes, and track IDs across 48,144 frames captured at 10 Hz using four roadside cameras and LiDAR sensors. The dataset covers ten object classes and is released in the OpenLABEL format. Our experiments and analysis demonstrate the reliability of our method.</description>

      <title>Exploring Linear Attention Alternative for Single Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based single-image super-resolution (SISR) technology focuses on enhancing low-resolution (LR) images into high-resolution (HR) ones. Although significant progress has been made, challenges remain in computational complexity and quality, particularly in remote sensing image processing. To address these issues, we propose our Omni-Scale RWKV Super-Resolution (OmniRWKVSR) model which presents a novel approach that combines the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture with feature extraction techniques such as Visual RWKV Spatial Mixing (VRSM) and Visual RWKV Channel Mixing (VRCM), aiming to overcome the limitations of existing methods and achieve superior SISR performance. This work has proved able to provide effective solutions for high-quality image reconstruction. Under the 4x Super-Resolution tasks, compared to the MambaIR model, we achieved an average improvement of 0.26% in PSNR and 0.16% in SSIM.</description>

      <title>TROI: Cross-Subject Pretraining with Sparse Voxel Selection for Enhanced fMRI Visual Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) visual decoding involves decoding the original image from brain signals elicited by visual stimuli. This often relies on manually labeled ROIs (Regions of Interest) to select brain voxels. However, these ROIs can contain redundant information and noise, reducing decoding performance. Additionally, the lack of automated ROI labeling methods hinders the practical application of fMRI visual decoding technology, especially for new subjects. This work presents TROI (Trainable Region of Interest), a novel two-stage, data-driven ROI labeling method for cross-subject fMRI decoding tasks, particularly when subject samples are limited. TROI leverages labeled ROIs in the dataset to pretrain an image decoding backbone on a cross-subject dataset, enabling efficient optimization of the input layer for new subjects without retraining the entire model from scratch. In the first stage, we introduce a voxel selection method that combines sparse mask training and low-pass filtering to quickly generate the voxel mask and determine input layer dimensions. In the second stage, we apply a learning rate rewinding strategy to fine-tune the input layer for downstream tasks. Experimental results on the same small sample dataset as the baseline method for brain visual retrieval and reconstruction tasks show that our voxel selection method surpasses the state-of-the-art method MindEye2 with an annotated ROI mask.</description>

      <title>Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning of Segment Anything Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation is an important analysis task for biomedical images, enabling the study of individual organelles, cells or organs. Deep learning has massively improved segmentation methods, but challenges remain in generalization to new conditions, requiring costly data annotation. Vision foundation models, such as Segment Anything Model (SAM), address this issue through broad segmentation capabilities. However, these models still require finetuning on annotated data, although with less annotations, to achieve optimal results for new conditions. As a downside, they require more computational resources. This makes parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) relevant for their application. We contribute the first comprehensive study of PEFT for SAM applied to biomedical segmentation by evaluating 9 PEFT methods on diverse datasets. We also provide an implementation of QLoRA for vision transformers and a new approach for resource-efficient finetuning of SAM. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/peft-sam.</description>

      <title>MQuant: Unleashing the Inference Potential of Multimodal Large Language Models via Full Static Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered widespread attention due to their ability to understand multimodal input. However, their large parameter sizes and substantial computational demands severely hinder their practical deployment and application.While quantization is an effective way to reduce model size and inference latency, its application to MLLMs remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MQuant, a post-training quantization (PTQ) framework designed to tackle the unique challenges of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Conventional quantization often struggles with MLLMs because of (a) high inference latency from large visual token counts, (b) distributional disparities between visual and textual tokens, and (c) extreme outliers introduced by Hadamard-based transformations. To address these issues, MQuant introduces: Modality-Specific Static Quantization (MSQ), assigning distinct static scales for visual vs. textual tokens; Attention-Invariant Flexible Switching (AIFS), reordering tokens to preserve casual attention while eliminating expensive token-wise scale computations; Rotation Magnitude Suppression (RMS), mitigating weight outliers arising from online Hadamard rotations. On five mainstream MLLMs (including Qwen-VL, MiniCPM-V, CogVLM2), MQuant under W4A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (&lt;1% degradation) while reducing inference latency by up to 30%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ baselines. Our MQuant effectively bridges the gap for efficient and accurate MLLMs inference in resource-constrained devices. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>TeST-V: TEst-time Support-set Tuning for Zero-shot Video Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, adapting Vision Language Models (VLMs) to zero-shot visual classification by tuning class embedding with a few prompts (Test-time Prompt Tuning, TPT) or replacing class names with generated visual samples (support-set) has shown promising results. However, TPT cannot avoid the semantic gap between modalities while the support-set cannot be tuned. To this end, we draw on each other's strengths and propose a novel framework namely TEst-time Support-set Tuning for zero-shot Video Classification (TEST-V). It first dilates the support-set with multiple prompts (Multi-prompting Support-set Dilation, MSD) and then erodes the support-set via learnable weights to mine key cues dynamically (Temporal-aware Support-set Erosion, TSE). Specifically, i) MSD expands the support samples for each class based on multiple prompts enquired from LLMs to enrich the diversity of the support-set. ii) TSE tunes the support-set with factorized learnable weights according to the temporal prediction consistency in a self-supervised manner to dig pivotal supporting cues for each class. $\textbf{TEST-V}$ achieves state-of-the-art results across four benchmarks and has good interpretability for the support-set dilation and erosion.</description>

      <title>CAT Pruning: Cluster-Aware Token Pruning For Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized generative tasks, especially in the domain of text-to-image synthesis; however, their iterative denoising process demands substantial computational resources. In this paper, we present a novel acceleration strategy that integrates token-level pruning with caching techniques to tackle this computational challenge. By employing noise relative magnitude, we identify significant token changes across denoising iterations. Additionally, we enhance token selection by incorporating spatial clustering and ensuring distributional balance. Our experiments demonstrate reveal a 50%-60% reduction in computational costs while preserving the performance of the model, thereby markedly increasing the efficiency of diffusion models.

      <title>SatMamba: Development of Foundation Models for Remote Sensing Imagery Using State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models refer to deep learning models pretrained on large unlabeled datasets through self-supervised algorithms. In the Earth science and remote sensing communities, there is growing interest in transforming the use of Earth observation data, including satellite and aerial imagery, through foundation models. Various foundation models have been developed for remote sensing, such as those for multispectral, high-resolution, and hyperspectral images, and have demonstrated superior performance on various downstream tasks compared to traditional supervised models. These models are evolving rapidly, with capabilities to handle multispectral, multitemporal, and multisensor data. Most studies use masked autoencoders in combination with Vision Transformers (ViTs) as the backbone for pretraining. While the models showed promising performance, ViTs face challenges, such as quadratic computational scaling with input length, which may limit performance on multiband and multitemporal data with long sequences. This research aims to address these challenges by proposing SatMamba, a new pretraining framework that combines masked autoencoders with State Space Model, offering linear computational scaling. Experiments on high-resolution imagery across various downstream tasks show promising results, paving the way for more efficient foundation models and unlocking the full potential of Earth observation data.

      <title>MambaGlue: Fast and Robust Local Feature Matching With Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, robust matching methods using deep learning-based approaches have been actively studied and improved in computer vision tasks. However, there remains a persistent demand for both robust and fast matching techniques. To address this, we propose a novel Mamba-based local feature matching approach, called MambaGlue, where Mamba is an emerging state-of-the-art architecture rapidly gaining recognition for its superior speed in both training and inference, and promising performance compared with Transformer architectures. In particular, we propose two modules: a) MambaAttention mixer to simultaneously and selectively understand the local and global context through the Mamba-based self-attention structure and b) deep confidence score regressor, which is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based architecture that evaluates a score indicating how confidently matching predictions correspond to the ground-truth correspondences. Consequently, our MambaGlue achieves a balance between robustness and efficiency in real-world applications. As verified on various public datasets, we demonstrate that our MambaGlue yields a substantial performance improvement over baseline approaches while maintaining fast inference speed. Our code will be available on https://github.com/url-kaist/MambaGlue</description>

      <title>Evaluation of End-to-End Continuous Spanish Lipreading in Different Data Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual speech recognition remains an open research problem where different challenges must be considered by dispensing with the auditory sense, such as visual ambiguities, the inter-personal variability among speakers, and the complex modeling of silence. Nonetheless, recent remarkable results have been achieved in the field thanks to the availability of large-scale databases and the use of powerful attention mechanisms. Besides, multiple languages apart from English are nowadays a focus of interest. This paper presents noticeable advances in automatic continuous lipreading for Spanish. First, an end-to-end system based on the hybrid CTC/Attention architecture is presented. Experiments are conducted on two corpora of disparate nature, reaching state-of-the-art results that significantly improve the best performance obtained to date for both databases. In addition, a thorough ablation study is carried out, where it is studied how the different components that form the architecture influence the quality of speech recognition. Then, a rigorous error analysis is carried out to investigate the different factors that could affect the learning of the automatic system. Finally, a new Spanish lipreading benchmark is consolidated. Code and trained models are available at https://github.com/david-gimeno/evaluating-end2end-spanish-lipreading.</description>

      <title>A framework for river connectivity classification using temporal image processing and attention based neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the connectivity of water in rivers and streams is essential for effective water resource management. Increased extreme weather events associated with climate change can result in alterations to river and stream connectivity. While traditional stream flow gauges are costly to deploy and limited to large river bodies, trail camera methods are a low-cost and easily deployed alternative to collect hourly data. Image capturing, however requires stream ecologists to manually curate (select and label) tens of thousands of images per year. To improve this workflow, we developed an automated instream trail camera image classification system consisting of three parts: (1) image processing, (2) image augmentation and (3) machine learning. The image preprocessing consists of seven image quality filters, foliage-based luma variance reduction, resizing and bottom-center cropping. Images are balanced using variable amount of generative augmentation using diffusion models and then passed to a machine learning classification model in labeled form. By using the vision transformer architecture and temporal image enhancement in our framework, we are able to increase the 75% base accuracy to 90% for a new unseen site image. We make use of a dataset captured and labeled by staff from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection between 2018-2020. Our results indicate that a combination of temporal image processing and attention-based models are effective at classifying unseen river connectivity images.</description>

      <title>Video Latent Flow Matching: Optimal Polynomial Projections for Video Interpolation and Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00500v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers an efficient video modeling process called Video Latent Flow Matching (VLFM). Unlike prior works, which randomly sampled latent patches for video generation, our method relies on current strong pre-trained image generation models, modeling a certain caption-guided flow of latent patches that can be decoded to time-dependent video frames. We first speculate multiple images of a video are differentiable with respect to time in some latent space. Based on this conjecture, we introduce the HiPPO framework to approximate the optimal projection for polynomials to generate the probability path. Our approach gains the theoretical benefits of the bounded universal approximation error and timescale robustness. Moreover, VLFM processes the interpolation and extrapolation abilities for video generation with arbitrary frame rates. We conduct experiments on several text-to-video datasets to showcase the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Vision-Language Modeling in PET/CT for Visual Grounding of Positive Findings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models can connect the text description of an object to its specific location in an image through visual grounding. This has potential applications in enhanced radiology reporting. However, these models require large annotated image-text datasets, which are lacking for PET/CT. We developed an automated pipeline to generate weak labels linking PET/CT report descriptions to their image locations and used it to train a 3D vision-language visual grounding model. Our pipeline finds positive findings in PET/CT reports by identifying mentions of SUVmax and axial slice numbers. From 25,578 PET/CT exams, we extracted 11,356 sentence-label pairs. Using this data, we trained ConTEXTual Net 3D, which integrates text embeddings from a large language model with a 3D nnU-Net via token-level cross-attention. The model's performance was compared against LLMSeg, a 2.5D version of ConTEXTual Net, and two nuclear medicine physicians. The weak-labeling pipeline accurately identified lesion locations in 98% of cases (246/251), with 7.5% requiring boundary adjustments. ConTEXTual Net 3D achieved an F1 score of 0.80, outperforming LLMSeg (F1=0.22) and the 2.5D model (F1=0.53), though it underperformed both physicians (F1=0.94 and 0.91). The model achieved better performance on FDG (F1=0.78) and DCFPyL (F1=0.75) exams, while performance dropped on DOTATE (F1=0.58) and Fluciclovine (F1=0.66). The model performed consistently across lesion sizes but showed reduced accuracy on lesions with low uptake. Our novel weak labeling pipeline accurately produced an annotated dataset of PET/CT image-text pairs, facilitating the development of 3D visual grounding models. ConTEXTual Net 3D significantly outperformed other models but fell short of the performance of nuclear medicine physicians. Our study suggests that even larger datasets may be needed to close this performance gap.</description>

      <title>Work-Efficient Parallel Non-Maximum Suppression Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of object detection, sliding-window classifiers and single-shot Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) meta-architectures typically yield multiple overlapping candidate windows with similar high scores around the true location of a particular object. Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) is the process of selecting a single representative candidate within this cluster of detections, so as to obtain a unique detection per object appearing on a given picture. In this paper, we present a highly scalable NMS algorithm for embedded GPU architectures that is designed from scratch to handle workloads featuring thousands of simultaneous detections on a given picture. Our kernels are directly applicable to other sequential NMS algorithms such as FeatureNMS, Soft-NMS or AdaptiveNMS that share the inner workings of the classic greedy NMS method. The obtained performance results show that our parallel NMS algorithm is capable of clustering 1024 simultaneous detected objects per frame in roughly 1 ms on both NVIDIA Tegra X1 and NVIDIA Tegra X2 on-die GPUs, while taking 2 ms on NVIDIA Tegra K1. Furthermore, our proposed parallel greedy NMS algorithm yields a 14x-40x speed up when compared to state-of-the-art NMS methods that require learning a CNN from annotated data.</description>

      <title>CAD: Confidence-Aware Adaptive Displacement for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation aims to leverage minimal expert annotations, yet remains confronted by challenges in maintaining high-quality consistency learning. Excessive perturbations can degrade alignment and hinder precise decision boundaries, especially in regions with uncertain predictions. In this paper, we introduce Confidence-Aware Adaptive Displacement (CAD), a framework that selectively identifies and replaces the largest low-confidence regions with high-confidence patches. By dynamically adjusting both the maximum allowable replacement size and the confidence threshold throughout training, CAD progressively refines the segmentation quality without overwhelming the learning process. Experimental results on public medical datasets demonstrate that CAD effectively enhances segmentation quality, establishing new state-of-the-art accuracy in this field. The source code will be released after the paper is published.</description>

      <title>Milmer: a Framework for Multiple Instance Learning based Multimodal Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotions play a crucial role in human behavior and decision-making, making emotion recognition a key area of interest in human-computer interaction (HCI). This study addresses the challenges of emotion recognition by integrating facial expression analysis with electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, introducing a novel multimodal framework-Milmer. The proposed framework employs a transformer-based fusion approach to effectively integrate visual and physiological modalities. It consists of an EEG preprocessing module, a facial feature extraction and balancing module, and a cross-modal fusion module. To enhance visual feature extraction, we fine-tune a pre-trained Swin Transformer on emotion-related datasets. Additionally, a cross-attention mechanism is introduced to balance token representation across modalities, ensuring effective feature integration. A key innovation of this work is the adoption of a multiple instance learning (MIL) approach, which extracts meaningful information from multiple facial expression images over time, capturing critical temporal dynamics often overlooked in previous studies. Extensive experiments conducted on the DEAP dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.72% in the four-class emotion recognition task. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of each module, highlighting the significance of advanced feature extraction and fusion strategies in enhancing emotion recognition performance.

      <title>Complex Wavelet Mutual Information Loss: A Multi-Scale Loss Function for Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep neural networks have significantly enhanced the performance of semantic segmentation. However, class imbalance and instance imbalance remain persistent challenges, where smaller instances and thin boundaries are often overshadowed by larger structures. To address the multiscale nature of segmented objects, various models have incorporated mechanisms such as spatial attention and feature pyramid networks. Despite these advancements, most loss functions are still primarily pixel-wise, while regional and boundary-focused loss functions often incur high computational costs or are restricted to small-scale regions. To address this limitation, we propose complex wavelet mutual information (CWMI) loss, a novel loss function that leverages mutual information from subband images decomposed by a complex steerable pyramid. The complex steerable pyramid captures features across multiple orientations and preserves structural similarity across scales. Meanwhile, mutual information is well-suited for capturing high-dimensional directional features and exhibits greater noise robustness. Extensive experiments on diverse segmentation datasets demonstrate that CWMI loss achieves significant improvements in both pixel-wise accuracy and topological metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods, while introducing minimal computational overhead.

      <title>Generating crossmodal gene expression from cancer histopathology improves multimodal AI predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging research has highlighted that artificial intelligence based multimodal fusion of digital pathology and transcriptomic features can improve cancer diagnosis (grading/subtyping) and prognosis (survival risk) prediction. However, such direct fusion for joint decision is impractical in real clinical settings, where histopathology is still the gold standard for diagnosis and transcriptomic tests are rarely requested, at least in the public healthcare system. With our novel diffusion based crossmodal generative AI model PathoGen, we show that genomic expressions synthesized from digital histopathology jointly predicts cancer grading and patient survival risk with high accuracy (state-of-the-art performance), certainty (through conformal coverage guarantee) and interpretability (through distributed attention maps). PathoGen code is available for open use by the research community through GitHub at https://github.com/Samiran-Dey/PathoGen.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Forward-Forward: A Training Algorithm of Vision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although backpropagation is widely accepted as a training algorithm for artificial neural networks, researchers are always looking for inspiration from the brain to find ways with potentially better performance. Forward-Forward is a new training algorithm that is more similar to what occurs in the brain, although there is a significant performance gap compared to backpropagation. In the Forward-Forward algorithm, the loss functions are placed after each layer, and the updating of a layer is done using two local forward passes and one local backward pass. Forward-Forward is in its early stages and has been designed and evaluated on simple multi-layer perceptron networks to solve image classification tasks. In this work, we have extended the use of this algorithm to a more complex and modern network, namely the Vision Transformer. Inspired by insights from contrastive learning, we have attempted to revise this algorithm, leading to the introduction of Contrastive Forward-Forward. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm performs significantly better than the baseline Forward-Forward leading to an increase of up to 10% in accuracy and boosting the convergence speed by 5 to 20 times on Vision Transformer. Furthermore, if we take Cross Entropy as the baseline loss function in backpropagation, it will be demonstrated that the proposed modifications to the baseline Forward-Forward reduce its performance gap compared to backpropagation on Vision Transformer, and even outperforms it in certain conditions, such as inaccurate supervision.</description>

      <title>Fast Vision Mamba: Pooling Spatial Dimensions for Accelerated Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) with selective scan (Mamba) have been adapted into efficient vision models. Mamba, unlike Vision Transformers, achieves linear complexity for token interactions through a recurrent hidden state process. This sequential processing is enhanced by a parallel scan algorithm, which reduces the computational time of recurrent steps from $L$ sequential steps to $log(L)$ parallel steps with respect to the number of input tokens ($L$). In this work, we propose Fast Vision Mamba (FastVim), that further reduces the computational time of the SSM block by reducing the number of recurrent steps in Vision Mamba models while still retaining model performance. By alternately pooling tokens along image dimensions across Mamba blocks, we obtain a 2$\times$ reduction in the number of parallel steps in SSM block. Our model offers up to $72.5\%$ speedup in inference speed compared to baseline Vision Mamba models on high resolution (2048$\times$2048) images. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with dramatically improved throughput in a range of tasks such as image classification, cell perturbation prediction, segmentation, and object detection.

      <title>DesCLIP: Robust Continual Adaptation via General Attribute Descriptions for Pretrained Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual adaptation of vision-language models (VLMs) focuses on leveraging cross-modal pretrained knowledge to incrementally adapt for expanding downstream tasks and datasets, while tackling the challenge of knowledge forgetting. Existing research often focuses on connecting visual features with specific class text in downstream tasks, overlooking the latent relationships between general and specialized knowledge. Our findings reveal that forcing models to optimize inappropriate visual-text matches exacerbates forgetting of VLMs. To tackle this issue, we propose DesCLIP, which leverages general attribute (GA) descriptions to guide the understanding of specific class objects, enabling VLMs to establish robust \textit{vision-GA-class} trilateral associations rather than relying solely on \textit{vision-class} connections. Specifically, we introduce a language assistant to generate concrete GA description candidates via proper request prompts. Then, an anchor-based embedding filter is designed to obtain highly relevant GA description embeddings, which are leveraged as the paired text embeddings for visual-textual instance matching, thereby tuning the visual encoder. Correspondingly, the class text embeddings are gradually calibrated to align with these shared GA description embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advancements and efficacy of our proposed method, with comprehensive empirical evaluations highlighting its superior performance compared to existing pretrained and VLM-based continual learning methods.</description>

      <title>Self-Prompt SAM: Medical Image Segmentation via Automatic Prompt SAM Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance and brought a range of unexplored capabilities to natural image segmentation tasks. However, as a very important branch of image segmentation, the performance of SAM remains uncertain when applied to medical image segmentation due to the significant differences between natural images and medical images. Meanwhile, it is harsh to meet the SAM's requirements of extra prompts provided, such as points or boxes to specify medical regions. In this paper, we propose a novel self-prompt SAM adaptation framework for medical image segmentation, named Self-Prompt-SAM. We design a multi-scale prompt generator combined with the image encoder in SAM to generate auxiliary masks. Then, we use the auxiliary masks to generate bounding boxes as box prompts and use Distance Transform to select the most central points as point prompts. Meanwhile, we design a 3D depth-fused adapter (DfusedAdapter) and inject the DFusedAdapter into each transformer in the image encoder and mask decoder to enable pre-trained 2D SAM models to extract 3D information and adapt to 3D medical images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms nnUNet by 2.3% on AMOS2022, 1.6% on ACDCand 0.5% on Synapse datasets.</description>

      <title>MedConv: Convolutions Beat Transformers on Long-Tailed Bone Density Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bone density prediction via CT scans to estimate T-scores is crucial, providing a more precise assessment of bone health compared to traditional methods like X-ray bone density tests, which lack spatial resolution and the ability to detect localized changes. However, CT-based prediction faces two major challenges: the high computational complexity of transformer-based architectures, which limits their deployment in portable and clinical settings, and the imbalanced, long-tailed distribution of real-world hospital data that skews predictions. To address these issues, we introduce MedConv, a convolutional model for bone density prediction that outperforms transformer models with lower computational demands. We also adapt Bal-CE loss and post-hoc logit adjustment to improve class balance. Extensive experiments on our AustinSpine dataset shows that our approach achieves up to 21% improvement in accuracy and 20% in ROC AUC over previous state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Zeroth-order Informed Fine-Tuning for Diffusion Model: A Recursive Likelihood Ratio Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probabilistic diffusion model (DM), generating content by inferencing through a recursive chain structure, has emerged as a powerful framework for visual generation. After pre-training on enormous unlabeled data, the model needs to be properly aligned to meet requirements for downstream applications. How to efficiently align the foundation DM is a crucial task. Contemporary methods are either based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) or truncated Backpropagation (BP). However, RL and truncated BP suffer from low sample efficiency and biased gradient estimation respectively, resulting in limited improvement or, even worse, complete training failure. To overcome the challenges, we propose the Recursive Likelihood Ratio (RLR) optimizer, a zeroth-order informed fine-tuning paradigm for DM. The zeroth-order gradient estimator enables the computation graph rearrangement within the recursive diffusive chain, making the RLR's gradient estimator an unbiased one with the lower variance than other methods. We provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of the RLR. Extensive experiments are conducted on image and video generation tasks to validate the superiority of the RLR. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt technique that is natural for the RLR to achieve a synergistic effect.</description>

      <title>EmoTalkingGaussian: Continuous Emotion-conditioned Talking Head Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting-based talking head synthesis has recently gained attention for its ability to render high-fidelity images with real-time inference speed. However, since it is typically trained on only a short video that lacks the diversity in facial emotions, the resultant talking heads struggle to represent a wide range of emotions. To address this issue, we propose a lip-aligned emotional face generator and leverage it to train our EmoTalkingGaussian model. It is able to manipulate facial emotions conditioned on continuous emotion values (i.e., valence and arousal); while retaining synchronization of lip movements with input audio. Additionally, to achieve the accurate lip synchronization for in-the-wild audio, we introduce a self-supervised learning method that leverages a text-to-speech network and a visual-audio synchronization network. We experiment our EmoTalkingGaussian on publicly available videos and have obtained better results than state-of-the-arts in terms of image quality (measured in PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), emotion expression (measured in V-RMSE, A-RMSE, V-SA, A-SA, Emotion Accuracy), and lip synchronization (measured in LMD, Sync-E, Sync-C), respectively.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the Modality Gap: Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Detection with Multi-modal Prototypes and Image Bias Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing vision-language model (VLM)-based methods for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection typically rely on similarity scores between input images and in-distribution (ID) text prototypes. However, the modality gap between image and text often results in high false positive rates, as OOD samples can exhibit high similarity to ID text prototypes. To mitigate the impact of this modality gap, we propose incorporating ID image prototypes along with ID text prototypes. We present theoretical analysis and empirical evidence indicating that this approach enhances VLM-based OOD detection performance without any additional training. To further reduce the gap between image and text, we introduce a novel few-shot tuning framework, SUPREME, comprising biased prompts generation (BPG) and image-text consistency (ITC) modules. BPG enhances image-text fusion and improves generalization by conditioning ID text prototypes on the Gaussian-based estimated image domain bias; ITC reduces the modality gap by minimizing intra- and inter-modal distances. Moreover, inspired by our theoretical and empirical findings, we introduce a novel OOD score $S_{\textit{GMP}}$, leveraging uni- and cross-modal similarities. Finally, we present extensive experiments to demonstrate that SUPREME consistently outperforms existing VLM-based OOD detection methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision with diverse applications, ranging from autonomous systems to medical imaging. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used benchmark to evaluate the performance of classification models on small-scale, multi-class datasets. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art results; however, they often suffer from overfitting and suboptimal feature representation when applied to challenging datasets like CIFAR-10. In this paper, we propose an enhanced CNN architecture that integrates deeper convolutional blocks, batch normalization, and dropout regularization to achieve superior performance. The proposed model achieves a test accuracy of 84.95%, outperforming baseline CNN architectures. Through detailed ablation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the enhancements and analyze the hierarchical feature representations. This work highlights the potential of refined CNN architectures for tackling small-scale image classification problems effectively.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Synergies: Unveiling the Potential of Motion-Aware Fusion Networks in Handling Dynamic and Static ReID Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating the complexities of person re-identification (ReID) in varied surveillance scenarios, particularly when occlusions occur, poses significant challenges. We introduce an innovative Motion-Aware Fusion (MOTAR-FUSE) network that utilizes motion cues derived from static imagery to significantly enhance ReID capabilities. This network incorporates a dual-input visual adapter capable of processing both images and videos, thereby facilitating more effective feature extraction. A unique aspect of our approach is the integration of a motion consistency task, which empowers the motion-aware transformer to adeptly capture the dynamics of human motion. This technique substantially improves the recognition of features in scenarios where occlusions are prevalent, thereby advancing the ReID process. Our comprehensive evaluations across multiple ReID benchmarks, including holistic, occluded, and video-based scenarios, demonstrate that our MOTAR-FUSE network achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>High-Order Matching for One-Step Shortcut Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-step shortcut diffusion models [Frans, Hafner, Levine and Abbeel, ICLR 2025] have shown potential in vision generation, but their reliance on first-order trajectory supervision is fundamentally limited. The Shortcut model's simplistic velocity-only approach fails to capture intrinsic manifold geometry, leading to erratic trajectories, poor geometric alignment, and instability-especially in high-curvature regions. These shortcomings stem from its inability to model mid-horizon dependencies or complex distributional features, leaving it ill-equipped for robust generative modeling. In this work, we introduce HOMO (High-Order Matching for One-Step Shortcut Diffusion), a game-changing framework that leverages high-order supervision to revolutionize distribution transportation. By incorporating acceleration, jerk, and beyond, HOMO not only fixes the flaws of the Shortcut model but also achieves unprecedented smoothness, stability, and geometric precision. Theoretically, we prove that HOMO's high-order supervision ensures superior approximation accuracy, outperforming first-order methods. Empirically, HOMO dominates in complex settings, particularly in high-curvature regions where the Shortcut model struggles. Our experiments show that HOMO delivers smoother trajectories and better distributional alignment, setting a new standard for one-step generative models.</description>

      <title>TMI-CLNet: Triple-Modal Interaction Network for Chronic Liver Disease Prognosis From Imaging, Clinical, and Radiomic Data Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic liver disease represents a significant health challenge worldwide and accurate prognostic evaluations are essential for personalized treatment plans. Recent evidence suggests that integrating multimodal data, such as computed tomography imaging, radiomic features, and clinical information, can provide more comprehensive prognostic information. However, modalities have an inherent heterogeneity, and incorporating additional modalities may exacerbate the challenges of heterogeneous data fusion. Moreover, existing multimodal fusion methods often struggle to adapt to richer medical modalities, making it difficult to capture inter-modal relationships. To overcome these limitations, We present the Triple-Modal Interaction Chronic Liver Network (TMI-CLNet). Specifically, we develop an Intra-Modality Aggregation module and a Triple-Modal Cross-Attention Fusion module, which are designed to eliminate intra-modality redundancy and extract cross-modal information, respectively. Furthermore, we design a Triple-Modal Feature Fusion loss function to align feature representations across modalities. Extensive experiments on the liver prognosis dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art unimodal models and other multi-modal techniques. Our code is available at https://github.com/Mysterwll/liver.git.</description>

      <title>S2CFormer: Reorienting Learned Image Compression from Spatial Interaction to Channel Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have achieved significant success in learned image compression (LIC), with Swin Transformers emerging as the mainstream choice for nonlinear transforms. A common belief is that their sophisticated spatial operations contribute most to their efficacy. However, the crucial role of the feed-forward network (FFN) based Channel Aggregation module within the transformer architecture has been largely overlooked, and the over-design of spatial operations leads to a suboptimal trade-off between decoding latency and R-D performance. In this paper, we reevaluate the key factors behind the competence of transformers in LIC. By replacing spatial operations with identity mapping, we are surprised to find that channel operations alone can approach the R-D performance of the leading methods. This solid lower bound of performance emphasizes that the presence of channel aggregation is more essential for the LIC model to achieve competitive performance, while the previously complex spatial interactions are partly redundant. Based on this insight, we initiate the "S2CFormer" paradigm, a general architecture that reorients the focus of LIC from Spatial Interaction to Channel Aggregation. We present two instantiations of the S2CFormer: S2C-Conv, and S2C-Attention. Each one incorporates a simple operator for spatial interaction and serves as nonlinear transform blocks for our LIC models. Both models demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) R-D performance and significantly faster decoding speed. These results also motivate further exploration of advanced FFN structures to enhance the R-D performance while maintaining model efficiency. With these foundations, we introduce S2C-Hybrid, an enhanced LIC model that combines the strengths of different S2CFormer instantiations. This model outperforms all the existing methods on several datasets, setting a new benchmark for efficient and high-performance LIC.</description>

      <title>PhiP-G: Physics-Guided Text-to-3D Compositional Scene Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-3D asset generation has achieved significant optimization under the supervision of 2D diffusion priors. However, when dealing with compositional scenes, existing methods encounter several challenges: 1). failure to ensure that composite scene layouts comply with physical laws; 2). difficulty in accurately capturing the assets and relationships described in complex scene descriptions; 3). limited autonomous asset generation capabilities among layout approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs). To avoid these compromises, we propose a novel framework for compositional scene generation, PhiP-G, which seamlessly integrates generation techniques with layout guidance based on a world model. Leveraging LLM-based agents, PhiP-G analyzes the complex scene description to generate a scene graph, and integrating a multimodal 2D generation agent and a 3D Gaussian generation method for targeted assets creation. For the stage of layout, PhiP-G employs a physical pool with adhesion capabilities and a visual supervision agent, forming a world model for layout prediction and planning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhiP-G significantly enhances the generation quality and physical rationality of the compositional scenes. Notably, PhiP-G attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in CLIP scores, achieves parity with the leading methods in generation quality as measured by the T$^3$Bench, and improves efficiency by 24x.</description>

      <title>VIKSER: Visual Knowledge-Driven Self-Reinforcing Reasoning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual reasoning refers to the task of solving questions about visual information. Current visual reasoning methods typically employ pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) strategies or deep neural network approaches. However, existing efforts are constrained by limited reasoning interpretability, while hindering by the phenomenon of underspecification in the question text. Additionally, the absence of fine-grained visual knowledge limits the precise understanding of subject behavior in visual reasoning tasks. To address these issues, we propose VIKSER (Visual Knowledge-Driven Self-Reinforcing Reasoning Framework). Specifically, VIKSER, trained using knowledge distilled from large language models, extracts fine-grained visual knowledge with the assistance of visual relationship detection techniques. Subsequently, VIKSER utilizes fine-grained visual knowledge to paraphrase the question with underspecification. Additionally, we design a novel prompting method called Chain-of-Evidence (CoE), which leverages the power of ``evidence for reasoning'' to endow VIKSER with interpretable reasoning capabilities. Meanwhile, the integration of self-reflection technology empowers VIKSER with the ability to learn and improve from its mistakes. Experiments conducted on widely used datasets demonstrate that VIKSER achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in relevant tasks.</description>

      <title>MINT: Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via Token Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucination has been a long-standing and inevitable problem that hinders the application of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in domains that require high reliability. Various methods focus on improvement depending on data annotations or training strategies, yet place less emphasis on LLM's inherent problems. To fill this gap, we delve into the attention mechanism of the decoding process in the LVLM. Intriguingly, our investigation uncovers the prevalent attention redundancy within the hierarchical architecture of the LVLM, manifesting as overextended image processing in deep layers and an overabundance of non-essential image tokens. Stemming from the observation, we thus propose MINT, a novel training-free decoding strategy, MItigating hallucinations via tokeN reducTion. Specifically, we dynamically intensify the LVLM's local perception capability by masking its attention to irrelevant image tokens. In addition, we use contrastive decoding that pushes the model to focus more on those key image regions. Our full method aims to guide the model in concentrating more on key visual elements during generation. Extensive experimental results on several popular public benchmarks show that our approach achieves a 4% improvement in mitigating hallucinations caused by distracted perception compared to original models. Meanwhile, our approach is demonstrated to make the model perceive 5% more visual points even though we reduce a suite of image tokens.</description>

      <title>Vision and Language Reference Prompt into SAM for Few-shot Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a large-scale segmentation model that enables powerful zero-shot capabilities with flexible prompts. While SAM can segment any object in zero-shot, it requires user-provided prompts for each target image and does not attach any label information to masks. Few-shot segmentation models addressed these issues by inputting annotated reference images as prompts to SAM and can segment specific objects in target images without user-provided prompts. Previous SAM-based few-shot segmentation models only use annotated reference images as prompts, resulting in limited accuracy due to a lack of reference information. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot segmentation model, Vision and Language reference Prompt into SAM (VLP-SAM), that utilizes the visual information of the reference images and the semantic information of the text labels by inputting not only images but also language as reference information. In particular, VLP-SAM is a simple and scalable structure with minimal learnable parameters, which inputs prompt embeddings with vision-language information into SAM using a multimodal vision-language model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of VLP-SAM, we conducted experiments on the PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets, and achieved high performance in the few-shot segmentation task, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art model by a large margin (6.3% and 9.5% in mIoU, respectively). Furthermore, VLP-SAM demonstrates its generality in unseen objects that are not included in the training data. Our code is available at https://github.com/kosukesakurai1/VLP-SAM.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Progressive Attention Model for EEG Classification in Rapid Serial Visual Presentation Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a type of multi-dimensional sequential data, the spatial and temporal dependencies of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals should be further investigated. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal progressive attention model (STPAM) to improve EEG classification in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) tasks. STPAM first adopts three distinct spatial experts to learn the spatial topological information of brain regions progressively, which is used to minimize the interference of irrelevant brain regions. Concretely, the former expert filters out EEG electrodes in the relative brain regions to be used as prior knowledge for the next expert, ensuring that the subsequent experts gradually focus their attention on information from significant EEG electrodes. This process strengthens the effect of the important brain regions. Then, based on the above-obtained feature sequence with spatial information, three temporal experts are adopted to capture the temporal dependence by progressively assigning attention to the crucial EEG slices. Except for the above EEG classification method, in this paper, we build a novel Infrared RSVP EEG Dataset (IRED) which is based on dim infrared images with small targets for the first time, and conduct extensive experiments on it. The results show that our STPAM can achieve better performance than all the compared methods.</description>

      <title>A method for estimating forest carbon storage distribution density via artificial intelligence generated content model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forest is the most significant land-based carbon storage mechanism. The forest carbon sink can effectively decrease the atmospheric CO2 concentration and mitigate climate change. Remote sensing estimation not only ensures high accuracy of data, but also enables large-scale area observation. Optical images provide the possibility for long-term monitoring, which is a potential issue in the future carbon storage estimation research. We chose Huize County, Qujing City, Yunnan Province, China as the study area, took GF-1 WFV satellite image as the data, introduced the KD-VGG module to extract the initial features, and proposed the improved implicit diffusion model (IIDM). The results showed that: (1) The VGG-19 module after knowledge distillation can realize the initial feature extraction, reduce the inference time and improve the accuracy in the case of reducing the number of model parameters. (2) The Attention + MLP module was added for feature fusion to obtain the relationship between global and local features and realized the restoration of high-fidelity images in the continuous scale range. (3) The IIDM model proposed in this paper had the highest estimation accuracy, with RMSE of 28.68, which was 13.16 higher than that of the regression model, about 31.45%. In the estimation of carbon storage, the generative model can extract deeper features, and its performance was significantly better than other models. It demonstrated the feasibility of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) in the field of quantitative remote sensing and provided valuable insights for the study of carbon neutralization effect. By combining the actual characteristics of the forest, the regional carbon storage estimation with a resolution of 16-meter was utilized to provide a significant theoretical basis for the formulation of forest carbon sink regulation.</description>

Abstract: Forests function as crucial carbon reservoirs on land, and their carbon sinks can efficiently reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations and mitigate climate change. Currently, the overall trend for monitoring and assessing forest carbon stocks is to integrate ground monitoring sample data with satellite remote sensing imagery. This style of analysis facilitates large-scale observation. However, these techniques require improvement in accuracy. We used GF-1 WFV and Landsat TM images to analyze Huize County, Qujing City, Yunnan Province in China. Using the style transfer method, we introduced Swin Transformer to extract global features through attention mechanisms, converting the carbon stock estimation into an image translation.</description>

      <title>Task-Specific Adaptation with Restricted Model Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of foundational models has greatly improved performance across various downstream tasks, with fine-tuning often yielding even better results. However, existing fine-tuning approaches typically require access to model weights and layers, leading to challenges such as managing multiple model copies or inference pipelines, inefficiencies in edge device optimization, and concerns over proprietary rights, privacy, and exposure to unsafe model variants. In this paper, we address these challenges by exploring "Gray-box" fine-tuning approaches, where the model's architecture and weights remain hidden, allowing only gradient propagation. We introduce a novel yet simple and effective framework that adapts to new tasks using two lightweight learnable modules at the model's input and output. Additionally, we present a less restrictive variant that offers more entry points into the model, balancing performance with model exposure. We evaluate our approaches across several backbones on benchmarks such as text-image alignment, text-video alignment, and sketch-image alignment. Results show that our Gray-box approaches are competitive with full-access fine-tuning methods, despite having limited access to the model.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Semantic Augmentation for Training Generative Adversarial Networks under Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made remarkable achievements in synthesizing images in recent years. Typically, training GANs requires massive data, and the performance of GANs deteriorates significantly when training data is limited. To improve the synthesis performance of GANs in low-data regimes, existing approaches use various data augmentation techniques to enlarge the training sets. However, it is identified that these augmentation techniques may leak or even alter the data distribution. To remedy this, we propose an adversarial semantic augmentation (ASA) technique to enlarge the training data at the semantic level instead of the image level. Concretely, considering semantic features usually encode informative information of images, we estimate the covariance matrices of semantic features for both real and generated images to find meaningful transformation directions. Such directions translate original features to another semantic representation, e.g., changing the backgrounds or expressions of the human face dataset. Moreover, we derive an upper bound of the expected adversarial loss. By optimizing the upper bound, our semantic augmentation is implicitly achieved. Such design avoids redundant sampling of the augmented features and introduces negligible computation overhead, making our approach computation efficient. Extensive experiments on both few-shot and large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method consistently improve the synthesis quality under various data regimes, and further visualized and analytic results suggesting satisfactory versatility of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Environment-Driven Online LiDAR-Camera Extrinsic Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration (LCEC) is the core for data fusion in computer vision. Existing methods typically rely on customized calibration targets or fixed scene types, lacking the flexibility to handle variations in sensor data and environmental contexts. This paper introduces EdO-LCEC, the first environment-driven, online calibration approach that achieves human-like adaptability. Inspired by the human perceptual system, EdO-LCEC incorporates a generalizable scene discriminator to actively interpret environmental conditions, creating multiple virtual cameras that capture detailed spatial and textural information. To overcome cross-modal feature matching challenges between LiDAR and camera, we propose dual-path correspondence matching (DPCM), which leverages both structural and textural consistency to achieve reliable 3D-2D correspondences. Our approach formulates the calibration process as a spatial-temporal joint optimization problem, utilizing global constraints from multiple views and scenes to improve accuracy, particularly in sparse or partially overlapping sensor views. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that EdO-LCEC achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing reliable and precise calibration across diverse, challenging environments.</description>

      <title>VLM-Assisted Continual learning for Visual Question Answering in Self-Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach for solving the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task in autonomous driving by integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with continual learning. In autonomous driving, VQA plays a vital role in enabling the system to understand and reason about its surroundings. However, traditional models often struggle with catastrophic forgetting when sequentially exposed to new driving tasks, such as perception, prediction, and planning, each requiring different forms of knowledge. To address this challenge, we present a novel continual learning framework that combines VLMs with selective memory replay and knowledge distillation, reinforced by task-specific projection layer regularization. The knowledge distillation allows a previously trained model to act as a "teacher" to guide the model through subsequent tasks, minimizing forgetting. Meanwhile, task-specific projection layers calculate the loss based on the divergence of feature representations, ensuring continuity in learning and reducing the shift between tasks. Evaluated on the DriveLM dataset, our framework shows substantial performance improvements, with gains ranging from 21.40% to 32.28% across various metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining continual learning with VLMs in enhancing the resilience and reliability of VQA systems in autonomous driving. We will release our source code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent text-to-image generative models, e.g., Stable Diffusion V3 and Flux, have achieved notable progress. However, these models are strongly restricted to their limited knowledge, a.k.a., their own fixed parameters, that are trained with closed datasets. This leads to significant hallucinations or distortions when facing fine-grained and unseen novel real-world objects, e.g., the appearance of the Tesla Cybertruck. To this end, we present the first real-object-based retrieval-augmented generation framework (RealRAG), which augments fine-grained and unseen novel object generation by learning and retrieving real-world images to overcome the knowledge gaps of generative models. Specifically, to integrate missing memory for unseen novel object generation, we train a reflective retriever by self-reflective contrastive learning, which injects the generator's knowledge into the sef-reflective negatives, ensuring that the retrieved augmented images compensate for the model's missing knowledge. Furthermore, the real-object-based framework integrates fine-grained visual knowledge for the generative models, tackling the distortion problem and improving the realism for fine-grained object generation. Our Real-RAG is superior in its modular application to all types of state-of-the-art text-to-image generative models and also delivers remarkable performance boosts with all of them, such as a gain of 16.18% FID score with the auto-regressive model on the Stanford Car benchmark.</description>

      <title>STAF: Sinusoidal Trainable Activation Functions for Implicit Neural Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling continuous signals. The spectral bias of ReLU-based networks is a well-established limitation, restricting their ability to capture fine-grained details in target signals. While previous works have attempted to mitigate this issue through frequency-based encodings or architectural modifications, these approaches often introduce additional complexity and do not fully address the underlying challenge of learning high-frequency components efficiently. We introduce Sinusoidal Trainable Activation Functions (STAF), designed to directly tackle this limitation by enabling networks to adaptively learn and represent complex signals with higher precision and efficiency. STAF inherently modulates its frequency components, allowing for self-adaptive spectral learning. This capability significantly improves convergence speed and expressivity, making STAF highly effective for both signal representations and inverse problems. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that STAF outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in accuracy and reconstruction fidelity with superior Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). These results establish STAF as a robust solution for overcoming spectral bias and the capacity-convergence gap, making it valuable for computer graphics and related fields.

      <title>LoR-VP: Low-Rank Visual Prompting for Efficient Vision Model Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00896v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual prompting has gained popularity as a method for adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks, particularly in the realm of parameter-efficient tuning. However, existing visual prompting techniques often pad the prompt parameters around the image, limiting the interaction between the visual prompts and the original image to a small set of patches while neglecting the inductive bias present in shared information across different patches. In this study, we conduct a thorough preliminary investigation to identify and address these limitations. We propose a novel visual prompt design, introducing Low-Rank matrix multiplication for Visual Prompting (LoR-VP), which enables shared and patch-specific information across rows and columns of image pixels. Extensive experiments across seven network architectures and four datasets demonstrate significant improvements in both performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art visual prompting methods, achieving up to 6 times faster training times, utilizing 18 times fewer visual prompt parameters, and delivering a 3.1% improvement in performance. The code is available as https://github.com/jincan333/LoR-VP.</description>

      <title>Fruit Fly Classification (Diptera: Tephritidae) in Images, Applying Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops a transfer learning model for the automated classification of two species of fruit flies, Anastrepha fraterculus and Ceratitis capitata, in a controlled laboratory environment. The research addresses the need to optimize identification and classification, which are currently performed manually by experts, being affected by human factors and facing time challenges. The methodological process of this study includes the capture of high-quality images using a mobile phone camera and a stereo microscope, followed by segmentation to reduce size and focus on relevant morphological areas. The images were carefully labeled and preprocessed to ensure the quality and consistency of the dataset used to train the pre-trained convolutional neural network models VGG16, VGG19, and Inception-v3. The results were evaluated using the F1-score, achieving 82% for VGG16 and VGG19, while Inception-v3 reached an F1-score of 93%. Inception-v3's reliability was verified through model testing in uncontrolled environments, with positive results, complemented by the Grad-CAM technique, demonstrating its ability to capture essential morphological features. These findings indicate that Inception-v3 is an effective and replicable approach for classifying Anastrepha fraterculus and Ceratitis capitata, with potential for implementation in automated monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>Hypo3D: Exploring Hypothetical Reasoning in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00954v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of vision-language foundation models marks an advancement in bridging the gap between human and machine capabilities in 3D scene reasoning. Existing 3D reasoning benchmarks assume real-time scene accessibility, which is impractical due to the high cost of frequent scene updates. To this end, we introduce Hypothetical 3D Reasoning, namely Hypo3D, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' ability to reason without access to real-time scene data. Models need to imagine the scene state based on a provided change description before reasoning. Hypo3D is formulated as a 3D Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark, comprising 7,727 context changes across 700 indoor scenes, resulting in 14,885 question-answer pairs. An anchor-based world frame is established for all scenes, ensuring consistent reference to a global frame for directional terms in context changes and QAs. Extensive experiments show that state-of-the-art foundation models struggle to reason in hypothetically changed scenes. This reveals a substantial performance gap compared to humans, particularly in scenarios involving movement changes and directional reasoning. Even when the context change is irrelevant to the question, models often incorrectly adjust their answers.</description>

      <title>SAM-guided Pseudo Label Enhancement for Multi-modal 3D Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal 3D semantic segmentation is vital for applications such as autonomous driving and virtual reality (VR). To effectively deploy these models in real-world scenarios, it is essential to employ cross-domain adaptation techniques that bridge the gap between training data and real-world data. Recently, self-training with pseudo-labels has emerged as a predominant method for cross-domain adaptation in multi-modal 3D semantic segmentation. However, generating reliable pseudo-labels necessitates stringent constraints, which often result in sparse pseudo-labels after pruning. This sparsity can potentially hinder performance improvement during the adaptation process. We propose an image-guided pseudo-label enhancement approach that leverages the complementary 2D prior knowledge from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to introduce more reliable pseudo-labels, thereby boosting domain adaptation performance. Specifically, given a 3D point cloud and the SAM masks from its paired image data, we collect all 3D points covered by each SAM mask that potentially belong to the same object. Then our method refines the pseudo-labels within each SAM mask in two steps. First, we determine the class label for each mask using majority voting and employ various constraints to filter out unreliable mask labels. Next, we introduce Geometry-Aware Progressive Propagation (GAPP) which propagates the mask label to all 3D points within the SAM mask while avoiding outliers caused by 2D-3D misalignment. Experiments conducted across multiple datasets and domain adaptation scenarios demonstrate that our proposed method significantly increases the quantity of high-quality pseudo-labels and enhances the adaptation performance over baseline methods.</description>

      <title>CLIP-UP: A Simple and Efficient Mixture-of-Experts CLIP Training Recipe with Sparse Upcycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are crucial for scaling model capacity while controlling inference costs. While integrating MoE into multimodal models like CLIP improves performance, training these models is notoriously challenging and expensive. We propose CLIP-Upcycling (CLIP-UP), an efficient alternative training strategy that converts a pre-trained dense CLIP model into a sparse MoE architecture. Through extensive experimentation with various settings and auxiliary losses, we demonstrate that CLIP-UP significantly reduces training complexity and cost. Remarkably, our sparse CLIP B/16 model, trained with CLIP-UP, outperforms its dense counterpart by 7.2% and 6.6% on COCO and Flickr30k text-to-image Recall@1 benchmarks respectively. It even surpasses the larger CLIP L/14 model on this task while using only 30% of the inference FLOPs. We further demonstrate the generalizability of our training recipe across different scales, establishing sparse upcycling as a practical and scalable approach for building efficient, high-performance CLIP models.</description>

      <title>CoDe: Blockwise Control for Denoising Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning diffusion models to downstream tasks often requires finetuning new models or gradient-based guidance at inference time to enable sampling from the reward-tilted posterior. In this work, we explore a simple inference-time gradient-free guidance approach, called controlled denoising (CoDe), that circumvents the need for differentiable guidance functions and model finetuning. CoDe is a blockwise sampling method applied during intermediate denoising steps, allowing for alignment with downstream rewards. Our experiments demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, CoDe offers a favorable trade-off between reward alignment, prompt instruction following, and inference cost, achieving a competitive performance against the state-of-the-art baselines.

      <title>Pushing the Boundaries of State Space Models for Image and Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Transformers have become the dominant architecture for visual generation, linear attention models, such as the state-space models (SSM), are increasingly recognized for their efficiency in processing long visual sequences. However, the essential efficiency of these models comes from formulating a limited recurrent state, enforcing causality among tokens that are prone to inconsistent modeling of N-dimensional visual data, leaving questions on their capacity to generate long non-causal sequences. In this paper, we explore the boundary of SSM on image and video generation by building the largest-scale diffusion SSM-Transformer hybrid model to date (5B parameters) based on the sub-quadratic bi-directional Hydra and self-attention, and generate up to 2K images and 360p 8 seconds (16 FPS) videos. Our results demonstrate that the model can produce faithful results aligned with complex text prompts and temporal consistent videos with high dynamics, suggesting the great potential of using SSMs for visual generation tasks.</description>

      <title>FCBoost-Net: A Generative Network for Synthesizing Multiple Collocated Outfits via Fashion Compatibility Boosting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outfit generation is a challenging task in the field of fashion technology, in which the aim is to create a collocated set of fashion items that complement a given set of items. Previous studies in this area have been limited to generating a unique set of fashion items based on a given set of items, without providing additional options to users. This lack of a diverse range of choices necessitates the development of a more versatile framework. However, when the task of generating collocated and diversified outfits is approached with multimodal image-to-image translation methods, it poses a challenging problem in terms of non-aligned image translation, which is hard to address with existing methods. In this research, we present FCBoost-Net, a new framework for outfit generation that leverages the power of pre-trained generative models to produce multiple collocated and diversified outfits. Initially, FCBoost-Net randomly synthesizes multiple sets of fashion items, and the compatibility of the synthesized sets is then improved in several rounds using a novel fashion compatibility booster. This approach was inspired by boosting algorithms and allows the performance to be gradually improved in multiple steps. Empirical evidence indicates that the proposed strategy can improve the fashion compatibility of randomly synthesized fashion items as well as maintain their diversity. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposed framework with respect to visual authenticity, diversity, and fashion compatibility.</description>

      <title>Adapting Foundation Models for Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation: Actively and Sequentially</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have brought promising results in computer vision, including medical image segmentation. Fine-tuning foundation models on specific low-resource medical tasks has become a standard practice. However, ensuring reliable and robust model adaptation when the target task has a large domain gap and few annotated samples remains a challenge. Previous few-shot domain adaptation (FSDA) methods seek to bridge the distribution gap between source and target domains by utilizing auxiliary data. The selection and scheduling of auxiliaries are often based on heuristics, which can easily cause negative transfer. In this work, we propose an Active and Sequential domain AdaPtation (ASAP) framework for dynamic auxiliary dataset selection in FSDA. We formulate FSDA as a multi-armed bandit problem and derive an efficient reward function to prioritize training on auxiliary datasets that align closely with the target task, through a single-round fine-tuning. Empirical validation on diverse medical segmentation datasets demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art FSDA methods, achieving an average gain of 27.75% on MRI and 7.52% on CT datasets in Dice score.

      <title>Multi-Resolution SAR and Optical Remote Sensing Image Registration Methods: A Review, Datasets, and Future Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical image registration is essential for remote sensing data fusion, with applications in military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. However, challenges arise from differences in imaging mechanisms, geometric distortions, and radiometric properties between SAR and optical images. As image resolution increases, fine SAR textures become more significant, leading to alignment issues and 3D spatial discrepancies. Two major gaps exist: the lack of a publicly available multi-resolution, multi-scene registration dataset and the absence of systematic analysis of current methods. To address this, the MultiResSAR dataset was created, containing over 10k pairs of multi-source, multi-resolution, and multi-scene SAR and optical images. Sixteen state-of-the-art algorithms were tested. Results show no algorithm achieves 100% success, and performance decreases as resolution increases, with most failing on sub-meter data. XoFTR performs best among deep learning methods (40.58%), while RIFT performs best among traditional methods (66.51%). Future research should focus on noise suppression, 3D geometric fusion, cross-view transformation modeling, and deep learning optimization for robust registration of high-resolution SAR and optical images. The dataset is available at https://github.com/betterlll/Multi-Resolution-SAR-dataset-.</description>

      <title>ZeroBP: Learning Position-Aware Correspondence for Zero-shot 6D Pose Estimation in Bin-Picking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bin-picking is a practical and challenging robotic manipulation task, where accurate 6D pose estimation plays a pivotal role. The workpieces in bin-picking are typically textureless and randomly stacked in a bin, which poses a significant challenge to 6D pose estimation. Existing solutions are typically learning-based methods, which require object-specific training. Their efficiency of practical deployment for novel workpieces is highly limited by data collection and model retraining. Zero-shot 6D pose estimation is a potential approach to address the issue of deployment efficiency. Nevertheless, existing zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods are designed to leverage feature matching to establish point-to-point correspondences for pose estimation, which is less effective for workpieces with textureless appearances and ambiguous local regions. In this paper, we propose ZeroBP, a zero-shot pose estimation framework designed specifically for the bin-picking task. ZeroBP learns Position-Aware Correspondence (PAC) between the scene instance and its CAD model, leveraging both local features and global positions to resolve the mismatch issue caused by ambiguous regions with similar shapes and appearances. Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that ZeroBP outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot pose estimation methods, achieving an improvement of 9.1% in average recall of correct poses.</description>

      <title>Vessel segmentation for X-separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\chi$-separation is an advanced quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) method that is designed to generate paramagnetic ($\chi_{para}$) and diamagnetic ($|\chi_{dia}|$) susceptibility maps, reflecting the distribution of iron and myelin in the brain. However, vessels have shown artifacts, interfering with the accurate quantification of iron and myelin in applications. To address this challenge, a new vessel segmentation method for $\chi$-separation is developed. The method comprises three steps: 1) Seed generation from $\textit{R}_2^*$ and the product of $\chi_{para}$ and $|\chi_{dia}|$ maps; 2) Region growing, guided by vessel geometry, creating a vessel mask; 3) Refinement of the vessel mask by excluding non-vessel structures. The performance of the method was compared to conventional vessel segmentation methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. To demonstrate the utility of the method, it was tested in two applications: quantitative evaluation of a neural network-based $\chi$-separation reconstruction method ($\chi$-sepnet-$\textit{R}_2^*$) and population-averaged region of interest (ROI) analysis. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance to the conventional vessel segmentation methods, effectively excluding the non-vessel structures, achieving the highest Dice score coefficient. For the applications, applying vessel masks report notable improvements for the quantitative evaluation of $\chi$-sepnet-$\textit{R}_2^*$ and statistically significant differences in population-averaged ROI analysis. These applications suggest excluding vessels when analyzing the $\chi$-separation maps provide more accurate evaluations. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate various applications, offering reliable analysis through the generation of a high-quality vessel mask.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present WonderHuman to reconstruct dynamic human avatars from a monocular video for high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Previous dynamic human avatar reconstruction methods typically require the input video to have full coverage of the observed human body. However, in daily practice, one typically has access to limited viewpoints, such as monocular front-view videos, making it a cumbersome task for previous methods to reconstruct the unseen parts of the human avatar. To tackle the issue, we present WonderHuman, which leverages 2D generative diffusion model priors to achieve high-quality, photorealistic reconstructions of dynamic human avatars from monocular videos, including accurate rendering of unseen body parts. Our approach introduces a Dual-Space Optimization technique, applying Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) in both canonical and observation spaces to ensure visual consistency and enhance realism in dynamic human reconstruction. Additionally, we present a View Selection strategy and Pose Feature Injection to enforce the consistency between SDS predictions and observed data, ensuring pose-dependent effects and higher fidelity in the reconstructed avatar. In the experiments, our method achieves SOTA performance in producing photorealistic renderings from the given monocular video, particularly for those challenging unseen parts.

      <title>Sparks of Explainability: Recent Advancements in Explaining Large Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis explores advanced approaches to improve explainability in computer vision by analyzing and modeling the features exploited by deep neural networks. Initially, it evaluates attribution methods, notably saliency maps, by introducing a metric based on algorithmic stability and an approach utilizing Sobol indices, which, through quasi-Monte Carlo sequences, allows a significant reduction in computation time. In addition, the EVA method offers a first formulation of attribution with formal guarantees via verified perturbation analysis.
  Experimental results indicate that in complex scenarios these methods do not provide sufficient understanding, particularly because they identify only "where" the model focuses without clarifying "what" it perceives. Two hypotheses are therefore examined: aligning models with human reasoning -- through the introduction of a training routine that integrates the imitation of human explanations and optimization within the space of 1-Lipschitz functions -- and adopting a conceptual explainability approach.
  The CRAFT method is proposed to automate the extraction of the concepts used by the model and to assess their importance, complemented by MACO, which enables their visualization. These works converge towards a unified framework, illustrated by an interactive demonstration applied to the 1000 ImageNet classes in a ResNet model.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model as a Noise-Aware Latent Reward Model for Step-Level Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preference optimization for diffusion models aims to align them with human preferences for images. Previous methods typically leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as pixel-level reward models to approximate human preferences. However, when used for step-level preference optimization, these models face challenges in handling noisy images of different timesteps and require complex transformations into pixel space. In this work, we demonstrate that diffusion models are inherently well-suited for step-level reward modeling in the latent space, as they can naturally extract features from noisy latent images. Accordingly, we propose the Latent Reward Model (LRM), which repurposes components of diffusion models to predict preferences of latent images at various timesteps. Building on LRM, we introduce Latent Preference Optimization (LPO), a method designed for step-level preference optimization directly in the latent space. Experimental results indicate that LPO not only significantly enhances performance in aligning diffusion models with general, aesthetic, and text-image alignment preferences, but also achieves 2.5-28$\times$ training speedup compared to existing preference optimization methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/casiatao/LPO.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models with Internal Fact-based Contrastive Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) integrate visual and linguistic modalities, exhibiting exceptional performance across various multimodal tasks. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain vulnerable to the issue of object hallucinations. Previous efforts to mitigate this issue focus on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or incorporating external knowledge, both of which entail significant costs related to training and the acquisition of external data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model-agnostic approach termed Internal Fact-based Contrastive Decoding (IFCD), designed to mitigate and suppress hallucinations during the inference process of LVLMs by exploiting the LVLMs' own hallucinations. IFCD is grounded in experimental observations that alterations to the LVLMs' internal representations tend to amplify hallucinations caused by language bias. By contrasting disturbed distribution, IFCD calibrates the LVLMs' output and effectively removes the hallucinatory logits from the final predictions. Experimental results validate that IFCD significantly alleviates both object-level and attribute-level hallucinations while achieving an average 9% accuracy improvement on POPE and 8% accuracy improvement on MME object hallucinations subset compared with direct decoding, respectively.</description>

      <title>OmniHuman-1: Rethinking the Scaling-Up of One-Stage Conditioned Human Animation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end human animation, such as audio-driven talking human generation, has undergone notable advancements in the recent few years. However, existing methods still struggle to scale up as large general video generation models, limiting their potential in real applications. In this paper, we propose OmniHuman, a Diffusion Transformer-based framework that scales up data by mixing motion-related conditions into the training phase. To this end, we introduce two training principles for these mixed conditions, along with the corresponding model architecture and inference strategy. These designs enable OmniHuman to fully leverage data-driven motion generation, ultimately achieving highly realistic human video generation. More importantly, OmniHuman supports various portrait contents (face close-up, portrait, half-body, full-body), supports both talking and singing, handles human-object interactions and challenging body poses, and accommodates different image styles. Compared to existing end-to-end audio-driven methods, OmniHuman not only produces more realistic videos, but also offers greater flexibility in inputs. It also supports multiple driving modalities (audio-driven, video-driven and combined driving signals). Video samples are provided on the ttfamily project page (https://omnihuman-lab.github.io)</description>

      <title>BC-GAN: A Generative Adversarial Network for Synthesizing a Batch of Collocated Clothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collocated clothing synthesis using generative networks has become an emerging topic in the field of fashion intelligence, as it has significant potential economic value to increase revenue in the fashion industry. In previous studies, several works have attempted to synthesize visually-collocated clothing based on a given clothing item using generative adversarial networks (GANs) with promising results. These works, however, can only accomplish the synthesis of one collocated clothing item each time. Nevertheless, users may require different clothing items to meet their multiple choices due to their personal tastes and different dressing scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel batch clothing generation framework, named BC-GAN, which is able to synthesize multiple visually-collocated clothing images simultaneously. In particular, to further improve the fashion compatibility of synthetic results, BC-GAN proposes a new fashion compatibility discriminator in a contrastive learning perspective by fully exploiting the collocation relationship among all clothing items. Our model was examined in a large-scale dataset with compatible outfits constructed by ourselves. Extensive experiment results confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed BC-GAN in comparison to state-of-the-art methods in terms of diversity, visual authenticity, and fashion compatibility.</description>

      <title>The Jumping Reasoning Curve? Tracking the Evolution of Reasoning Performance in GPT-[n] and o-[n] Models on Multimodal Puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The releases of OpenAI's o1 and o3 mark a significant paradigm shift in Large Language Models towards advanced reasoning capabilities. Notably, o3 outperformed humans in novel problem-solving and skill acquisition on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI). However, this benchmark is limited to symbolic patterns, whereas humans often perceive and reason about multimodal scenarios involving both vision and language data. Thus, there is an urgent need to investigate advanced reasoning capabilities in multimodal tasks. To this end, we track the evolution of the GPT-[n] and o-[n] series models on challenging multimodal puzzles, requiring fine-grained visual perception with abstract or algorithmic reasoning. The superior performance of o1 comes at nearly 750 times the computational cost of GPT-4o, raising concerns about its efficiency. Our results reveal a clear upward trend in reasoning capabilities across model iterations, with notable performance jumps across GPT-series models and subsequently to o1. Nonetheless, we observe that the o1 model still struggles with simple multimodal puzzles requiring abstract reasoning. Furthermore, its performance in algorithmic puzzles remains poor. We plan to continuously track new models in the series and update our results in this paper accordingly. All resources used in this evaluation are openly available https://github.com/declare-lab/LLM-PuzzleTest.</description>

      <title>SatFlow: Generative model based framework for producing High Resolution Gap Free Remote Sensing Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequent, high-resolution remote sensing imagery is crucial for agricultural and environmental monitoring. Satellites from the Landsat collection offer detailed imagery at 30m resolution but with lower temporal frequency, whereas missions like MODIS and VIIRS provide daily coverage at coarser resolutions. Clouds and cloud shadows contaminate about 55\% of the optical remote sensing observations, posing additional challenges. To address these challenges, we present SatFlow, a generative model-based framework that fuses low-resolution MODIS imagery and Landsat observations to produce frequent, high-resolution, gap-free surface reflectance imagery. Our model, trained via Conditional Flow Matching, demonstrates better performance in generating imagery with preserved structural and spectral integrity. Cloud imputation is treated as an image inpainting task, where the model reconstructs cloud-contaminated pixels and fills gaps caused by scan lines during inference by leveraging the learned generative processes. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of our approach in reliably imputing cloud-covered regions. This capability is crucial for downstream applications such as crop phenology tracking, environmental change detection etc.,</description>

      <title>VidSketch: Hand-drawn Sketch-Driven Video Generation with Diffusion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of generative artificial intelligence, previous studies have achieved the task of generating aesthetic images from hand-drawn sketches, fulfilling the public's needs for drawing. However, these methods are limited to static images and lack the ability to control video animation generation using hand-drawn sketches. To address this gap, we propose VidSketch, the first method capable of generating high-quality video animations directly from any number of hand-drawn sketches and simple text prompts, bridging the divide between ordinary users and professional artists. Specifically, our method introduces a Level-Based Sketch Control Strategy to automatically adjust the guidance strength of sketches during the generation process, accommodating users with varying drawing skills. Furthermore, a TempSpatial Attention mechanism is designed to enhance the spatiotemporal consistency of generated video animations, significantly improving the coherence across frames. You can find more detailed cases on our official website.</description>

      <title>LayerTracer: Cognitive-Aligned Layered SVG Synthesis via Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating cognitive-aligned layered SVGs remains challenging due to existing methods' tendencies toward either oversimplified single-layer outputs or optimization-induced shape redundancies. We propose LayerTracer, a diffusion transformer based framework that bridges this gap by learning designers' layered SVG creation processes from a novel dataset of sequential design operations. Our approach operates in two phases: First, a text-conditioned DiT generates multi-phase rasterized construction blueprints that simulate human design workflows. Second, layer-wise vectorization with path deduplication produces clean, editable SVGs. For image vectorization, we introduce a conditional diffusion mechanism that encodes reference images into latent tokens, guiding hierarchical reconstruction while preserving structural integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate LayerTracer's superior performance against optimization-based and neural baselines in both generation quality and editability, effectively aligning AI-generated vectors with professional design cognition.</description>

      <title>Radiant Foam: Real-Time Differentiable Ray Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on differentiable scene representations is consistently moving towards more efficient, real-time models. Recently, this has led to the popularization of splatting methods, which eschew the traditional ray-based rendering of radiance fields in favor of rasterization. This has yielded a significant improvement in rendering speeds due to the efficiency of rasterization algorithms and hardware, but has come at a cost: the approximations that make rasterization efficient also make implementation of light transport phenomena like reflection and refraction much more difficult. We propose a novel scene representation which avoids these approximations, but keeps the efficiency and reconstruction quality of splatting by leveraging a decades-old efficient volumetric mesh ray tracing algorithm which has been largely overlooked in recent computer vision research. The resulting model, which we name Radiant Foam, achieves rendering speed and quality comparable to Gaussian Splatting, without the constraints of rasterization. Unlike ray traced Gaussian models that use hardware ray tracing acceleration, our method requires no special hardware or APIs beyond the standard features of a programmable GPU.</description>

      <title>BVINet: Unlocking Blind Video Inpainting with Zero Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video inpainting aims to fill in corrupted regions of the video with plausible contents. Existing methods generally assume that the locations of corrupted regions are known, focusing primarily on the "how to inpaint". This reliance necessitates manual annotation of the corrupted regions using binary masks to indicate "whereto inpaint". However, the annotation of these masks is labor-intensive and expensive, limiting the practicality of current methods. In this paper, we expect to relax this assumption by defining a new blind video inpainting setting, enabling the networks to learn the mapping from corrupted video to inpainted result directly, eliminating the need of corrupted region annotations. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end blind video inpainting network (BVINet) to address both "where to inpaint" and "how to inpaint" simultaneously. On the one hand, BVINet can predict the masks of corrupted regions by detecting semantic-discontinuous regions of the frame and utilizing temporal consistency prior of the video. On the other hand, the predicted masks are incorporated into the BVINet, allowing it to capture valid context information from uncorrupted regions to fill in corrupted ones. Besides, we introduce a consistency loss to regularize the training parameters of BVINet. In this way, mask prediction and video completion mutually constrain each other, thereby maximizing the overall performance of the trained model. Furthermore, we customize a dataset consisting of synthetic corrupted videos, real-world corrupted videos, and their corresponding completed videos. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing blind video inpainting research. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Environmental Robustness in Few-shot Learning via Conditional Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) has recently been extensively utilized to overcome the scarcity of training data in domain-specific visual recognition. In real-world scenarios, environmental factors such as complex backgrounds, varying lighting conditions, long-distance shooting, and moving targets often cause test images to exhibit numerous incomplete targets or noise disruptions. However, current research on evaluation datasets and methodologies has largely ignored the concept of "environmental robustness", which refers to maintaining consistent performance in complex and diverse physical environments. This neglect has led to a notable decline in the performance of FSL models during practical testing compared to their training performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new real-world multi-domain few-shot learning (RD-FSL) benchmark, which includes four domains and six evaluation datasets. The test images in this benchmark feature various challenging elements, such as camouflaged objects, small targets, and blurriness. Our evaluation experiments reveal that existing methods struggle to utilize training images effectively to generate accurate feature representations for challenging test images. To address this problem, we propose a novel conditional representation learning network (CRLNet) that integrates the interactions between training and testing images as conditional information in their respective representation processes. The main goal is to reduce intra-class variance or enhance inter-class variance at the feature representation level. Finally, comparative experiments reveal that CRLNet surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods, achieving performance improvements ranging from 6.83% to 16.98% across diverse settings and backbones. The source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/guoqianyu-alberta/Conditional-Representation-Learning.</description>

      <title>A High-Accuracy SSIM-based Scoring System for Coin Die Link Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analyses of ancient coins, and especially the identification of those struck with the same die, provides invaluable information for archaeologists and historians. Nowadays, these die links are identified manually, which makes the process laborious, if not impossible when big treasures are discovered as the number of comparisons is too large. This study introduces advances that promise to streamline and enhance archaeological coin analysis. Our contributions include: 1) First publicly accessible labeled dataset of coin pictures (329 images) for die link detection, facilitating method benchmarking; 2) Novel SSIM-based scoring method for rapid and accurate discrimination of coin pairs, outperforming current techniques used in this research field; 3) Evaluation of clustering techniques using our score, demonstrating near-perfect die link identification. We provide datasets, to foster future research and the development of even more powerful tools for archaeology, and more particularly for numismatics.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust and Reliable Concept Representations: Reliability-Enhanced Concept Embedding Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to enhance interpretability by predicting human-understandable concepts as intermediates for decision-making. However, these models often face challenges in ensuring reliable concept representations, which can propagate to downstream tasks and undermine robustness, especially under distribution shifts. Two inherent issues contribute to concept unreliability: sensitivity to concept-irrelevant features (e.g., background variations) and lack of semantic consistency for the same concept across different samples. To address these limitations, we propose the Reliability-Enhanced Concept Embedding Model (RECEM), which introduces a two-fold strategy: Concept-Level Disentanglement to separate irrelevant features from concept-relevant information and a Concept Mixup mechanism to ensure semantic alignment across samples. These mechanisms work together to improve concept reliability, enabling the model to focus on meaningful object attributes and generate faithful concept representations.

      <title>Nearly Lossless Adaptive Bit Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model quantization is widely applied for compressing and accelerating deep neural networks (DNNs). However, conventional Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) focuses on training DNNs with uniform bit-width. The bit-width settings vary across different hardware and transmission demands, which induces considerable training and storage costs. Hence, the scheme of one-shot joint training multiple precisions is proposed to address this issue. Previous works either store a larger FP32 model to switch between different precision models for higher accuracy or store a smaller INT8 model but compromise accuracy due to using shared quantization parameters. In this paper, we introduce the Double Rounding quantization method, which fully utilizes the quantized representation range to accomplish nearly lossless bit-switching while reducing storage by using the highest integer precision instead of full precision. Furthermore, we observe a competitive interference among different precisions during one-shot joint training, primarily due to inconsistent gradients of quantization scales during backward propagation. To tackle this problem, we propose an Adaptive Learning Rate Scaling (ALRS) technique that dynamically adapts learning rates for various precisions to optimize the training process. Additionally, we extend our Double Rounding to one-shot mixed precision training and develop a Hessian-Aware Stochastic Bit-switching (HASB) strategy. Experimental results on the ImageNet-1K classification demonstrate that our methods have enough advantages to state-of-the-art one-shot joint QAT in both multi-precision and mixed-precision. We also validate the feasibility of our method on detection and segmentation tasks, as well as on LLMs task. Our codes are available at https://github.com/haiduo/Double-Rounding.</description>

      <title>One-to-Normal: Anomaly Personalization for Few-shot Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional Anomaly Detection (AD) methods have predominantly relied on unsupervised learning from extensive normal data. Recent AD methods have evolved with the advent of large pre-trained vision-language models, enhancing few-shot anomaly detection capabilities. However, these latest AD methods still exhibit limitations in accuracy improvement. One contributing factor is their direct comparison of a query image's features with those of few-shot normal images. This direct comparison often leads to a loss of precision and complicates the extension of these techniques to more complex domains--an area that remains underexplored in a more refined and comprehensive manner. To address these limitations, we introduce the anomaly personalization method, which performs a personalized one-to-normal transformation of query images using an anomaly-free customized generation model, ensuring close alignment with the normal manifold. Moreover, to further enhance the stability and robustness of prediction results, we propose a triplet contrastive anomaly inference strategy, which incorporates a comprehensive comparison between the query and generated anomaly-free data pool and prompt information. Extensive evaluations across eleven datasets in three domains demonstrate our model's effectiveness compared to the latest AD methods. Additionally, our method has been proven to transfer flexibly to other AD methods, with the generated image data effectively improving the performance of other AD methods.</description>

      <title>Exploring Few-Shot Defect Segmentation in General Industrial Scenarios with Metric Learning and Vision Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial defect segmentation is critical for manufacturing quality control. Due to the scarcity of training defect samples, few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) holds significant value in this field. However, existing studies mostly apply FSS to tackle defects on simple textures, without considering more diverse scenarios. This paper aims to address this gap by exploring FSS in broader industrial products with various defect types. To this end, we contribute a new real-world dataset and reorganize some existing datasets to build a more comprehensive few-shot defect segmentation (FDS) benchmark. On this benchmark, we thoroughly investigate metric learning-based FSS methods, including those based on meta-learning and those based on Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). We observe that existing meta-learning-based methods are generally not well-suited for this task, while VFMs hold great potential. We further systematically study the applicability of various VFMs in this task, involving two paradigms: feature matching and the use of Segment Anything (SAM) models. We propose a novel efficient FDS method based on feature matching. Meanwhile, we find that SAM2 is particularly effective for addressing FDS through its video track mode. The contributed dataset and code will be available at: https://github.com/liutongkun/GFDS.</description>

      <title>FSPGD: Rethinking Black-box Attacks on Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transferability, the ability of adversarial examples crafted for one model to deceive other models, is crucial for black-box attacks. Despite advancements in attack methods for semantic segmentation, transferability remains limited, reducing their effectiveness in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce the Feature Similarity Projected Gradient Descent (FSPGD) attack, a novel black-box approach that enhances both attack performance and transferability. Unlike conventional segmentation attacks that rely on output predictions for gradient calculation, FSPGD computes gradients from intermediate layer features. Specifically, our method introduces a loss function that targets local information by comparing features between clean images and adversarial examples, while also disrupting contextual information by accounting for spatial relationships between objects. Experiments on Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that FSPGD achieves superior transferability and attack performance, establishing a new state-of-the-art benchmark. Code is available at https://github.com/KU-AIVS/FSPGD.</description>

      <title>Label Correction for Road Segmentation Using Road-side Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable road segmentation in all weather conditions is critical for intelligent transportation applications, autonomous vehicles and advanced driver's assistance systems. For robust performance, all weather conditions should be included in the training data of deep learning-based perception models. However, collecting and annotating such a dataset requires extensive resources. In this paper, existing roadside camera infrastructure is utilized for collecting road data in varying weather conditions automatically. Additionally, a novel semi-automatic annotation method for roadside cameras is proposed. For each camera, only one frame is labeled manually and then the label is transferred to other frames of that camera feed. The small camera movements between frames are compensated using frequency domain image registration. The proposed method is validated with roadside camera data collected from 927 cameras across Finland over 4 month time period during winter. Training on the semi-automatically labeled data boosted the segmentation performance of several deep learning segmentation models. Testing was carried out on two different datasets to evaluate the robustness of the resulting models. These datasets were an in-domain roadside camera dataset and out-of-domain dataset captured with a vehicle on-board camera.</description>

      <title>Template Matching in Images using Segmented Normalized Cross-Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a new variant of an algorithm for normalized cross-correlation (NCC) is proposed in the context of template matching in images. The proposed algorithm is based on the precomputation of a template image approximation, enabling more efficient calculation of approximate NCC with the source image than using the original template for exact NCC calculation. The approximate template is precomputed from the template image by a split-and-merge approach, resulting in a decomposition to axis-aligned rectangular segments, whose sizes depend on per-segment pixel intensity variance. In the approximate template, each segment is assigned the mean grayscale value of the corresponding pixels from the original template. The proposed algorithm achieves superior computational performance with negligible NCC approximation errors compared to the well-known Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based NCC algorithm, when applied on less visually complex and/or smaller template images. In other cases, the proposed algorithm can maintain either computational performance or NCC approximation error within the range of the FFT-based algorithm, but not both.</description>

      <title>XR-VIO: High-precision Visual Inertial Odometry with Fast Initialization for XR Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO), focusing on the initialization and feature matching modules. Existing methods for initialization often suffer from either poor stability in visual Structure from Motion (SfM) or fragility in solving a huge number of parameters simultaneously. To address these challenges, we propose a new pipeline for visual inertial initialization that robustly handles various complex scenarios. By tightly coupling gyroscope measurements, we enhance the robustness and accuracy of visual SfM. Our method demonstrates stable performance even with only four image frames, yielding competitive results. In terms of feature matching, we introduce a hybrid method that combines optical flow and descriptor-based matching. By leveraging the robustness of continuous optical flow tracking and the accuracy of descriptor matching, our approach achieves efficient, accurate, and robust tracking results. Through evaluation on multiple benchmarks, our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and success rate. Additionally, a video demonstration on mobile devices showcases the practical applicability of our approach in the field of Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR).</description>

      <title>Partial Channel Network: Compute Fewer, Perform Better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing a module or mechanism that enables a network to maintain low parameters and FLOPs without sacrificing accuracy and throughput remains a challenge. To address this challenge and exploit the redundancy within feature map channels, we propose a new solution: partial channel mechanism (PCM). Specifically, through the split operation, the feature map channels are divided into different parts, with each part corresponding to different operations, such as convolution, attention, pooling, and identity mapping. Based on this assumption, we introduce a novel partial attention convolution (PATConv) that can efficiently combine convolution with visual attention. Our exploration indicates that the PATConv can completely replace both the regular convolution and the regular visual attention while reducing model parameters and FLOPs. Moreover, PATConv can derive three new types of blocks: Partial Channel-Attention block (PAT_ch), Partial Spatial-Attention block (PAT_sp), and Partial Self-Attention block (PAT_sf). In addition, we propose a novel dynamic partial convolution (DPConv) that can adaptively learn the proportion of split channels in different layers to achieve better trade-offs. Building on PATConv and DPConv, we propose a new hybrid network family, named PartialNet, which achieves superior top-1 accuracy and inference speed compared to some SOTA models on ImageNet-1K classification and excels in both detection and segmentation on the COCO dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/haiduo/PartialNet.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Image GNN: Graph-Conditioned Diffusion for Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for conditioning diffusion-based image synthesis models with heterogeneous graph data. Existing approaches typically incorporate conditioning variables directly into model architectures, either through cross-attention layers that attend to text latents or image concatenation that spatially restrict generation. However, these methods struggle to handle complex scenarios involving diverse, relational conditioning variables, which are more naturally represented as unstructured graphs. This paper presents Heterogeneous Image Graphs (HIG), a novel representation that models conditioning variables and target images as two interconnected graphs, enabling efficient handling of variable-length conditioning inputs and their relationships. We also propose a magnitude-preserving GNN that integrates the HIG into the existing EDM2 diffusion model using a ControlNet approach. Our approach improves upon the SOTA on a variety of conditioning inputs for the COCO-stuff and Visual Genome datasets, and showcases the ability to condition on graph attributes and relationships represented by edges in the HIG.</description>

      <title>CleanPose: Category-Level Object Pose Estimation via Causal Learning and Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation aims to recover the rotation, translation and size of unseen instances within predefined categories. In this task, deep neural network-based methods have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, previous studies show they suffer from spurious correlations raised by "unclean" confounders in models, hindering their performance on novel instances with significant variations. To address this issue, we propose CleanPose, a novel approach integrating causal learning and knowledge distillation to enhance category-level pose estimation. To mitigate the negative effect of unobserved confounders, we develop a causal inference module based on front-door adjustment, which promotes unbiased estimation by reducing potential spurious correlations. Additionally, to further improve generalization ability, we devise a residual-based knowledge distillation method that has proven effective in providing comprehensive category information guidance. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks (REAL275, CAMERA25 and HouseCat6D) hightlight the superiority of proposed CleanPose over state-of-the-art methods. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>ConceptVAE: Self-Supervised Fine-Grained Concept Disentanglement from 2D Echocardiographies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While traditional self-supervised learning methods improve performance and robustness across various medical tasks, they rely on single-vector embeddings that may not capture fine-grained concepts such as anatomical structures or organs. The ability to identify such concepts and their characteristics without supervision has the potential to improve pre-training methods, and enable novel applications such as fine-grained image retrieval and concept-based outlier detection. In this paper, we introduce ConceptVAE, a novel pre-training framework that detects and disentangles fine-grained concepts from their style characteristics in a self-supervised manner. We present a suite of loss terms and model architecture primitives designed to discretise input data into a preset number of concepts along with their local style. We validate ConceptVAE both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating its ability to detect fine-grained anatomical structures such as blood pools and septum walls from 2D cardiac echocardiographies. Quantitatively, ConceptVAE outperforms traditional self-supervised methods in tasks such as region-based instance retrieval, semantic segmentation, out-of-distribution detection, and object detection. Additionally, we explore the generation of in-distribution synthetic data that maintains the same concepts as the training data but with distinct styles, highlighting its potential for more calibrated data generation. Overall, our study introduces and validates a promising new pre-training technique based on concept-style disentanglement, opening multiple avenues for developing models for medical image analysis that are more interpretable and explainable than black-box approaches.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Conformal Convolution : A Learnable Convolution for Deep Learning on Riemann Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01356v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning on non-Euclidean domains is important for analyzing complex geometric data that lacks common coordinate systems and familiar Euclidean properties. A central challenge in this field is to define convolution on domains, which inherently possess irregular and non-Euclidean structures. In this work, we introduce Quasi-conformal Convolution (QCC), a novel framework for defining convolution on Riemann surfaces using quasi-conformal theories. Each QCC operator is linked to a specific quasi-conformal mapping, enabling the adjustment of the convolution operation through manipulation of this mapping. By utilizing trainable estimator modules that produce Quasi-conformal mappings, QCC facilitates adaptive and learnable convolution operators that can be dynamically adjusted according to the underlying data structured on Riemann surfaces. QCC unifies a broad range of spatially defined convolutions, facilitating the learning of tailored convolution operators on each underlying surface optimized for specific tasks. Building on this foundation, we develop the Quasi-Conformal Convolutional Neural Network (QCCNN) to address a variety of tasks related to geometric data. We validate the efficacy of QCCNN through the classification of images defined on curvilinear Riemann surfaces, demonstrating superior performance in this context. Additionally, we explore its potential in medical applications, including craniofacial analysis using 3D facial data and lesion segmentation on 3D human faces, achieving enhanced accuracy and reliability.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Approximation-Based Trajectory Prediction and Tracking with 4D Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) is vital for autonomous vehicles, yet LiDAR and camera-based methods degrade in adverse weather. Meanwhile, Radar-based solutions remain robust but often suffer from limited vertical resolution and simplistic motion models. Existing Kalman filter-based approaches also rely on fixed noise covariance, hampering adaptability when objects make sudden maneuvers. We propose Bayes-4DRTrack, a 4D Radar-based MOT framework that adopts a transformer-based motion prediction network to capture nonlinear motion dynamics and employs Bayesian approximation in both detection and prediction steps. Moreover, our two-stage data association leverages Doppler measurements to better distinguish closely spaced targets. Evaluated on the K-Radar dataset (including adverse weather scenarios), Bayes-4DRTrack demonstrates a 5.7% gain in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (AMOTA) over methods with traditional motion models and fixed noise covariance. These results showcase enhanced robustness and accuracy in demanding, real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>Evolving Symbolic 3D Visual Grounder with Weakly Supervised Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D visual grounding (3DVG) is challenging because of the requirement of understanding on visual information, language and spatial relationships. While supervised approaches have achieved superior performance, they are constrained by the scarcity and high cost of 3D vision-language datasets. On the other hand, LLM/VLM based agents are proposed for 3DVG, eliminating the need for training data. However, these methods incur prohibitive time and token costs during inference. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel training-free symbolic framework for 3D visual grounding, namely Evolvable Symbolic Visual Grounder, that offers significantly reduced inference costs compared to previous agent-based methods while maintaining comparable performance. EaSe uses LLM generated codes to compute on spatial relationships. EaSe also implements an automatic pipeline to evaluate and optimize the quality of these codes and integrate VLMs to assist in the grounding process. Experimental results demonstrate that EaSe achieves 52.9% accuracy on Nr3D dataset and 49.2% Acc@0.25 on ScanRefer, which is top-tier among training-free methods. Moreover, it substantially reduces the inference time and cost, offering a balanced trade-off between performance and efficiency.

      <title>AdaSVD: Adaptive Singular Value Decomposition for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01403v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their substantial memory requirements present significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has emerged as a promising compression technique for LLMs, offering considerable reductions in memory overhead. However, existing SVD-based methods often struggle to effectively mitigate the errors introduced by SVD truncation, leading to a noticeable performance gap when compared to the original models. Furthermore, applying a uniform compression ratio across all transformer layers fails to account for the varying importance of different layers. To address these challenges, we propose AdaSVD, an adaptive SVD-based LLM compression approach. Specifically, AdaSVD introduces adaComp, which adaptively compensates for SVD truncation errors by alternately updating the singular matrices U and V^T. Additionally, AdaSVD introduces adaCR, which adaptively assigns layer-specific compression ratios based on the relative importance of each layer. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families and evaluation metrics demonstrate that AdaSVD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SVD-based methods, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced memory requirements.

      <title>FourieRF: Few-Shot NeRFs via Progressive Fourier Frequency Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce FourieRF, a novel approach for achieving fast and high-quality reconstruction in the few-shot setting. Our method effectively parameterizes features through an explicit curriculum training procedure, incrementally increasing scene complexity during optimization. Experimental results show that the prior induced by our approach is both robust and adaptable across a wide variety of scenes, establishing FourieRF as a strong and versatile baseline for the few-shot rendering problem. While our approach significantly reduces artifacts, it may still lead to reconstruction errors in severely under-constrained scenarios, particularly where view occlusion leaves parts of the shape uncovered. In the future, our method could be enhanced by integrating foundation models to complete missing parts using large data-driven priors.</description>

      <title>Human Body Restoration with One-Step Diffusion Model and A New Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human body restoration, as a specific application of image restoration, is widely applied in practice and plays a vital role across diverse fields. However, thorough research remains difficult, particularly due to the lack of benchmark datasets. In this study, we propose a high-quality dataset automated cropping and filtering (HQ-ACF) pipeline. This pipeline leverages existing object detection datasets and other unlabeled images to automatically crop and filter high-quality human images. Using this pipeline, we constructed a person-based restoration with sophisticated objects and natural activities (\emph{PERSONA}) dataset, which includes training, validation, and test sets. The dataset significantly surpasses other human-related datasets in both quality and content richness. Finally, we propose \emph{OSDHuman}, a novel one-step diffusion model for human body restoration. Specifically, we propose a high-fidelity image embedder (HFIE) as the prompt generator to better guide the model with low-quality human image information, effectively avoiding misleading prompts. Experimental results show that OSDHuman outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics. The dataset and code will at https://github.com/gobunu/OSDHuman.</description>

      <title>Visual Attention Never Fades: Selective Progressive Attention ReCalibration for Detailed Image Captioning in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detailed image captioning is essential for tasks like data generation and aiding visually impaired individuals. High-quality captions require a balance between precision and recall, which remains challenging for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we hypothesize that this limitation stems from weakening and increasingly noisy visual attention as responses lengthen. To address this issue, we propose SPARC (Selective Progressive Attention ReCalibration), a training-free method that enhances the contribution of visual tokens during decoding. SPARC is founded on three key observations: (1) increasing the influence of all visual tokens reduces recall; thus, SPARC selectively amplifies visual tokens; (2) as captions lengthen, visual attention becomes noisier, so SPARC identifies critical visual tokens by leveraging attention differences across time steps; (3) as visual attention gradually weakens, SPARC reinforces it to preserve its influence. Our experiments, incorporating both automated and human evaluations, demonstrate that existing methods improve the precision of MLLMs at the cost of recall. In contrast, our proposed method enhances both precision and recall with minimal computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Improved Training Technique for Latent Consistency Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consistency models are a new family of generative models capable of producing high-quality samples in either a single step or multiple steps. Recently, consistency models have demonstrated impressive performance, achieving results on par with diffusion models in the pixel space. However, the success of scaling consistency training to large-scale datasets, particularly for text-to-image and video generation tasks, is determined by performance in the latent space. In this work, we analyze the statistical differences between pixel and latent spaces, discovering that latent data often contains highly impulsive outliers, which significantly degrade the performance of iCT in the latent space. To address this, we replace Pseudo-Huber losses with Cauchy losses, effectively mitigating the impact of outliers. Additionally, we introduce a diffusion loss at early timesteps and employ optimal transport (OT) coupling to further enhance performance. Lastly, we introduce the adaptive scaling-$c$ scheduler to manage the robust training process and adopt Non-scaling LayerNorm in the architecture to better capture the statistics of the features and reduce outlier impact. With these strategies, we successfully train latent consistency models capable of high-quality sampling with one or two steps, significantly narrowing the performance gap between latent consistency and diffusion models. The implementation is released here: https://github.com/quandao10/sLCT/</description>

      <title>SPFFNet: Strip Perception and Feature Fusion Spatial Pyramid Pooling for Fabric Defect Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01445v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defect detection in fabrics is critical for quality control, yet existing methods often struggle with complex backgrounds and shape-specific defects. In this paper, we propose an improved fabric defect detection model based on YOLOv11. To enhance the detection of strip defects, we introduce a Strip Perception Module (SPM) that improves feature capture through multi-scale convolution. We further enhance the spatial pyramid pooling fast (SPPF) by integrating a squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, resulting in the SE-SPPF module, which better integrates spatial and channel information for more effective defect feature extraction. Additionally, we propose a novel focal enhanced complete intersection over union (FECIoU) metric with adaptive weights, addressing scale differences and class imbalance by adjusting the weights of hard-to-detect instances through focal loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a 0.8-8.1% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) on the Tianchi dataset and a 1.6-13.2% improvement on our custom dataset, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Temporal-consistent CAMs for Weakly Supervised Video Segmentation in Waste Sorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In industrial settings, weakly supervised (WS) methods are usually preferred over their fully supervised (FS) counterparts as they do not require costly manual annotations. Unfortunately, the segmentation masks obtained in the WS regime are typically poor in terms of accuracy. In this work, we present a WS method capable of producing accurate masks for semantic segmentation in the case of video streams. More specifically, we build saliency maps that exploit the temporal coherence between consecutive frames in a video, promoting consistency when objects appear in different frames. We apply our method in a waste-sorting scenario, where we perform weakly supervised video segmentation (WSVS) by training an auxiliary classifier that distinguishes between videos recorded before and after a human operator, who manually removes specific wastes from a conveyor belt. The saliency maps of this classifier identify materials to be removed, and we modify the classifier training to minimize differences between the saliency map of a central frame and those in adjacent frames, after having compensated object displacement. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the benefits of integrating temporal coherence directly during the training phase of the classifier. Code and dataset are available upon request.</description>

      <title>Deep Unfolding Multi-modal Image Fusion Network via Attribution Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal image fusion synthesizes information from multiple sources into a single image, facilitating downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation. Current approaches primarily focus on acquiring informative fusion images at the visual display stratum through intricate mappings. Although some approaches attempt to jointly optimize image fusion and downstream tasks, these efforts often lack direct guidance or interaction, serving only to assist with a predefined fusion loss. To address this, we propose an ``Unfolding Attribution Analysis Fusion network'' (UAAFusion), using attribution analysis to tailor fused images more effectively for semantic segmentation, enhancing the interaction between the fusion and segmentation. Specifically, we utilize attribution analysis techniques to explore the contributions of semantic regions in the source images to task discrimination. At the same time, our fusion algorithm incorporates more beneficial features from the source images, thereby allowing the segmentation to guide the fusion process. Our method constructs a model-driven unfolding network that uses optimization objectives derived from attribution analysis, with an attribution fusion loss calculated from the current state of the segmentation network. We also develop a new pathway function for attribution analysis, specifically tailored to the fusion tasks in our unfolding network. An attribution attention mechanism is integrated at each network stage, allowing the fusion network to prioritize areas and pixels crucial for high-level recognition tasks. Additionally, to mitigate the information loss in traditional unfolding networks, a memory augmentation module is incorporated into our network to improve the information flow across various network layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in image fusion and applicability to semantic segmentation.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Automatic Picking and Manual Picking Refinement for First-Break</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-break picking is a pivotal procedure in processing microseismic data for geophysics and resource exploration. Recent advancements in deep learning have catalyzed the evolution of automated methods for identifying first-break. Nevertheless, the complexity of seismic data acquisition and the requirement for detailed, expert-driven labeling often result in outliers and potential mislabeling within manually labeled datasets. These issues can negatively affect the training of neural networks, necessitating algorithms that handle outliers or mislabeled data effectively. We introduce the Simultaneous Picking and Refinement (SPR) algorithm, designed to handle datasets plagued by outlier samples or even noisy labels. Unlike conventional approaches that regard manual picks as ground truth, our method treats the true first-break as a latent variable within a probabilistic model that includes a first-break labeling prior. SPR aims to uncover this variable, enabling dynamic adjustments and improved accuracy across the dataset. This strategy mitigates the impact of outliers or inaccuracies in manual labels. Intra-site picking experiments and cross-site generalization experiments on publicly available data confirm our method's performance in identifying first-break and its generalization across different sites. Additionally, our investigations into noisy signals and labels underscore SPR's resilience to both types of noise and its capability to refine misaligned manual annotations. Moreover, the flexibility of SPR, not being limited to any single network architecture, enhances its adaptability across various deep learning-based picking methods. Focusing on learning from data that may contain outliers or partial inaccuracies, SPR provides a robust solution to some of the principal obstacles in automatic first-break picking.</description>

Abstract: Image recognition models have struggled to treat recognition robustness to real-world degradations. In this context, data augmentation methods like PixMix improve robustness but rely on generative arts and feature visualizations (FVis), which have copyright, drawing cost, and scalability issues. We propose MoireDB, a formula-generated interference-fringe image dataset for image augmentation enhancing robustness. MoireDB eliminates copyright concerns, reduces dataset assembly costs, and enhances robustness by leveraging illusory patterns. Experiments show that MoireDB augmented images outperforms traditional Fractal arts and FVis-based augmentations, making it a scalable and effective solution for improving model robustness against real-world degradations.</description>

      <title>End-to-end Training for Text-to-Image Synthesis using Dual-Text Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis is a challenging task that requires modeling complex interactions between two modalities ( i.e., text and image). A common framework adopted in recent state-of-the-art approaches to achieving such multimodal interactions is to bootstrap the learning process with pre-trained image-aligned text embeddings trained using contrastive loss. Furthermore, these embeddings are typically trained generically and reused across various synthesis models. In contrast, we explore an approach to learning text embeddings specifically tailored to the T2I synthesis network, trained in an end-to-end fashion. Further, we combine generative and contrastive training and use two embeddings, one optimized to enhance the photo-realism of the generated images, and the other seeking to capture text-to-image alignment. A comprehensive set of experiments on three text-to-image benchmark datasets (Oxford-102, Caltech-UCSD, and MS-COCO) reveal that having two separate embeddings gives better results than using a shared one and that such an approach performs favourably in comparison with methods that use text representations from a pre-trained text encoder trained using a discriminative approach. Finally, we demonstrate that such learned embeddings can be used in other contexts as well, such as text-to-image manipulation.</description>

      <title>BD-Diff: Generative Diffusion Model for Image Deblurring on Unknown Domains with Blur-Decoupled Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models trained on large-scale datasets have achieved remarkable progress in image synthesis. In favor of their ability to supplement missing details and generate aesthetically pleasing contents, recent works have applied them to image deblurring tasks via training an adapter on blurry-sharp image pairs to provide structural conditions for restoration. However, acquiring substantial amounts of realistic paired data is challenging and costly in real-world scenarios. On the other hand, relying solely on synthetic data often results in overfitting, leading to unsatisfactory performance when confronted with unseen blur patterns. To tackle this issue, we propose BD-Diff, a generative-diffusion-based model designed to enhance deblurring performance on unknown domains by decoupling structural features and blur patterns through joint training on three specially designed tasks. We employ two Q-Formers as structural representations and blur patterns extractors separately. The features extracted by them will be used for the supervised deblurring task on synthetic data and the unsupervised blur-transfer task by leveraging unpaired blurred images from the target domain simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce a reconstruction task to make the structural features and blur patterns complementary. This blur-decoupled learning process enhances the generalization capabilities of BD-Diff when encountering unknown domain blur patterns. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that BD-Diff outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in blur removal and structural preservation in various challenging scenarios. The codes will be released in https://github.com/donahowe/BD-Diff</description>

      <title>Efficiently Integrate Large Language Models with Visual Perception: A Survey from the Training Paradigm Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of vision-language modalities has been a significant focus in multimodal learning, traditionally relying on Vision-Language Pretrained Models. However, with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been a notable shift towards incorporating LLMs with vision modalities. Following this, the training paradigms for incorporating vision modalities into LLMs have evolved. Initially, the approach was to integrate the modalities through pretraining the modality integrator, named Single-stage Tuning. It has since branched out into methods focusing on performance enhancement, denoted as Two-stage Tuning, and those prioritizing parameter efficiency, referred to as Direct Adaptation. However, existing surveys primarily address the latest Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with Two-stage Tuning, leaving a gap in understanding the evolution of training paradigms and their unique parameter-efficient considerations. This paper categorizes and reviews 34 VLLMs from top conferences, journals, and highly cited Arxiv papers, focusing on parameter efficiency during adaptation from the training paradigm perspective. We first introduce the architecture of LLMs and parameter-efficient learning methods, followed by a discussion on vision encoders and a comprehensive taxonomy of modality integrators. We then review three training paradigms and their efficiency considerations, summarizing benchmarks in the VLLM field. To gain deeper insights into their effectiveness in parameter efficiency, we compare and discuss the experimental results of representative models, among which the experiment of the Direct Adaptation paradigm is replicated. Providing insights into recent developments and practical uses, this survey is a vital guide for researchers and practitioners navigating the efficient integration of vision modalities into LLMs.</description>

      <title>The in-context inductive biases of vision-language models differ across modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inductive biases are what allow learners to make guesses in the absence of conclusive evidence. These biases have often been studied in cognitive science using concepts or categories -- e.g. by testing how humans generalize a new category from a few examples that leave the category boundary ambiguous. We use these approaches to study generalization in foundation models during in-context learning. Modern foundation models can condition on both vision and text, and differences in how they interpret and learn from these different modalities is an emerging area of study. Here, we study how their generalizations vary by the modality in which stimuli are presented, and the way the stimuli are described in text. We study these biases with three different experimental paradigms, across three different vision-language models. We find that the models generally show some bias towards generalizing according to shape over color. This shape bias tends to be amplified when the examples are presented visually. By contrast, when examples are presented in text, the ordering of adjectives affects generalization. However, the extent of these effects vary across models and paradigms. These results help to reveal how vision-language models represent different types of inputs in context, and may have practical implications for the use of vision-language models.</description>

Abstract: Objective: Assessing Alzheimer's disease (AD) using high-dimensional radiology images is clinically important but challenging. Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has advanced AD diagnosis, it remains unclear how to design AI models embracing predictability and explainability. Here, we propose VisTA, a multimodal language-vision model assisted by contrastive learning, to optimize disease prediction and evidence-based, interpretable explanations for clinical decision-making.
  Methods: We developed VisTA (Vision-Text Alignment Model) for AD diagnosis. Architecturally, we built VisTA from BiomedCLIP and fine-tuned it using contrastive learning to align images with verified abnormalities and their descriptions. To train VisTA, we used a constructed reference dataset containing images, abnormality types, and descriptions verified by medical experts. VisTA produces four outputs: predicted abnormality type, similarity to reference cases, evidence-driven explanation, and final AD diagnoses. To illustrate VisTA's efficacy, we reported accuracy metrics for abnormality retrieval and dementia prediction. To demonstrate VisTA's explainability, we compared its explanations with human experts' explanations.
  Results: Compared to 15 million images used for baseline pretraining, VisTA only used 170 samples for fine-tuning and obtained significant improvement in abnormality retrieval and dementia prediction. For abnormality retrieval, VisTA reached 74% accuracy and an AUC of 0.87 (26% and 0.74, respectively, from baseline models). For dementia prediction, VisTA achieved 88% accuracy and an AUC of 0.82 (30% and 0.57, respectively, from baseline models). The generated explanations agreed strongly with human experts' and provided insights into the diagnostic process. Taken together, VisTA optimize prediction, clinical reasoning, and explanation.</description>

      <title>FireCastNet: Earth-as-a-Graph for Seasonal Fire Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With climate change expected to exacerbate fire weather conditions, the accurate and timely anticipation of wildfires becomes increasingly crucial for disaster mitigation. In this study, we utilize SeasFire, a comprehensive global wildfire dataset with climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, and human-related variables, to enable seasonal wildfire forecasting with machine learning. For the predictive analysis, we present FireCastNet, a novel architecture which combines a 3D convolutional encoder with GraphCast, originally developed for global short-term weather forecasting using graph neural networks. FireCastNet is trained to capture the context leading to wildfires, at different spatial and temporal scales. Our investigation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of our model in predicting the presence of burned areas at varying forecasting time horizons globally, extending up to six months into the future, and on how different spatial or/and temporal context affects the performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning models in seasonal fire forecasting; longer input time-series leads to more robust predictions, while integrating spatial information to capture wildfire spatio-temporal dynamics boosts performance. Finally, our results hint that in order to enhance performance at longer forecasting horizons, a larger receptive field spatially needs to be considered.</description>

      <title>GauCho: Gaussian Distributions with Cholesky Decomposition for Oriented Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oriented Object Detection (OOD) has received increased attention in the past years, being a suitable solution for detecting elongated objects in remote sensing analysis. In particular, using regression loss functions based on Gaussian distributions has become attractive since they yield simple and differentiable terms. However, existing solutions are still based on regression heads that produce Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBBs), and the known problem of angular boundary discontinuity persists. In this work, we propose a regression head for OOD that directly produces Gaussian distributions based on the Cholesky matrix decomposition. The proposed head, named GauCho, theoretically mitigates the boundary discontinuity problem and is fully compatible with recent Gaussian-based regression loss functions. Furthermore, we advocate using Oriented Ellipses (OEs) to represent oriented objects, which relates to GauCho through a bijective function and alleviates the encoding ambiguity problem for circular objects. Our experimental results show that GauCho can be a viable alternative to the traditional OBB head, achieving results comparable to or better than state-of-the-art detectors for the challenging dataset DOTA</description>

      <title>MakeAnything: Harnessing Diffusion Transformers for Multi-Domain Procedural Sequence Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to create complex artifacts through structured multi-step processes. Generating procedural tutorials with AI is a longstanding but challenging goal, facing three key obstacles: (1) scarcity of multi-task procedural datasets, (2) maintaining logical continuity and visual consistency between steps, and (3) generalizing across multiple domains. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-domain dataset covering 21 tasks with over 24,000 procedural sequences. Building upon this foundation, we introduce MakeAnything, a framework based on the diffusion transformer (DIT), which leverages fine-tuning to activate the in-context capabilities of DIT for generating consistent procedural sequences. We introduce asymmetric low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for image generation, which balances generalization capabilities and task-specific performance by freezing encoder parameters while adaptively tuning decoder layers. Additionally, our ReCraft model enables image-to-process generation through spatiotemporal consistency constraints, allowing static images to be decomposed into plausible creation sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MakeAnything surpasses existing methods, setting new performance benchmarks for procedural generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Robust-LLaVA: On the Effectiveness of Large-Scale Robust Image Encoders for Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks but remain vulnerable to visual adversarial perturbations that can induce hallucinations, manipulate responses, or bypass safety mechanisms. Existing methods seek to mitigate these risks by applying constrained adversarial fine-tuning to CLIP vision encoders on ImageNet-scale data, ensuring their generalization ability is preserved. However, this limited adversarial training restricts robustness and broader generalization. In this work, we explore an alternative approach of leveraging existing vision classification models that have been adversarially pre-trained on large-scale data. Our analysis reveals two principal contributions: (1) the extensive scale and diversity of adversarial pre-training enables these models to demonstrate superior robustness against diverse adversarial threats, ranging from imperceptible perturbations to advanced jailbreaking attempts, without requiring additional adversarial training, and (2) end-to-end MLLM integration with these robust models facilitates enhanced adaptation of language components to robust visual features, outperforming existing plug-and-play methodologies on complex reasoning tasks. Through systematic evaluation across visual question-answering, image captioning, and jail-break attacks, we demonstrate that MLLMs trained with these robust models achieve superior adversarial robustness while maintaining favorable clean performance. Our framework achieves 2x and 1.5x average robustness gains in captioning and VQA tasks, respectively, and delivers over 10% improvement against jailbreak attacks.

      <title>MFP-VTON: Enhancing Mask-Free Person-to-Person Virtual Try-On via Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The garment-to-person virtual try-on (VTON) task, which aims to generate fitting images of a person wearing a reference garment, has made significant strides. However, obtaining a standard garment is often more challenging than using the garment already worn by the person. To improve ease of use, we propose MFP-VTON, a Mask-Free framework for Person-to-Person VTON. Recognizing the scarcity of person-to-person data, we adapt a garment-to-person model and dataset to construct a specialized dataset for this task. Our approach builds upon a pretrained diffusion transformer, leveraging its strong generative capabilities. During mask-free model fine-tuning, we introduce a Focus Attention loss to emphasize the garment of the reference person and the details outside the garment of the target person. Experimental results demonstrate that our model excels in both person-to-person and garment-to-person VTON tasks, generating high-fidelity fitting images.</description>

      <title>SliderSpace: Decomposing the Visual Capabilities of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SliderSpace, a framework for automatically decomposing the visual capabilities of diffusion models into controllable and human-understandable directions. Unlike existing control methods that require a user to specify attributes for each edit direction individually, SliderSpace discovers multiple interpretable and diverse directions simultaneously from a single text prompt. Each direction is trained as a low-rank adaptor, enabling compositional control and the discovery of surprising possibilities in the model's latent space. Through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art diffusion models, we demonstrate SliderSpace's effectiveness across three applications: concept decomposition, artistic style exploration, and diversity enhancement. Our quantitative evaluation shows that SliderSpace-discovered directions decompose the visual structure of model's knowledge effectively, offering insights into the latent capabilities encoded within diffusion models. User studies further validate that our method produces more diverse and useful variations compared to baselines. Our code, data and trained weights are available at https://sliderspace.baulab.info</description>

      <title>LSU-Net: Lightweight Automatic Organs Segmentation Network For Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: UNet and its variants have widespread applications in medical image segmentation. However, the substantial number of parameters and computational complexity of these models make them less suitable for use in clinical settings with limited computational resources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Lightweight Shift U-Net (LSU-Net). We integrate the Light Conv Block and the Tokenized Shift Block in a lightweight manner, combining them with a dynamic weight multi-loss design for efficient dynamic weight allocation. The Light Conv Block effectively captures features with a low parameter count by combining standard convolutions with depthwise separable convolutions. The Tokenized Shift Block optimizes feature representation by shifting and capturing deep features through a combination of the Spatial Shift Block and depthwise separable convolutions. Dynamic adjustment of the loss weights at each layer approaches the optimal solution and enhances training stability. We validated LSU-Net on the UWMGI and MSD Colon datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that LSU-Net outperforms most state-of-the-art segmentation architectures.</description>

      <title>Deep Ensembling with Multimodal Image Fusion for Efficient Classification of Lung Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on the classification of cancerous and healthy slices from multimodal lung images. The data used in the research comprises Computed Tomography (CT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images. The proposed strategy achieves the fusion of PET and CT images by utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and an Autoencoder. Subsequently, a new ensemble-based classifier developed, Deep Ensembled Multimodal Fusion (DEMF), employing majority voting to classify the sample images under examination. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) employed to visualize the classification accuracy of cancer-affected images. Given the limited sample size, a random image augmentation strategy employed during the training phase. The DEMF network helps mitigate the challenges of scarce data in computer-aided medical image analysis. The proposed network compared with state-of-the-art networks across three publicly available datasets. The network outperforms others based on the metrics - Accuracy, F1-Score, Precision, and Recall. The investigation results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed network.</description>

      <title>Advanced Assessment of Stroke in Retinal Fundus Imaging with Deep Multi-view Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stroke is globally a major cause of mortality and morbidity, and hence accurate and rapid diagnosis of stroke is valuable. Retinal fundus imaging reveals the known markers of elevated stroke risk in the eyes, which are retinal venular widening, arteriolar narrowing, and increased tortuosity. In contrast to other imaging techniques used for stroke diagnosis, the acquisition of fundus images is easy, non-invasive, fast, and inexpensive. Therefore, in this study, we propose a multi-view stroke network (MVS-Net) to detect stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) using retinal fundus images. Contrary to existing studies, our study proposes for the first time a solution to discriminate stroke and TIA with deep multi-view learning by proposing an end-to-end deep network, consisting of multi-view inputs of fundus images captured from both right and left eyes. Accordingly, the proposed MVS-Net defines representative features from fundus images of both eyes and determines the relation within their macula-centered and optic nerve head-centered views. Experiments performed on a dataset collected from stroke and TIA patients, in addition to healthy controls, show that the proposed framework achieves an AUC score of 0.84 for stroke and TIA detection.</description>

      <title>Mobile Robot Navigation Using Hand-Drawn Maps: A Vision Language Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hand-drawn maps can be used to convey navigation instructions between humans and robots in a natural and efficient manner. However, these maps can often contain inaccuracies such as scale distortions and missing landmarks which present challenges for mobile robot navigation. This paper introduces a novel Hand-drawn Map Navigation (HAM-Nav) architecture that leverages pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) for robot navigation across diverse environments, hand-drawing styles, and robot embodiments, even in the presence of map inaccuracies. HAM-Nav integrates a unique Selective Visual Association Prompting approach for topological map-based position estimation and navigation planning as well as a Predictive Navigation Plan Parser to infer missing landmarks. Extensive experiments were conducted in photorealistic simulated environments, using both wheeled and legged robots, demonstrating the effectiveness of HAM-Nav in terms of navigation success rates and Success weighted by Path Length. Furthermore, a user study in real-world environments highlighted the practical utility of hand-drawn maps for robot navigation as well as successful navigation outcomes.</description>

      <title>A Direct Semi-Exhaustive Search Method for Robust, Partial-to-Full Point Cloud Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point cloud registration refers to the problem of finding the rigid transformation that aligns two given point clouds, and is crucial for many applications in robotics and computer vision. The main insight of this paper is that we can directly optimize the point cloud registration problem without correspondences by utilizing an algorithmically simple, yet computationally complex, semi-exhaustive search approach that is very well-suited for parallelization on modern GPUs. Our proposed algorithm, Direct Semi-Exhaustive Search (DSES), iterates over potential rotation matrices and efficiently computes the inlier-maximizing translation associated with each rotation. It then computes the optimal rigid transformation based on any desired distance metric by directly computing the error associated with each transformation candidate $\{R, t\}$. By leveraging the parallelism of modern GPUs, DSES outperforms state-of-the-art methods for partial-to-full point cloud registration on the simulated ModelNet40 benchmark and demonstrates high performance and robustness for pose estimation on a real-world robotics problem (https://youtu.be/q0q2-s2KSuA).</description>

      <title>Multimodal MRI-Ultrasound AI for Prostate Cancer Detection Outperforms Radiologist MRI Interpretation: A Multi-Center Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-biopsy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used to target suspicious prostate lesions. This has led to artificial intelligence (AI) applications improving MRI-based detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (CsPCa). However, MRI-detected lesions must still be mapped to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images during biopsy, which results in missing CsPCa. This study systematically evaluates a multimodal AI framework integrating MRI and TRUS image sequences to enhance CsPCa identification. The study included 3110 patients from three cohorts across two institutions who underwent prostate biopsy. The proposed framework, based on the 3D UNet architecture, was evaluated on 1700 test cases, comparing performance to unimodal AI models that use either MRI or TRUS alone. Additionally, the proposed model was compared to radiologists in a cohort of 110 patients. The multimodal AI approach achieved superior sensitivity (80%) and Lesion Dice (42%) compared to unimodal MRI (73%, 30%) and TRUS models (49%, 27%). Compared to radiologists, the multimodal model showed higher specificity (88% vs. 78%) and Lesion Dice (38% vs. 33%), with equivalent sensitivity (79%). Our findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal AI to improve CsPCa lesion targeting during biopsy and treatment planning, surpassing current unimodal models and radiologists; ultimately improving outcomes for prostate cancer patients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MRI quality control (QC) is challenging due to unbalanced and limited datasets, as well as subjective scoring, which hinder the development of reliable automated QC systems. To address these issues, we introduce an approach that pretrains a model on synthetically generated motion artifacts before applying transfer learning for QC classification. This method not only improves the accuracy in identifying poor-quality scans but also reduces training time and resource requirements compared to training from scratch. By leveraging synthetic data, we provide a more robust and resource-efficient solution for QC automation in MRI, paving the way for broader adoption in diverse research settings.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Deep Human-in-the-Loop Optimization for Retinal Implants Using Sighted Participants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-in-the-loop optimization (HILO) is a promising approach for personalizing visual prostheses by iteratively refining stimulus parameters based on user feedback. Previous work demonstrated HILO's efficacy in simulation, but its performance with human participants remains untested. Here we evaluate HILO using sighted participants viewing simulated prosthetic vision to assess its ability to optimize stimulation strategies under realistic conditions. Participants selected between phosphenes generated by competing encoders to iteratively refine a deep stimulus encoder (DSE). We tested HILO in three conditions: standard optimization, threshold misspecifications, and out-of-distribution parameter sampling. Participants consistently preferred HILO-generated stimuli over both a na\"ive encoder and the DSE alone, with log odds favoring HILO across all conditions. We also observed key differences between human and simulated decision-making, highlighting the importance of validating optimization strategies with human participants. These findings support HILO as a viable approach for adapting visual prostheses to individuals.</description>

      <title>Fantastic Multi-Task Gradient Updates and How to Find Them In a Cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Balancing competing objectives remains a fundamental challenge in multi-task learning (MTL), primarily due to conflicting gradients across individual tasks. A common solution relies on computing a dynamic gradient update vector that balances competing tasks as optimization progresses. Building on this idea, we propose ConicGrad, a principled, scalable, and robust MTL approach formulated as a constrained optimization problem. Our method introduces an angular constraint to dynamically regulate gradient update directions, confining them within a cone centered on the reference gradient of the overall objective. By balancing task-specific gradients without over-constraining their direction or magnitude, ConicGrad effectively resolves inter-task gradient conflicts. Moreover, our framework ensures computational efficiency and scalability to high-dimensional parameter spaces. We conduct extensive experiments on standard supervised learning and reinforcement learning MTL benchmarks, and demonstrate that ConicGrad achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks.</description>

      <title>Fast Solvers for Discrete Diffusion Models: Theory and Applications of High-Order Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful generative modeling framework for discrete data with successful applications spanning from text generation to image synthesis. However, their deployment faces challenges due to the high dimensionality of the state space, necessitating the development of efficient inference algorithms. Current inference approaches mainly fall into two categories: exact simulation and approximate methods such as $\tau$-leaping. While exact methods suffer from unpredictable inference time and redundant function evaluations, $\tau$-leaping is limited by its first-order accuracy. In this work, we advance the latter category by tailoring the first extension of high-order numerical inference schemes to discrete diffusion models, enabling larger step sizes while reducing error. We rigorously analyze the proposed schemes and establish the second-order accuracy of the $\theta$-trapezoidal method in KL divergence. Empirical evaluations on GPT-2 level text and ImageNet-level image generation tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample quality compared to existing approaches under equivalent computational constraints.</description>

      <title>Mordal: Automated Pretrained Model Selection for Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating multiple modalities into large language models (LLMs) is a powerful way to enhance their understanding of non-textual data, enabling them to perform multimodal tasks. Vision language models (VLMs) form the fastest growing category of multimodal models because of their many practical use cases, including in healthcare, robotics, and accessibility. Unfortunately, even though different VLMs in the literature demonstrate impressive visual capabilities in different benchmarks, they are handcrafted by human experts; there is no automated framework to create task-specific multimodal models.
  We introduce Mordal, an automated multimodal model search framework that efficiently finds the best VLM for a user-defined task without manual intervention. Mordal achieves this both by reducing the number of candidates to consider during the search process and by minimizing the time required to evaluate each remaining candidate. Our evaluation shows that Mordal can find the best VLM for a given problem using up to $8.9\times$--$11.6\times$ lower GPU hours than grid search. In the process of our evaluation, we have also discovered new VLMs that outperform their state-of-the-art counterparts.</description>

      <title>Patch Triplet Similarity Purification for Guided Real-World Low-Dose CT Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image denoising of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is an important problem for clinical diagnosis with reduced radiation exposure. Previous methods are mostly trained with pairs of synthetic or misaligned LDCT and normal-dose CT (NDCT) images. However, trained with synthetic noise or misaligned LDCT/NDCT image pairs, the denoising networks would suffer from blurry structure or motion artifacts. Since non-contrast CT (NCCT) images share the content characteristics to the corresponding NDCT images in a three-phase scan, they can potentially provide useful information for real-world LDCT image denoising. To exploit this aspect, in this paper, we propose to incorporate clean NCCT images as useful guidance for the learning of real-world LDCT image denoising networks. To alleviate the issue of spatial misalignment in training data, we design a new Patch Triplet Similarity Purification (PTSP) strategy to select highly similar patch (instead of image) triplets of LDCT, NDCT, and NCCT images for network training. Furthermore, we modify two image denoising transformers of SwinIR and HAT to accommodate the NCCT image guidance, by replacing vanilla self-attention with cross-attention. On our collected clinical dataset, the modified transformers trained with the data selected by our PTSP strategy show better performance than 15 comparison methods on real-world LDCT image denoising. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our NCCT image guidance and PTSP strategy. We will publicly release our data and code.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Permutation Symmetry of Transformers: The Role of Rotation for Model Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry in the parameter space of deep neural networks (DNNs) has proven beneficial for various deep learning applications. A well-known example is the permutation symmetry in Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), where permuting the rows of weight matrices in one layer and applying the inverse permutation to adjacent layers yields a functionally equivalent model. While permutation symmetry fully characterizes the equivalence set for MLPs, its discrete nature limits its utility for transformers. In this paper, we introduce rotation symmetry, a novel form of parameter space symmetry for transformers that generalizes permutation symmetry by rotating parameter matrices in self-attention layers. Unlike permutation symmetry, rotation symmetry operates in a continuous domain, thereby significantly expanding the equivalence set for transformers. Based on this property, we propose a theoretically optimal parameter matching algorithm as a plug-and-play module to enhance model fusion. We evaluate our approach using pre-trained transformers across diverse natural language and vision tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our rotation symmetry-based matching algorithm substantially improves model fusion, highlighting the potential of parameter space symmetry to facilitate model fusion. Our code is available on https://github.com/zhengzaiyi/RotationSymmetry.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Estimation of Manipulation Skill and Hand Grasp Force from Forearm Ultrasound Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of human hand configuration and the forces they exert is critical for effective teleoperation and skill transfer in robotic manipulation. A deeper understanding of human interactions with objects can further enhance teleoperation performance. To address this need, researchers have explored methods to capture and translate human manipulation skills and applied forces to robotic systems. Among these, biosignal-based approaches, particularly those using forearm ultrasound data, have shown significant potential for estimating hand movements and finger forces. In this study, we present a method for simultaneously estimating manipulation skills and applied hand force using forearm ultrasound data. Data collected from seven participants were used to train deep learning models for classifying manipulation skills and estimating grasp force. Our models achieved an average classification accuracy of 94.87 percent plus or minus 10.16 percent for manipulation skills and an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.51 plus or minus 0.19 Newtons for force estimation, as evaluated using five-fold cross-validation. These results highlight the effectiveness of forearm ultrasound in advancing human-machine interfacing and robotic teleoperation for complex manipulation tasks. This work enables new and effective possibilities for human-robot skill transfer and tele-manipulation, bridging the gap between human dexterity and robotic control.</description>

      <title>K Nearest Neighbor-Guided Trajectory Similarity Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory similarity is fundamental to many spatio-temporal data mining applications. Recent studies propose deep learning models to approximate conventional trajectory similarity measures, exploiting their fast inference time once trained. Although efficient inference has been reported, challenges remain in similarity approximation accuracy due to difficulties in trajectory granularity modeling and in exploiting similarity signals in the training data. To fill this gap, we propose TSMini, a highly effective trajectory similarity model with a sub-view modeling mechanism capable of learning multi-granularity trajectory patterns and a k nearest neighbor-based loss that guides TSMini to learn not only absolute similarity values between trajectories but also their relative similarity ranks. Together, these two innovations enable highly accurate trajectory similarity approximation. Experiments show that TSMini can outperform the state-of-the-art models by 22% in accuracy on average when learning trajectory similarity measures.</description>

      <title>A Study on the Performance of U-Net Modifications in Retroperitoneal Tumor Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The retroperitoneum hosts a variety of tumors, including rare benign and malignant types, which pose diagnostic and treatment challenges due to their infrequency and proximity to vital structures. Estimating tumor volume is difficult due to their irregular shapes, and manual segmentation is time-consuming. Automatic segmentation using U-Net and its variants, incorporating Vision Transformer (ViT) elements, has shown promising results but struggles with high computational demands. To address this, architectures like the Mamba State Space Model (SSM) and Extended Long-Short Term Memory (xLSTM) offer efficient solutions by handling long-range dependencies with lower resource consumption. This study evaluates U-Net enhancements, including CNN, ViT, Mamba, and xLSTM, on a new in-house CT dataset and a public organ segmentation dataset. The proposed ViLU-Net model integrates Vi-blocks for improved segmentation. Results highlight xLSTM's efficiency in the U-Net framework. The code is publicly accessible on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Prostate-Specific Foundation Models for Enhanced Detection of Clinically Significant Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00366v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prostate cancer diagnosis remains challenging. Even when using MRI, radiologists exhibit low specificity and significant inter-observer variability, leading to potential delays or inaccuracies in identifying clinically significant cancers. This leads to numerous unnecessary biopsies and risks of missing clinically significant cancers. Here we present prostate vision contrastive network (ProViCNet), prostate organ-specific vision foundation models for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Trans-Rectal Ultrasound imaging (TRUS) for comprehensive cancer detection. ProViCNet was trained and validated using 4,401 patients across six institutions, as a prostate cancer detection model on radiology images relying on patch-level contrastive learning guided by biopsy confirmed radiologist annotations. ProViCNet demonstrated consistent performance across multiple internal and external validation cohorts with area under the receiver operating curve values ranging from 0.875 to 0.966, significantly outperforming radiologists in the reader study (0.907 versus 0.805, p&lt;0.001) for mpMRI, while achieving 0.670 to 0.740 for TRUS. We also integrated ProViCNet with standard PSA to develop a virtual screening test, and we showed that we can maintain the high sensitivity for detecting clinically significant cancers while more than doubling specificity from 15% to 38% (p&lt;0.001), thereby substantially reducing unnecessary biopsies. These findings highlight that ProViCNet's potential for enhancing prostate cancer diagnosis accuracy and reduce unnecessary biopsies, thereby optimizing diagnostic pathways.</description>

Abstract: Current research in speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) primarily concentrates on translation accuracy and speech naturalness, often overlooking key elements like paralinguistic information, which is essential for conveying emotions and attitudes in communication. To address this, our research introduces a novel, carefully curated multilingual dataset from various movie audio tracks. Each dataset pair is precisely matched for paralinguistic information and duration. We enhance this by integrating multiple prosody transfer techniques, aiming for translations that are accurate, natural-sounding, and rich in paralinguistic details. Our experimental results confirm that our model retains more paralinguistic information from the source speech while maintaining high standards of translation accuracy and naturalness.</description>

      <title>FlexCloud: Direct, Modular Georeferencing and Drift-Correction of Point Cloud Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current software stacks for real-world applications of autonomous driving leverage map information to ensure reliable localization, path planning, and motion prediction. An important field of research is the generation of point cloud maps, referring to the topic of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). As most recent developments do not include global position data, the resulting point cloud maps suffer from internal distortion and missing georeferencing, preventing their use for map-based localization approaches. Therefore, we propose FlexCloud for an automatic georeferencing of point cloud maps created from SLAM. Our approach is designed to work modularly with different SLAM methods, utilizing only the generated local point cloud map and its odometry. Using the corresponding GNSS positions enables direct georeferencing without additional control points. By leveraging a 3D rubber-sheet transformation, we can correct distortions within the map caused by long-term drift while maintaining its structure. Our approach enables the creation of consistent, globally referenced point cloud maps from data collected by a mobile mapping system (MMS). The source code of our work is available at https://github.com/TUMFTM/FlexCloud.</description>

      <title>Segment Anything for Histopathology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleus segmentation is an important analysis task in digital pathology. However, methods for automatic segmentation often struggle with new data from a different distribution, requiring users to manually annotate nuclei and retrain data-specific models. Vision foundation models (VFMs), such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), offer a more robust alternative for automatic and interactive segmentation. Despite their success in natural images, a foundation model for nucleus segmentation in histopathology is still missing. Initial efforts to adapt SAM have shown some success, but did not yet introduce a comprehensive model for diverse segmentation tasks. To close this gap, we introduce PathoSAM, a VFM for nucleus segmentation, based on training SAM on a diverse dataset. Our extensive experiments show that it is the new state-of-the-art model for automatic and interactive nucleus instance segmentation in histopathology. We also demonstrate how it can be adapted for other segmentation tasks, including semantic nucleus segmentation. For this task, we show that it yields results better than popular methods, while not yet beating the state-of-the-art, CellViT. Our models are open-source and compatible with popular tools for data annotation. We also provide scripts for whole-slide image segmentation. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/patho-sam.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the reliability and safety of automated decision-making is crucial. This paper proposes a new approach for measuring the reliability of predictions in machine learning models. We analyze how the outputs of a trained neural network change using clustering to measure distances between outputs and class centroids. We propose this distance as a metric to evaluate the confidence of predictions. We assign each prediction to a cluster with centroid representing the mean softmax output for all correct predictions of a given class. We then define a safety threshold for a class as the smallest distance from an incorrect prediction to the given class centroid. We evaluate the approach on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets using a Convolutional Neural Network and a Vision Transformer, respectively. The results show that our approach is consistent across these data sets and network models, and indicate that the proposed metric can offer an efficient way of determining when automated predictions are acceptable and when they should be deferred to human operators.</description>

      <title>Weak-to-Strong Diffusion with Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of diffusion generative models is to align the learned distribution with the real data distribution through gradient score matching. However, inherent limitations in training data quality, modeling strategies, and architectural design lead to inevitable gap between generated outputs and real data. To reduce this gap, we propose Weak-to-Strong Diffusion (W2SD), a novel framework that utilizes the estimated difference between existing weak and strong models (i.e., weak-to-strong difference) to approximate the gap between an ideal model and a strong model. By employing a reflective operation that alternates between denoising and inversion with weak-to-strong difference, we theoretically understand that W2SD steers latent variables along sampling trajectories toward regions of the real data distribution. W2SD is highly flexible and broadly applicable, enabling diverse improvements through the strategic selection of weak-to-strong model pairs (e.g., DreamShaper vs. SD1.5, good experts vs. bad experts in MoE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that W2SD significantly improves human preference, aesthetic quality, and prompt adherence, achieving SOTA performance across various modalities (e.g., image, video), architectures (e.g., UNet-based, DiT-based, MoE), and benchmarks. For example, Juggernaut-XL with W2SD can improve with the HPSv2 winning rate up to 90% over the original results. Moreover, the performance gains achieved by W2SD markedly outweigh its additional computational overhead, while the cumulative improvements from different weak-to-strong difference further solidify its practical utility and deployability.</description>

      <title>VertiFormer: A Data-Efficient Multi-Task Transformer for Off-Road Robot Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sophisticated learning architectures, e.g., Transformers, present a unique opportunity for robots to understand complex vehicle-terrain kinodynamic interactions for off-road mobility. While internet-scale data are available for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) tasks to train Transformers, real-world mobility data are difficult to acquire with physical robots navigating off-road terrain. Furthermore, training techniques specifically designed to process text and image data in NLP and CV may not apply to robot mobility. In this paper, we propose VertiFormer, a novel data-efficient multi-task Transformer model trained with only one hour of data to address such challenges of applying Transformer architectures for robot mobility on extremely rugged, vertically challenging, off-road terrain. Specifically, VertiFormer employs a new learnable masked modeling and next token prediction paradigm to predict the next pose, action, and terrain patch to enable a variety of off-road mobility tasks simultaneously, e.g., forward and inverse kinodynamics modeling. The non-autoregressive design mitigates computational bottlenecks and error propagation associated with autoregressive models. VertiFormer's unified modality representation also enhances learning of diverse temporal mappings and state representations, which, combined with multiple objective functions, further improves model generalization. Our experiments offer insights into effectively utilizing Transformers for off-road robot mobility with limited data and demonstrate our efficiently trained Transformer can facilitate multiple off-road mobility tasks onboard a physical mobile robot.</description>

      <title>Integrating Frequency Guidance into Multi-source Domain Generalization for Bearing Fault Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent generalizable fault diagnosis researches have effectively tackled the distributional shift between unseen working conditions. Most of them mainly focus on learning domain-invariant representation through feature-level methods. However, the increasing numbers of unseen domains may lead to domain-invariant features contain instance-level spurious correlations, which impact the previous models' generalizable ability. To address the limitations, we propose the Fourier-based Augmentation Reconstruction Network, namely FARNet.The methods are motivated by the observation that the Fourier phase component and amplitude component preserve different semantic information of the signals, which can be employed in domain augmentation techniques. The network comprises an amplitude spectrum sub-network and a phase spectrum sub-network, sequentially reducing the discrepancy between the source and target domains. To construct a more robust generalized model, we employ a multi-source domain data augmentation strategy in the frequency domain. Specifically, a Frequency-Spatial Interaction Module (FSIM) is introduced to handle global information and local spatial features, promoting representation learning between the two sub-networks. To refine the decision boundary of our model output compared to conventional triplet loss, we propose a manifold triplet loss to contribute to generalization. Through extensive experiments on the CWRU and SJTU datasets, FARNet demonstrates effective performance and achieves superior results compared to current cross-domain approaches on the benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Distribution-aware Fairness Learning in Medical Image Segmentation From A Control-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring fairness in medical image segmentation is critical due to biases in imbalanced clinical data acquisition caused by demographic attributes (e.g., age, sex, race) and clinical factors (e.g., disease severity). To address these challenges, we introduce Distribution-aware Mixture of Experts (dMoE), inspired by optimal control theory. We provide a comprehensive analysis of its underlying mechanisms and clarify dMoE's role in adapting to heterogeneous distributions in medical image segmentation. Furthermore, we integrate dMoE into multiple network architectures, demonstrating its broad applicability across diverse medical image analysis tasks. By incorporating demographic and clinical factors, dMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance on two 2D benchmark datasets and a 3D in-house dataset. Our results highlight the effectiveness of dMoE in mitigating biases from imbalanced distributions, offering a promising approach to bridging control theory and medical image segmentation within fairness learning paradigms. The source code will be made available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present generative predictive control (GPC), a learning control framework that (i) clones a generative diffusion-based policy from expert demonstrations, (ii) trains a predictive action-conditioned world model from both expert demonstrations and random explorations, and (iii) synthesizes an online planner that ranks and optimizes the action proposals from (i) by looking ahead into the future using the world model from (ii). Crucially, we show that conditional video diffusion allows learning (near) physics-accurate visual world models and enable robust visual foresight. Focusing on planar pushing with rich contact and collision, we show GPC dominates behavior cloning across state-based and vision-based, simulated and real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>MM-IQ: Benchmarking Human-Like Abstraction and Reasoning in Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: IQ testing has served as a foundational methodology for evaluating human cognitive capabilities, deliberately decoupling assessment from linguistic background, language proficiency, or domain-specific knowledge to isolate core competencies in abstraction and reasoning. Yet, artificial intelligence research currently lacks systematic benchmarks to quantify these critical cognitive dimensions in multimodal systems. To address this critical gap, we propose MM-IQ, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 2,710 meticulously curated test items spanning 8 distinct reasoning paradigms.
  Through systematic evaluation of leading open-source and proprietary multimodal models, our benchmark reveals striking limitations: even state-of-the-art architectures achieve only marginally superior performance to random chance (27.49% vs. 25% baseline accuracy). This substantial performance chasm highlights the inadequacy of current multimodal systems in approximating fundamental human reasoning capacities, underscoring the need for paradigm-shifting advancements to bridge this cognitive divide.</description>

      <title>Registration-Enhanced Segmentation Method for Prostate Cancer in Ultrasound Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prostate cancer is a major cause of cancer-related deaths in men, where early detection greatly improves survival rates. Although MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy offers superior accuracy by combining MRI's detailed visualization with TRUS's real-time guidance, it is a complex and time-intensive procedure that relies heavily on manual annotations, leading to potential errors. To address these challenges, we propose a fully automatic MRI-TRUS fusion-based segmentation method that identifies prostate tumors directly in TRUS images without requiring manual annotations. Unlike traditional multimodal fusion approaches that rely on naive data concatenation, our method integrates a registration-segmentation framework to align and leverage spatial information between MRI and TRUS modalities. This alignment enhances segmentation accuracy and reduces reliance on manual effort. Our approach was validated on a dataset of 1,747 patients from Stanford Hospital, achieving an average Dice coefficient of 0.212, outperforming TRUS-only (0.117) and naive MRI-TRUS fusion (0.132) methods, with significant improvements (p $&lt;$ 0.01). This framework demonstrates the potential for reducing the complexity of prostate cancer diagnosis and provides a flexible architecture applicable to other multimodal medical imaging tasks.</description>

      <title>BEEM: Boosting Performance of Early Exit DNNs using Multi-Exit Classifiers as Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early Exit (EE) techniques have emerged as a means to reduce inference latency in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The latency improvement and accuracy in these techniques crucially depend on the criteria used to make exit decisions. We propose a new decision criterion where exit classifiers are treated as experts BEEM and aggregate their confidence scores. The confidence scores are aggregated only if neighbouring experts are consistent in prediction as the samples pass through them, thus capturing their ensemble effect. A sample exits when the aggregated confidence value exceeds a threshold. The threshold is set using the error rates of the intermediate exits aiming to surpass the performance of conventional DNN inference. Experimental results on the COCO dataset for Image captioning and GLUE datasets for various language tasks demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of state-of-the-art EE methods, achieving improvements in speed-up by a factor 1.5x to 2.1x. When compared to the final layer, its accuracy is comparable in harder Image Captioning and improves in the easier language tasks.

      <title>An Event-Based Perception Pipeline for a Table Tennis Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Table tennis robots gained traction over the last years and have become a popular research challenge for control and perception algorithms. Fast and accurate ball detection is crucial for enabling a robotic arm to rally the ball back successfully. So far, most table tennis robots use conventional, frame-based cameras for the perception pipeline. However, frame-based cameras suffer from motion blur if the frame rate is not high enough for fast-moving objects. Event-based cameras, on the other hand, do not have this drawback since pixels report changes in intensity asynchronously and independently, leading to an event stream with a temporal resolution on the order of us. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first real-time perception pipeline for a table tennis robot that uses only event-based cameras. We show that compared to a frame-based pipeline, event-based perception pipelines have an update rate which is an order of magnitude higher. This is beneficial for the estimation and prediction of the ball's position, velocity, and spin, resulting in lower mean errors and uncertainties. These improvements are an advantage for the robot control, which has to be fast, given the short time a table tennis ball is flying until the robot has to hit back.</description>

      <title>Continuity-Preserving Convolutional Autoencoders for Learning Continuous Latent Dynamical Models from Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous dynamical systems are cornerstones of many scientific and engineering disciplines. While machine learning offers powerful tools to model these systems from trajectory data, challenges arise when these trajectories are captured as images, resulting in pixel-level observations that are discrete in nature. Consequently, a naive application of a convolutional autoencoder can result in latent coordinates that are discontinuous in time. To resolve this, we propose continuity-preserving convolutional autoencoders (CpAEs) to learn continuous latent states and their corresponding continuous latent dynamical models from discrete image frames. We present a mathematical formulation for learning dynamics from image frames, which illustrates issues with previous approaches and motivates our methodology based on promoting the continuity of convolution filters, thereby preserving the continuity of the latent states. This approach enables CpAEs to produce latent states that evolve continuously with the underlying dynamics, leading to more accurate latent dynamical models. Extensive experiments across various scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of CpAEs.</description>

      <title>Privacy Preserving Properties of Vision Classifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision classifiers are often trained on proprietary datasets containing sensitive information, yet the models themselves are frequently shared openly under the privacy-preserving assumption. Although these models are assumed to protect sensitive information in their training data, the extent to which this assumption holds for different architectures remains unexplored. This assumption is challenged by inversion attacks which attempt to reconstruct training data from model weights, exposing significant privacy vulnerabilities. In this study, we systematically evaluate the privacy-preserving properties of vision classifiers across diverse architectures, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Using network inversion-based reconstruction techniques, we assess the extent to which these architectures memorize and reveal training data, quantifying the relative ease of reconstruction across models. Our analysis highlights how architectural differences, such as input representation, feature extraction mechanisms, and weight structures, influence privacy risks. By comparing these architectures, we identify which are more resilient to inversion attacks and examine the trade-offs between model performance and privacy preservation, contributing to the development of secure and privacy-respecting machine learning models for sensitive applications. Our findings provide actionable insights into the design of secure and privacy-aware machine learning systems, emphasizing the importance of evaluating architectural decisions in sensitive applications involving proprietary or personal data.</description>

      <title>Vision-centric Token Compression in Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00791v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, excelling in handling longer sequences. However, the inefficiency and redundancy in processing extended in-context tokens remain a challenge. Many attempts to address this rely on compressing tokens with smaller text encoders, yet we question whether text encoders are truly indispensable. Our journey leads to an unexpected discovery-a much smaller vision encoder, applied directly to sequences of text tokens, can rival text encoders on text tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small text understanding benchmarks, VIST leads to comparable results with 16% fewer FLOPs and 50% less memory usage. We further uncover significant token redundancy and devise a frequency-based masking strategy to guide the focus of the visual encoder toward the most critical tokens. Interestingly, we observe the trained visual encoder performs like a summarizer, selectively ignoring less important words such as prepositions and conjunctions. This approach delivers remarkable results, outperforming traditional text encoder-based methods by 5.7% on average over benchmarks like TriviaQA, NQ, PopQA, TREF, SST2, and SST5, setting a new standard for token efficiency in LLMs.</description>

      <title>OOD Detection with immature Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Likelihood-based deep generative models (DGMs) have gained significant attention for their ability to approximate the distributions of high-dimensional data. However, these models lack a performance guarantee in assigning higher likelihood values to in-distribution (ID) inputs, data the models are trained on, compared to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. This counter-intuitive behaviour is particularly pronounced when ID inputs are more complex than OOD data points. One potential approach to address this challenge involves leveraging the gradient of a data point with respect to the parameters of the DGMs. A recent OOD detection framework proposed estimating the joint density of layer-wise gradient norms for a given data point as a model-agnostic method, demonstrating superior performance compared to the Typicality Test across likelihood-based DGMs and image dataset pairs. In particular, most existing methods presuppose access to fully converged models, the training of which is both time-intensive and computationally demanding. In this work, we demonstrate that using immature models,stopped at early stages of training, can mostly achieve equivalent or even superior results on this downstream task compared to mature models capable of generating high-quality samples that closely resemble ID data. This novel finding enhances our understanding of how DGMs learn the distribution of ID data and highlights the potential of leveraging partially trained models for downstream tasks. Furthermore, we offer a possible explanation for this unexpected behaviour through the concept of support overlap.</description>

      <title>Paper Copilot: The Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Community Should Adopt a More Transparent and Regulated Peer Review Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of submissions to top-tier Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) conferences has prompted many venues to transition from closed to open review platforms. Some have fully embraced open peer reviews, allowing public visibility throughout the process, while others adopt hybrid approaches, such as releasing reviews only after final decisions or keeping reviews private despite using open peer review systems. In this work, we analyze the strengths and limitations of these models, highlighting the growing community interest in transparent peer review. To support this discussion, we examine insights from Paper Copilot, a website launched two years ago to aggregate and analyze AI / ML conference data while engaging a global audience. The site has attracted over 200,000 early-career researchers, particularly those aged 18-34 from 177 countries, many of whom are actively engaged in the peer review process. Drawing on our findings, this position paper advocates for a more transparent, open, and well-regulated peer review aiming to foster greater community involvement and propel advancements in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language navigation in unknown environments is crucial for mobile robots. In scenarios such as household assistance and rescue, mobile robots need to understand a human command, such as "find a person wearing black". We present a novel vision-language navigation (VL-Nav) system that integrates efficient spatial reasoning on low-power robots. Unlike prior methods that rely on a single image-level feature similarity to guide a robot, we introduce the heuristic-vision-language (HVL) spatial reasoning for goal point selection. It combines pixel-wise vision-language features and heuristic exploration to enable efficient navigation to human-instructed instances in various environments robustly. We deploy VL-Nav on a four-wheel mobile robot and conduct comprehensive navigation tasks in various environments of different scales and semantic complexities, indoors and outdoors. Remarkably, VL-Nav operates at a real-time frequency of 30 Hz with a Jetson Orin NX, highlighting its ability to conduct efficient vision-language navigation. Experimental results show that VL-Nav achieves an overall success rate of 86.3%, outperforming previous methods by 44.15%.</description>

      <title>RandLoRA: Full-rank parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have shown impressive results in reducing the number of trainable parameters and memory requirements of large transformer networks while maintaining fine-tuning performance. However, the low-rank nature of the weight update inherently limits the representation power of fine-tuned models, potentially compromising performance on complex tasks. This raises a critical question: when a performance gap between LoRA and standard fine-tuning is observed, is it due to the reduced number of trainable parameters or the rank deficiency? This paper aims to answer this question by introducing RandLoRA, a parameter-efficient method that performs full-rank updates using a learned linear combinations of low-rank, non-trainable random matrices. Our method limits the number of trainable parameters by restricting optimization to diagonal scaling matrices applied to the fixed random matrices. This allows us to effectively overcome the low-rank limitations while maintaining parameter and memory efficiency during training. Through extensive experimentation across vision, language, and vision-language benchmarks, we systematically evaluate the limitations of LoRA and existing random basis methods. Our findings reveal that full-rank updates are beneficial across vision and language tasks individually, and even more so for vision-language tasks, where RandLoRA significantly reduces -- and sometimes eliminates -- the performance gap between standard fine-tuning and LoRA, demonstrating its efficacy.</description>

      <title>UASTHN: Uncertainty-Aware Deep Homography Estimation for UAV Satellite-Thermal Geo-localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geo-localization is an essential component of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation systems to ensure precise absolute self-localization in outdoor environments. To address the challenges of GPS signal interruptions or low illumination, Thermal Geo-localization (TG) employs aerial thermal imagery to align with reference satellite maps to accurately determine the UAV's location. However, existing TG methods lack uncertainty measurement in their outputs, compromising system robustness in the presence of textureless or corrupted thermal images, self-similar or outdated satellite maps, geometric noises, or thermal images exceeding satellite maps. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents \textit{UASTHN}, a novel approach for Uncertainty Estimation (UE) in Deep Homography Estimation (DHE) tasks for TG applications. Specifically, we introduce a novel Crop-based Test-Time Augmentation (CropTTA) strategy, which leverages the homography consensus of cropped image views to effectively measure data uncertainty. This approach is complemented by Deep Ensembles (DE) employed for model uncertainty, offering comparable performance with improved efficiency and seamless integration with any DHE model. Extensive experiments across multiple DHE models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CropTTA in TG applications. Analysis of detected failure cases underscores the improved reliability of CropTTA under challenging conditions. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of combining CropTTA and DE for a comprehensive assessment of both data and model uncertainty. Our research provides profound insights into the broader intersection of localization and uncertainty estimation. The code and data is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Emotional Face-to-Speech</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How much can we infer about an emotional voice solely from an expressive face? This intriguing question holds great potential for applications such as virtual character dubbing and aiding individuals with expressive language disorders. Existing face-to-speech methods offer great promise in capturing identity characteristics but struggle to generate diverse vocal styles with emotional expression. In this paper, we explore a new task, termed emotional face-to-speech, aiming to synthesize emotional speech directly from expressive facial cues. To that end, we introduce DEmoFace, a novel generative framework that leverages a discrete diffusion transformer (DiT) with curriculum learning, built upon a multi-level neural audio codec. Specifically, we propose multimodal DiT blocks to dynamically align text and speech while tailoring vocal styles based on facial emotion and identity. To enhance training efficiency and generation quality, we further introduce a coarse-to-fine curriculum learning algorithm for multi-level token processing. In addition, we develop an enhanced predictor-free guidance to handle diverse conditioning scenarios, enabling multi-conditional generation and disentangling complex attributes effectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DEmoFace generates more natural and consistent speech compared to baselines, even surpassing speech-driven methods. Demos are shown at https://demoface-ai.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Feature Tracking Reliability for Visual Navigation using Real-Time Safety Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision sensors are extensively used for localizing a robot's pose, particularly in environments where global localization tools such as GPS or motion capture systems are unavailable. In many visual navigation systems, localization is achieved by detecting and tracking visual features or landmarks, which provide information about the sensor's relative pose. For reliable feature tracking and accurate pose estimation, it is crucial to maintain visibility of a sufficient number of features. This requirement can sometimes conflict with the robot's overall task objective. In this paper, we approach it as a constrained control problem. By leveraging the invariance properties of visibility constraints within the robot's kinematic model, we propose a real-time safety filter based on quadratic programming. This filter takes a reference velocity command as input and produces a modified velocity that minimally deviates from the reference while ensuring the information score from the currently visible features remains above a user-specified threshold. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed safety filter preserves the invariance condition and ensures the visibility of more features than the required minimum. We also validated its real-world performance by integrating it into a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, where it maintained high estimation quality in challenging environments, outperforming a simple tracking controller.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust and Generalizable Lensless Imaging with Modular Learned Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lensless cameras disregard the conventional design that imaging should mimic the human eye. This is done by replacing the lens with a thin mask, and moving image formation to the digital post-processing. State-of-the-art lensless imaging techniques use learned approaches that combine physical modeling and neural networks. However, these approaches make simplifying modeling assumptions for ease of calibration and computation. Moreover, the generalizability of learned approaches to lensless measurements of new masks has not been studied. To this end, we utilize a modular learned reconstruction in which a key component is a pre-processor prior to image recovery. We theoretically demonstrate the pre-processor's necessity for standard image recovery techniques (Wiener filtering and iterative algorithms), and through extensive experiments show its effectiveness for multiple lensless imaging approaches and across datasets of different mask types (amplitude and phase). We also perform the first generalization benchmark across mask types to evaluate how well reconstructions trained with one system generalize to others. Our modular reconstruction enables us to use pre-trained components and transfer learning on new systems to cut down weeks of tedious measurements and training. As part of our work, we open-source four datasets, and software for measuring datasets and for training our modular reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Learning to Learn Weight Generation via Trajectory Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based algorithms have emerged as promising techniques for weight generation, particularly in scenarios like multi-task learning that require frequent weight updates. However, existing solutions suffer from limited cross-task transferability. In addition, they only utilize optimal weights as training samples, ignoring the value of other weights in the optimization process. To address these issues, we propose Lt-Di, which integrates the diffusion algorithm with meta-learning to generate weights for unseen tasks. Furthermore, we extend the vanilla diffusion algorithm into a trajectory diffusion algorithm to utilize other weights along the optimization trajectory. Trajectory diffusion decomposes the entire diffusion chain into multiple shorter ones, improving training and inference efficiency. We analyze the convergence properties of the weight generation paradigm and improve convergence efficiency without additional time overhead. Our experiments demonstrate Lt-Di's higher accuracy while reducing computational overhead across various tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, multi-domain generalization, and large-scale language model fine-tuning.Our code is released at https://github.com/tuantuange/Lt-Di.</description>

      <title>MIND: Modality-Informed Knowledge Distillation Framework for Multimodal Clinical Prediction Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal fusion leverages information across modalities to learn better feature representations with the goal of improving performance in fusion-based tasks. However, multimodal datasets, especially in medical settings, are typically smaller than their unimodal counterparts, which can impede the performance of multimodal models. Additionally, the increase in the number of modalities is often associated with an overall increase in the size of the multimodal network, which may be undesirable in medical use cases. Utilizing smaller unimodal encoders may lead to sub-optimal performance, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional clinical data. In this paper, we propose the Modality-INformed knowledge Distillation (MIND) framework, a multimodal model compression approach based on knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge from ensembles of pre-trained deep neural networks of varying sizes into a smaller multimodal student. The teacher models consist of unimodal networks, allowing the student to learn from diverse representations. MIND employs multi-head joint fusion models, as opposed to single-head models, enabling the use of unimodal encoders in the case of unimodal samples without requiring imputation or masking of absent modalities. As a result, MIND generates an optimized multimodal model, enhancing both multimodal and unimodal representations. It can also be leveraged to balance multimodal learning during training. We evaluate MIND on binary and multilabel clinical prediction tasks using time series data and chest X-ray images. Additionally, we assess the generalizability of the MIND framework on three non-medical multimodal multiclass datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MIND enhances the performance of the smaller multimodal network across all five tasks, as well as various fusion methods and multimodal architectures, compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Towards Agile Swarming in Real World: Onboard Relative Localization with Fast Tracking of Active Blinking Markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel onboard tracking approach enabling vision-based relative localization and communication using Active blinking Marker Tracking (AMT) is introduced in this article. Active blinking markers on multi-robot team members improve the robustness of relative localization for aerial vehicles in tightly coupled swarms during real-world deployments, while also serving as a resilient communication channel. Traditional tracking algorithms struggle to track fast moving blinking markers due to their intermittent appearance in the camera frames. AMT addresses this by using weighted polynomial regression to predict the future appearance of active blinking markers while accounting for uncertainty in the prediction. In outdoor experiments, the AMT approach outperformed state-of-the-art methods in tracking density, accuracy, and complexity. The experimental validation of this novel tracking approach for relative localization involved testing motion patterns motivated by our research on agile multi-robot deployment.</description>

      <title>Compressed Image Generation with Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01189v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel generative approach based on Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), which produces high-quality image samples along with their losslessly compressed bit-stream representations. This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</description>

      <title>Land Surface Temperature Super-Resolution with a Scale-Invariance-Free Neural Approach: Application to MODIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the trade-off between the temporal and spatial resolution of thermal spaceborne sensors, super-resolution methods have been developed to provide fine-scale Land SurfaceTemperature (LST) maps. Most of them are trained at low resolution but applied at fine resolution, and so they require a scale-invariance hypothesis that is not always adapted. Themain contribution of this work is the introduction of a Scale-Invariance-Free approach for training Neural Network (NN) models, and the implementation of two NN models, calledScale-Invariance-Free Convolutional Neural Network for Super-Resolution (SIF-CNN-SR) for the super-resolution of MODIS LST products. The Scale-Invariance-Free approach consists ontraining the models in order to provide LST maps at high spatial resolution that recover the initial LST when they are degraded at low resolution and that contain fine-scale texturesinformed by the high resolution NDVI. The second contribution of this work is the release of a test database with ASTER LST images concomitant with MODIS ones that can be usedfor evaluation of super-resolution algorithms. We compare the two proposed models, SIF-CNN-SR1 and SIF-CNN-SR2, with four state-of-the-art methods, Bicubic, DMS, ATPRK, Tsharp,and a CNN sharing the same architecture as SIF-CNN-SR but trained under the scale-invariance hypothesis. We show that SIF-CNN-SR1 outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and the other two CNN models as evaluated with LPIPS and Fourier space metrics focusing on the analysis of textures. These results and the available ASTER-MODIS database for evaluation are promising for future studies on super-resolution of LST.</description>

      <title>Provable Ordering and Continuity in Vision-Language Pretraining for Generalizable Embodied Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-training vision-language representations on human action videos has emerged as a promising approach to reduce reliance on large-scale expert demonstrations for training embodied agents. However, prior methods often employ time contrastive learning based on goal-reaching heuristics, progressively aligning language instructions from the initial to the final frame. This overemphasis on future frames can result in erroneous vision-language associations, as actions may terminate early or include irrelevant moments in the end. To address this issue, we propose Action Temporal Coherence Learning (AcTOL) to learn ordered and continuous vision-language representations without rigid goal-based constraint. AcTOL treats a video as a continuous trajectory where it (1) contrasts semantic differences between frames to reflect their natural ordering, and (2) imposes a local Brownian bridge constraint to ensure smooth transitions across intermediate frames. Extensive imitation learning experiments across varying numbers of demonstrations show that the pretrained features significantly enhance downstream manipulation tasks by up to 49% with high robustness to different linguistic styles of instructions, offering a viable pathway toward generalized embodied agents. The source code is included in the supplementary material for reference.</description>

      <title>Learnable polynomial, trigonometric, and tropical activations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates scalable neural networks with learnable activation functions based on orthogonal function bases and tropical polynomials, targeting ImageNet-1K classification and next token prediction on OpenWebText. Traditional activations, such as ReLU, are static. In contrast, learnable activations enable the network to adapt dynamically during training. However, stability issues, such as vanishing or exploding gradients, arise with improper variance management in deeper networks. To remedy this, we propose an initialization scheme that single-handedly preserves unitary variance in transformers and convolutional networks, ensuring stable gradient flow even in deep architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that networks with Hermite, Fourier, and Tropical-based learnable activations significantly improve over GPT-2 and ConvNeXt networks in terms of accuracy and perplexity in train and test, highlighting the viability of learnable activations in large-scale tasks. The activation functions developed here are the subject of a library coded entirely in pure PyTorch: torchortho, available at https://github.com/K-H-Ismail/torchortho.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Double-Blind Federated Adaptation of Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The availability of foundational models (FMs) pre-trained on large-scale data has advanced the state-of-the-art in many computer vision tasks. While FMs have demonstrated good zero-shot performance on many image classification tasks, there is often scope for performance improvement by adapting the FM to the downstream task. However, the data that is required for this adaptation typically exists in silos across multiple entities (data owners) and cannot be collated at a central location due to regulations and privacy concerns. At the same time, a learning service provider (LSP) who owns the FM cannot share the model with the data owners due to proprietary reasons. In some cases, the data owners may not even have the resources to store such large FMs. Hence, there is a need for algorithms to adapt the FM in a double-blind federated manner, i.e., the data owners do not know the FM or each other's data, and the LSP does not see the data for the downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a framework for double-blind federated adaptation of FMs using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). The proposed framework first decomposes the FM into a sequence of FHE-friendly blocks through knowledge distillation. The resulting FHE-friendly model is adapted for the downstream task via low-rank parallel adapters that can be learned without backpropagation through the FM. Since the proposed framework requires the LSP to share intermediate representations with the data owners, we design a privacy-preserving permutation scheme to prevent the data owners from learning the FM through model extraction attacks. Finally, a secure aggregation protocol is employed for federated learning of the low-rank parallel adapters. Empirical results on four datasets demonstrate the practical feasibility of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Deep generative computed perfusion-deficit mapping of ischaemic stroke</title>

Abstract: Focal deficits in ischaemic stroke result from impaired perfusion downstream of a critical vascular occlusion. While parenchymal lesions are traditionally used to predict clinical deficits, the underlying pattern of disrupted perfusion provides information upstream of the lesion, potentially yielding earlier predictive and localizing signals. Such perfusion maps can be derived from routine CT angiography (CTA) widely deployed in clinical practice. Analysing computed perfusion maps from 1,393 CTA-imaged-patients with acute ischaemic stroke, we use deep generative inference to localise neural substrates of NIHSS sub-scores. We show that our approach replicates known lesion-deficit relations without knowledge of the lesion itself and reveals novel neural dependents. The high achieved anatomical fidelity suggests acute CTA-derived computed perfusion maps may be of substantial clinical-and-scientific value in rich phenotyping of acute stroke. Using only hyperacute imaging, deep generative inference could power highly expressive models of functional anatomical relations in ischaemic stroke within the pre-interventional window.</description>

      <title>Diffusion at Absolute Zero: Langevin Sampling Using Successive Moreau Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we propose a novel method for sampling from Gibbs distributions of the form $\pi(x)\propto\exp(-U(x))$ with a potential $U(x)$. In particular, inspired by diffusion models we propose to consider a sequence $(\pi^{t_k})_k$ of approximations of the target density, for which $\pi^{t_k}\approx \pi$ for $k$ small and, on the other hand, $\pi^{t_k}$ exhibits favorable properties for sampling for $k$ large. This sequence is obtained by replacing parts of the potential $U$ by its Moreau envelopes. Sampling is performed in an Annealed Langevin type procedure, that is, sequentially sampling from $\pi^{t_k}$ for decreasing $k$, effectively guiding the samples from a simple starting density to the more complex target. In addition to a theoretical analysis we show experimental results supporting the efficacy of the method in terms of increased convergence speed and applicability to multi-modal densities $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Inverse Bridge Matching Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning diffusion bridge models is easy; making them fast and practical is an art. Diffusion bridge models (DBMs) are a promising extension of diffusion models for applications in image-to-image translation. However, like many modern diffusion and flow models, DBMs suffer from the problem of slow inference. To address it, we propose a novel distillation technique based on the inverse bridge matching formulation and derive the tractable objective to solve it in practice. Unlike previously developed DBM distillation techniques, the proposed method can distill both conditional and unconditional types of DBMs, distill models in a one-step generator, and use only the corrupted images for training. We evaluate our approach for both conditional and unconditional types of bridge matching on a wide set of setups, including super-resolution, JPEG restoration, sketch-to-image, and other tasks, and show that our distillation technique allows us to accelerate the inference of DBMs from 4x to 100x and even provide better generation quality than used teacher model depending on particular setup.</description>

      <title>Detecting Backdoor Samples in Contrastive Language Image Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) has been found to be vulnerable to poisoning backdoor attacks where the adversary can achieve an almost perfect attack success rate on CLIP models by poisoning only 0.01\% of the training dataset. This raises security concerns on the current practice of pretraining large-scale models on unscrutinized web data using CLIP. In this work, we analyze the representations of backdoor-poisoned samples learned by CLIP models and find that they exhibit unique characteristics in their local subspace, i.e., their local neighborhoods are far more sparse than that of clean samples. Based on this finding, we conduct a systematic study on detecting CLIP backdoor attacks and show that these attacks can be easily and efficiently detected by traditional density ratio-based local outlier detectors, whereas existing backdoor sample detection methods fail. Our experiments also reveal that an unintentional backdoor already exists in the original CC3M dataset and has been trained into a popular open-source model released by OpenCLIP. Based on our detector, one can clean up a million-scale web dataset (e.g., CC3M) efficiently within 15 minutes using 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs. The code is publicly available in our \href{https://github.com/HanxunH/Detect-CLIP-Backdoor-Samples}{GitHub repository}.</description>

      <title>Learning Traffic Anomalies from Generative Models on Real-Time Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate detection of traffic anomalies is crucial for effective urban traffic management and congestion mitigation. We use the Spatiotemporal Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) framework combining Graph Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data. We apply STGAN to real-time, minute-by-minute observations from 42 traffic cameras across Gothenburg, Sweden, collected over several months in 2020. The images are processed to compute a flow metric representing vehicle density, which serves as input for the model. Training is conducted on data from April to November 2020, and validation is performed on a separate dataset from November 14 to 23, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the model effectively detects traffic anomalies with high precision and low false positive rates. The detected anomalies include camera signal interruptions, visual artifacts, and extreme weather conditions affecting traffic flow.</description>

      <title>Assessing the use of Diffusion models for motion artifact correction in brain MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging generally requires long exposure times, while being sensitive to patient motion, resulting in artifacts in the acquired images, which may hinder their diagnostic relevance. Despite research efforts to decrease the acquisition time, and designing efficient acquisition sequences, motion artifacts are still a persistent problem, pushing toward the need for the development of automatic motion artifact correction techniques. Recently, diffusion models have been proposed as a solution for the task at hand. While diffusion models can produce high-quality reconstructions, they are also susceptible to hallucination, which poses risks in diagnostic applications. In this study, we critically evaluate the use of diffusion models for correcting motion artifacts in 2D brain MRI scans. Using a popular benchmark dataset, we compare a diffusion model-based approach with state-of-the-art methods consisting of Unets trained in a supervised fashion on motion-affected images to reconstruct ground truth motion-free images. Our findings reveal mixed results: diffusion models can produce accurate predictions or generate harmful hallucinations in this context, depending on data heterogeneity and the acquisition planes considered as input.</description>

      <title>Structural features of the fly olfactory circuit mitigate the stability-plasticity dilemma in continual learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks face the stability-plasticity dilemma in continual learning, while the brain can maintain memories and remain adaptable. However, the biological strategies for continual learning and their potential to inspire learning algorithms in neural networks are poorly understood. This study presents a minimal model of the fly olfactory circuit to investigate the biological strategies that support continual odor learning. We introduce the fly olfactory circuit as a plug-and-play component, termed the Fly Model, which can integrate with modern machine learning methods to address this dilemma. Our findings demonstrate that the Fly Model enhances both memory stability and learning plasticity, overcoming the limitations of current continual learning strategies. We validated its effectiveness across various challenging continual learning scenarios using commonly used datasets. The fly olfactory system serves as an elegant biological circuit for lifelong learning, offering a module that enhances continual learning with minimal additional computational cost for machine learning.</description>

      <title>VR-Robo: A Real-to-Sim-to-Real Framework for Visual Robot Navigation and Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent success in legged robot locomotion is attributed to the integration of reinforcement learning and physical simulators. However, these policies often encounter challenges when deployed in real-world environments due to sim-to-real gaps, as simulators typically fail to replicate visual realism and complex real-world geometry. Moreover, the lack of realistic visual rendering limits the ability of these policies to support high-level tasks requiring RGB-based perception like ego-centric navigation. This paper presents a Real-to-Sim-to-Real framework that generates photorealistic and physically interactive "digital twin" simulation environments for visual navigation and locomotion learning. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based scene reconstruction from multi-view images and integrates these environments into simulations that support ego-centric visual perception and mesh-based physical interactions. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we train a reinforcement learning policy within the simulator to perform a visual goal-tracking task. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves RGB-only sim-to-real policy transfer. Additionally, our framework facilitates the rapid adaptation of robot policies with effective exploration capability in complex new environments, highlighting its potential for applications in households and factories.</description>

      <title>mWhisper-Flamingo for Multilingual Audio-Visual Noise-Robust Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) combines lip-based video with audio and can improve performance in noise, but most methods are trained only on English data. One limitation is the lack of large-scale multilingual video data, which makes it hard hard to train models from scratch. In this work, we propose mWhisper-Flamingo for multilingual AVSR which combines the strengths of a pre-trained audio model (Whisper) and video model (AV-HuBERT). To enable better multi-modal integration and improve the noisy multilingual performance, we introduce decoder modality dropout where the model is trained both on paired audio-visual inputs and separate audio/visual inputs. mWhisper-Flamingo achieves state-of-the-art WER on MuAViC, an AVSR dataset of 9 languages. Audio-visual mWhisper-Flamingo consistently outperforms audio-only Whisper on all languages in noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>VideoRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Extreme Long-Context Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) through external knowledge integration, yet its application has primarily focused on textual content, leaving the rich domain of multi-modal video knowledge predominantly unexplored. This paper introduces VideoRAG, the first retrieval-augmented generation framework specifically designed for processing and understanding extremely long-context videos. Our core innovation lies in its dual-channel architecture that seamlessly integrates (i) graph-based textual knowledge grounding for capturing cross-video semantic relationships, and (ii) multi-modal context encoding for efficiently preserving visual features. This novel design empowers VideoRAG to process unlimited-length videos by constructing precise knowledge graphs that span multiple videos while maintaining semantic dependencies through specialized multi-modal retrieval paradigms. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on our proposed LongerVideos benchmark-comprising over 160 videos totaling 134+ hours across lecture, documentary, and entertainment categories-VideoRAG demonstrates substantial performance compared to existing RAG alternatives and long video understanding methods. The source code of VideoRAG implementation and the benchmark dataset are openly available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/VideoRAG.</description>

      <title>SqueezeFacePoseNet: Lightweight Face Verification Across Different Poses for Mobile Platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.08566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtual applications through mobile platforms are one of the most critical and ever-growing fields in AI, where ubiquitous and real-time person authentication has become critical after the breakthrough of all services provided via mobile devices. In this context, face verification technologies can provide reliable and robust user authentication, given the availability of cameras in these devices, as well as their widespread use in everyday applications. The rapid development of deep Convolutional Neural Networks has resulted in many accurate face verification architectures. However, their typical size (hundreds of megabytes) makes them infeasible to be incorporated in downloadable mobile applications where the entire file typically may not exceed 100 Mb. Accordingly, we address the challenge of developing a lightweight face recognition network of just a few megabytes that can operate with sufficient accuracy in comparison to much larger models. The network also should be able to operate under different poses, given the variability naturally observed in uncontrolled environments where mobile devices are typically used. In this paper, we adapt the lightweight SqueezeNet model, of just 4.4MB, to effectively provide cross-pose face recognition. After trained on the MS-Celeb-1M and VGGFace2 databases, our model achieves an EER of 1.23% on the difficult frontal vs. profile comparison, and0.54% on profile vs. profile images. Under less extreme variations involving frontal images in any of the enrolment/query images pair, EER is pushed down to&lt;0.3%, and the FRR at FAR=0.1%to less than 1%. This makes our light model suitable for face recognition where at least acquisition of the enrolment image can be controlled. At the cost of a slight degradation in performance, we also test an even lighter model (of just 2.5MB) where regular convolutions are replaced with depth-wise separable convolutions.</description>

      <title>Information Bottleneck Approach to Spatial Attention Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.03418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The selective visual attention mechanism in the human visual system (HVS) restricts the amount of information to reach visual awareness for perceiving natural scenes, allowing near real-time information processing with limited computational capacity [Koch and Ullman, 1987]. This kind of selectivity acts as an 'Information Bottleneck (IB)', which seeks a trade-off between information compression and predictive accuracy. However, such information constraints are rarely explored in the attention mechanism for deep neural networks (DNNs). In this paper, we propose an IB-inspired spatial attention module for DNN structures built for visual recognition. The module takes as input an intermediate representation of the input image, and outputs a variational 2D attention map that minimizes the mutual information (MI) between the attention-modulated representation and the input, while maximizing the MI between the attention-modulated representation and the task label. To further restrict the information bypassed by the attention map, we quantize the continuous attention scores to a set of learnable anchor values during training. Extensive experiments show that the proposed IB-inspired spatial attention mechanism can yield attention maps that neatly highlight the regions of interest while suppressing backgrounds, and bootstrap standard DNN structures for visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, fine-grained recognition, cross-domain classification). The attention maps are interpretable for the decision making of the DNNs as verified in the experiments. Our code is available at https://github.com/ashleylqx/AIB.git.</description>

      <title>GEB+: A Benchmark for Generic Event Boundary Captioning, Grounding and Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.00486v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cognitive science has shown that humans perceive videos in terms of events separated by the state changes of dominant subjects. State changes trigger new events and are one of the most useful among the large amount of redundant information perceived. However, previous research focuses on the overall understanding of segments without evaluating the fine-grained status changes inside. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset called Kinetic-GEB+. The dataset consists of over 170k boundaries associated with captions describing status changes in the generic events in 12K videos. Upon this new dataset, we propose three tasks supporting the development of a more fine-grained, robust, and human-like understanding of videos through status changes. We evaluate many representative baselines in our dataset, where we also design a new TPD (Temporal-based Pairwise Difference) Modeling method for visual difference and achieve significant performance improvements. Besides, the results show there are still formidable challenges for current methods in the utilization of different granularities, representation of visual difference, and the accurate localization of status changes. Further analysis shows that our dataset can drive developing more powerful methods to understand status changes and thus improve video level comprehension. The dataset including both videos and boundaries is available at https://yuxuan-w.github.io/GEB-plus/</description>

      <title>A hierarchical semantic segmentation framework for computer vision-based bridge damage detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computer vision-based damage detection using remote cameras and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enables efficient and low-cost bridge health monitoring that reduces labor costs and the needs for sensor installation and maintenance. By leveraging recent semantic image segmentation approaches, we are able to find regions of critical structural components and recognize damage at the pixel level using images as the only input. However, existing methods perform poorly when detecting small damages (e.g., cracks and exposed rebars) and thin objects with limited image samples, especially when the components of interest are highly imbalanced. To this end, this paper introduces a semantic segmentation framework that imposes the hierarchical semantic relationship between component category and damage types. For example, certain concrete cracks only present on bridge columns and therefore the non-column region will be masked out when detecting such damages. In this way, the damage detection model could focus on learning features from possible damaged regions only and avoid the effects of other irrelevant regions. We also utilize multi-scale augmentation that provides views with different scales that preserves contextual information of each image without losing the ability of handling small and thin objects. Furthermore, the proposed framework employs important sampling that repeatedly samples images containing rare components (e.g., railway sleeper and exposed rebars) to provide more data samples, which addresses the imbalanced data challenge.</description>

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has attracted considerable attention, which transfers knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a related but unlabeled target domain. Reducing inter-domain differences has always been a crucial factor to improve performance in UDA, especially for tasks where there is a large gap between source and target domains. To this end, we propose a novel style-aware feature fusion method (SAFF) to bridge the large domain gap and transfer knowledge while alleviating the loss of class-discriminative information. Inspired by the human transitive inference and learning ability, a novel style-aware self-intermediate domain (SSID) is investigated to link two seemingly unrelated concepts through a series of intermediate auxiliary synthesized concepts. Specifically, we propose a novel learning strategy of SSID, which selects samples from both source and target domains as anchors, and then randomly fuses the object and style features of these anchors to generate labeled and style-rich intermediate auxiliary features for knowledge transfer. Moreover, we design an external memory bank to store and update specified labeled features to obtain stable class features and class-wise style features. Based on the proposed memory bank, the intra- and inter-domain loss functions are designed to improve the class recognition ability and feature compatibility, respectively. Meanwhile, we simulate the rich latent feature space of SSID by infinite sampling and the convergence of the loss function by mathematical theory. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on commonly used domain adaptive benchmarks to evaluate the proposed SAFF, and the experimental results show that the proposed SAFF can be easily combined with different backbone networks and obtain better performance as a plug-in-plug-out module.</description>

      <title>Optimising Event-Driven Spiking Neural Network with Regularisation and Cutoff</title>

Abstract: Spiking neural network (SNN), as the next generation of artificial neural network (ANN), offer a closer mimicry of natural neural networks and hold promise for significant improvements in computational efficiency. However, the current SNN is trained to infer over a fixed duration, overlooking the potential of dynamic inference in SNN. In this paper, we strengthen the marriage between SNN and event-driven processing with a proposal to consider a cutoff in SNN, which can terminate SNN anytime during inference to achieve efficient inference. Two novel optimisation techniques are presented to achieve inference efficient SNN: a Top-K cutoff and a regularisation.The proposed regularisation influences the training process, optimising SNN for the cutoff, while the Top-K cutoff technique optimises the inference phase. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on multiple benchmark frame-based datasets, such asCIFAR10/100, Tiny-ImageNet, and event-based datasets, including CIFAR10-DVS, N-Caltech101 and DVS128 Gesture. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques in both ANN-to-SNN conversion and direct training, enabling SNNs to require 1.76 to 2.76x fewer timesteps for CIFAR-10, while achieving 1.64 to 1.95x fewer timesteps across all event-based datasets, with near-zero accuracy loss. These findings affirms the compatibility and potential benefits of our techniques in enhancing accuracy and reducing inference latency when integrated with existing methods.

      <title>Generating Continual Human Motion in Diverse 3D Scenes</title>

Abstract: We introduce a method to synthesize animator guided human motion across 3D scenes. Given a set of sparse (3 or 4) joint locations (such as the location of a person's hand and two feet) and a seed motion sequence in a 3D scene, our method generates a plausible motion sequence starting from the seed motion while satisfying the constraints imposed by the provided keypoints. We decompose the continual motion synthesis problem into walking along paths and transitioning in and out of the actions specified by the keypoints, which enables long generation of motions that satisfy scene constraints without explicitly incorporating scene information. Our method is trained only using scene agnostic mocap data. As a result, our approach is deployable across 3D scenes with various geometries. For achieving plausible continual motion synthesis without drift, our key contribution is to generate motion in a goal-centric canonical coordinate frame where the next immediate target is situated at the origin. Our model can generate long sequences of diverse actions such as grabbing, sitting and leaning chained together in arbitrary order, demonstrated on scenes of varying geometry: HPS, Replica, Matterport, ScanNet and scenes represented using NeRFs. Several experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods that navigate paths in 3D scenes.

      <title>DeepScribe: Localization and Classification of Elamite Cuneiform Signs Via Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Twenty-five hundred years ago, the paperwork of the Achaemenid Empire was recorded on clay tablets. In 1933, archaeologists from the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute (OI) found tens of thousands of these tablets and fragments during the excavation of Persepolis. Many of these tablets have been painstakingly photographed and annotated by expert cuneiformists, and now provide a rich dataset consisting of over 5,000 annotated tablet images and 100,000 cuneiform sign bounding boxes. We leverage this dataset to develop DeepScribe, a modular computer vision pipeline capable of localizing cuneiform signs and providing suggestions for the identity of each sign. We investigate the difficulty of learning subtasks relevant to cuneiform tablet transcription on ground-truth data, finding that a RetinaNet object detector can achieve a localization mAP of 0.78 and a ResNet classifier can achieve a top-5 sign classification accuracy of 0.89. The end-to-end pipeline achieves a top-5 classification accuracy of 0.80. As part of the classification module, DeepScribe groups cuneiform signs into morphological clusters. We consider how this automatic clustering approach differs from the organization of standard, printed sign lists and what we may learn from it. These components, trained individually, are sufficient to produce a system that can analyze photos of cuneiform tablets from the Achaemenid period and provide useful transliteration suggestions to researchers. We evaluate the model's end-to-end performance on locating and classifying signs, providing a roadmap to a linguistically-aware transliteration system, then consider the model's potential utility when applied to other periods of cuneiform writing.</description>

      <title>Towards Resource-Efficient Streaming of Large-Scale Medical Image Datasets for Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale medical imaging datasets have accelerated deep learning (DL) for medical image analysis. However, the large scale of these datasets poses a challenge for researchers, resulting in increased storage and bandwidth requirements for hosting and accessing them. Since different researchers have different use cases and require different resolutions or formats for DL, it is neither feasible to anticipate every researcher's needs nor practical to store data in multiple resolutions and formats. To that end, we propose the Medical Image Streaming Toolkit (MIST), a format-agnostic database that enables streaming of medical images at different resolutions and formats from a single high-resolution copy. We evaluated MIST across eight popular, large-scale medical imaging datasets spanning different body parts, modalities, and formats. Our results showed that our framework reduced the storage and bandwidth requirements for hosting and downloading datasets without impacting image quality. We demonstrate that MIST addresses the challenges posed by large-scale medical imaging datasets by building a data-efficient and format-agnostic database to meet the diverse needs of researchers and reduce barriers to DL research in medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Warfare:Breaking the Watermark Protection of AI-Generated Content</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07726v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI-Generated Content (AIGC) is rapidly expanding, with services using advanced generative models to create realistic images and fluent text. Regulating such content is crucial to prevent policy violations, such as unauthorized commercialization or unsafe content distribution. Watermarking is a promising solution for content attribution and verification, but we demonstrate its vulnerability to two key attacks: (1) Watermark removal, where adversaries erase embedded marks to evade regulation, and (2) Watermark forging, where they generate illicit content with forged watermarks, leading to misattribution. We propose Warfare, a unified attack framework leveraging a pre-trained diffusion model for content processing and a generative adversarial network for watermark manipulation. Evaluations across datasets and embedding setups show that Warfare achieves high success rates while preserving content quality. We further introduce Warfare-Plus, which enhances efficiency without compromising effectiveness. The code can be found in https://github.com/GuanlinLee/warfare.</description>

      <title>Implicit Shape and Appearance Priors for Few-Shot Full Head Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in learning techniques that employ coordinate-based neural representations have yielded remarkable results in multi-view 3D reconstruction tasks. However, these approaches often require a substantial number of input views (typically several tens) and computationally intensive optimization procedures to achieve their effectiveness. In this paper, we address these limitations specifically for the problem of few-shot full 3D head reconstruction. We accomplish this by incorporating a probabilistic shape and appearance prior into coordinate-based representations, enabling faster convergence and improved generalization when working with only a few input images (even as low as a single image). During testing, we leverage this prior to guide the fitting process of a signed distance function using a differentiable renderer. By incorporating the statistical prior alongside parallelizable ray tracing and dynamic caching strategies, we achieve an efficient and accurate approach to few-shot full 3D head reconstruction. Moreover, we extend the H3DS dataset, which now comprises 60 high-resolution 3D full head scans and their corresponding posed images and masks, which we use for evaluation purposes. By leveraging this dataset, we demonstrate the remarkable capabilities of our approach in achieving state-of-the-art results in geometry reconstruction while being an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches.</description>

      <title>BinaryHPE: 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation via Binarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D human pose and shape estimation (HPE) aims to reconstruct the 3D human body, face, and hands from a single image. Although powerful deep learning models have achieved accurate estimation in this task, they require enormous memory and computational resources. Consequently, these methods can hardly be deployed on resource-limited edge devices. In this work, we propose BinaryHPE, a novel binarization method designed to estimate the 3D human body, face, and hands parameters efficiently. Specifically, we propose a novel binary backbone called Binarized Dual Residual Network (BiDRN), designed to retain as much full-precision information as possible. Furthermore, we propose the Binarized BoxNet, an efficient sub-network for predicting face and hands bounding boxes, which further reduces model redundancy. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BinaryHPE, which has a significant improvement over state-of-the-art binarization algorithms. Moreover, our BinaryHPE achieves comparable performance with the full-precision method Hand4Whole while using only 22.1% parameters and 14.8% operations. We will release all the code and pretrained models.</description>

      <title>ReFusion: Learning Image Fusion from Reconstruction with Learnable Loss via Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image fusion aims to combine information from multiple source images into a single one with more comprehensive informational content. Deep learning-based image fusion algorithms face significant challenges, including the lack of a definitive ground truth and the corresponding distance measurement. Additionally, current manually defined loss functions limit the model's flexibility and generalizability for various fusion tasks. To address these limitations, we propose ReFusion, a unified meta-learning based image fusion framework that dynamically optimizes the fusion loss for various tasks through source image reconstruction. Compared to existing methods, ReFusion employs a parameterized loss function, that allows the training framework to be dynamically adapted according to the specific fusion scenario and task. ReFusion consists of three key components: a fusion module, a source reconstruction module, and a loss proposal module. We employ a meta-learning strategy to train the loss proposal module using the reconstruction loss. This strategy forces the fused image to be more conducive to reconstruct source images, allowing the loss proposal module to generate a adaptive fusion loss that preserves the optimal information from the source images. The update of the fusion module relies on the learnable fusion loss proposed by the loss proposal module. The three modules update alternately, enhancing each other to optimize the fusion loss for different tasks and consistently achieve satisfactory results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReFusion is capable of adapting to various tasks, including infrared-visible, medical, multi-focus, and multi-exposure image fusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The remarkable progress of deep learning in dermatological tasks has brought us closer to achieving diagnostic accuracies comparable to those of human experts. However, while large datasets play a crucial role in the development of reliable deep neural network models, the quality of data therein and their correct usage are of paramount importance. Several factors can impact data quality, such as the presence of duplicates, data leakage across train-test partitions, mislabeled images, and the absence of a well-defined test partition. In this paper, we conduct meticulous analyses of three popular dermatological image datasets: DermaMNIST, its source HAM10000, and Fitzpatrick17k, uncovering these data quality issues, measure the effects of these problems on the benchmark results, and propose corrections to the datasets. Besides ensuring the reproducibility of our analysis, by making our analysis pipeline and the accompanying code publicly available, we aim to encourage similar explorations and to facilitate the identification and addressing of potential data quality issues in other large datasets.</description>

      <title>A comparison between humans and AI at recognizing objects in unusual poses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning is closing the gap with human vision on several object recognition benchmarks. Here we investigate this gap for challenging images where objects are seen in unusual poses. We find that humans excel at recognizing objects in such poses. In contrast, state-of-the-art deep networks for vision (EfficientNet, SWAG, ViT, SWIN, BEiT, ConvNext) and state-of-the-art large vision-language models (Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5, GPT-4) are systematically brittle on unusual poses, with the exception of Gemini showing excellent robustness in that condition. As we limit image exposure time, human performance degrades to the level of deep networks, suggesting that additional mental processes (requiring additional time) are necessary to identify objects in unusual poses. An analysis of error patterns of humans vs. networks reveals that even time-limited humans are dissimilar to feed-forward deep networks. In conclusion, our comparison reveals that humans and deep networks rely on different mechanisms for recognizing objects in unusual poses. Understanding the nature of the mental processes taking place during extra viewing time may be key to reproduce the robustness of human vision in silico.</description>

      <title>Advancing Generalizable Remote Physiological Measurement through the Integration of Explicit and Implicit Prior Knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a promising technology that captures physiological signals from face videos, with potential applications in medical health, emotional computing, and biosecurity recognition. The demand for rPPG tasks has expanded from demonstrating good performance on intra-dataset testing to cross-dataset testing (i.e., domain generalization). However, most existing methods have overlooked the prior knowledge of rPPG, resulting in poor generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that simultaneously utilizes explicit and implicit prior knowledge in the rPPG task. Specifically, we systematically analyze the causes of noise sources (e.g., different camera, lighting, skin types, and movement) across different domains and incorporate these prior knowledge into the network. Additionally, we leverage a two-branch network to disentangle the physiological feature distribution from noises through implicit label correlation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB cross-dataset evaluation but also generalizes well from RGB datasets to NIR datasets.

      <title>Beyond Pixels: Enhancing LIME with Hierarchical Features and Segmentation Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07733v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is a popular XAI framework for unraveling decision-making processes in vision machine-learning models. The technique utilizes image segmentation methods to identify fixed regions for calculating feature importance scores as explanations. Therefore, poor segmentation can weaken the explanation and reduce the importance of segments, ultimately affecting the overall clarity of interpretation. To address these challenges, we introduce the DSEG-LIME (Data-Driven Segmentation LIME) framework, featuring: i) a data-driven segmentation for human-recognized feature generation by foundation model integration, and ii) a user-steered granularity in the hierarchical segmentation procedure through composition. Our findings demonstrate that DSEG outperforms on several XAI metrics on pre-trained ImageNet models and improves the alignment of explanations with human-recognized concepts.

      <title>Invertible Diffusion Models for Compressed Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While deep neural networks (NN) significantly advance image compressed sensing (CS) by improving reconstruction quality, the necessity of training current CS NNs from scratch constrains their effectiveness and hampers rapid deployment. Although recent methods utilize pre-trained diffusion models for image reconstruction, they struggle with slow inference and restricted adaptability to CS. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes Invertible Diffusion Models (IDM), a novel efficient, end-to-end diffusion-based CS method. IDM repurposes a large-scale diffusion sampling process as a reconstruction model, and fine-tunes it end-to-end to recover original images directly from CS measurements, moving beyond the traditional paradigm of one-step noise estimation learning. To enable such memory-intensive end-to-end fine-tuning, we propose a novel two-level invertible design to transform both (1) multi-step sampling process and (2) noise estimation U-Net in each step into invertible networks. As a result, most intermediate features are cleared during training to reduce up to 93.8% GPU memory. In addition, we develop a set of lightweight modules to inject measurements into noise estimator to further facilitate reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that IDM outperforms existing state-of-the-art CS networks by up to 2.64dB in PSNR.

      <title>FusionMamba: Dynamic Feature Enhancement for Multimodal Image Fusion with Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal image fusion aims to integrate information from different imaging techniques to produce a comprehensive, detail-rich single image for downstream vision tasks. Existing methods based on local convolutional neural networks (CNNs) struggle to capture global features efficiently, while Transformer-based models are computationally expensive, although they excel at global modeling. Mamba addresses these limitations by leveraging selective structured state space models (S4) to effectively handle long-range dependencies while maintaining linear complexity. In this paper, we propose FusionMamba, a novel dynamic feature enhancement framework that aims to overcome the challenges faced by CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViTs) in computer vision tasks. The framework improves the visual state-space model Mamba by integrating dynamic convolution and channel attention mechanisms, which not only retains its powerful global feature modeling capability, but also greatly reduces redundancy and enhances the expressiveness of local features. In addition, we have developed a new module called the dynamic feature fusion module (DFFM). It combines the dynamic feature enhancement module (DFEM) for texture enhancement and disparity perception with the cross-modal fusion Mamba module (CMFM), which focuses on enhancing the inter-modal correlation while suppressing redundant information. Experiments show that FusionMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in a variety of multimodal image fusion tasks as well as downstream experiments, demonstrating its broad applicability and superiority.</description>

      <title>From Data Deluge to Data Curation: A Filtering-WoRA Paradigm for Efficient Text-based Person Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In text-based person search endeavors, data generation has emerged as a prevailing practice, addressing concerns over privacy preservation and the arduous task of manual annotation. Although the number of synthesized data can be infinite in theory, the scientific conundrum persists that how much generated data optimally fuels subsequent model training. We observe that only a subset of the data in these constructed datasets plays a decisive role. Therefore, we introduce a new Filtering-WoRA paradigm, which contains a filtering algorithm to identify this crucial data subset and WoRA (Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation) learning strategy for light fine-tuning. The filtering algorithm is based on the cross-modality relevance to remove the lots of coarse matching synthesis pairs. As the number of data decreases, we do not need to fine-tune the entire model. Therefore, we propose a WoRA learning strategy to efficiently update a minimal portion of model parameters. WoRA streamlines the learning process, enabling heightened efficiency in extracting knowledge from fewer, yet potent, data instances. Extensive experimentation validates the efficacy of pretraining, where our model achieves advanced and efficient retrieval performance on challenging real-world benchmarks. Notably, on the CUHK-PEDES dataset, we have achieved a competitive mAP of 67.02% while reducing model training time by 19.82%.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Point Cloud Registration: A Comprehensive Survey and Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point cloud registration involves determining a rigid transformation to align a source point cloud with a target point cloud. This alignment is fundamental in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise spatial correspondence is essential. Deep learning has greatly advanced point cloud registration by providing robust and efficient methods that address the limitations of traditional approaches, including sensitivity to noise, outliers, and initialization. However, a well-constructed taxonomy for these methods is still lacking, making it difficult to systematically classify and compare the various approaches. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey and taxonomy on deep learning-based point cloud registration (DL-PCR). We begin with a formal description of the point cloud registration problem, followed by an overview of the datasets, evaluation metrics, and loss functions commonly used in DL-PCR. Next, we categorize existing DL-PCR methods into supervised and unsupervised approaches, as they focus on significantly different key aspects. For supervised DL-PCR methods, we organize the discussion based on key aspects, including the registration procedure, optimization strategy, learning paradigm, network enhancement, and integration with traditional methods; For unsupervised DL-PCR methods, we classify them into correspondence-based and correspondence-free approaches, depending on whether they require explicit identification of point-to-point correspondences. To facilitate a more comprehensive and fair comparison, we conduct quantitative evaluations of all recent state-of-the-art approaches, using a unified training setting and consistent data partitioning strategy. Lastly, we highlight the open challenges and discuss potential directions for future study. A comprehensive collection is available at https://github.com/yxzhang15/PCR.</description>

      <title>LEAF: Unveiling Two Sides of the Same Coin in Semi-supervised Facial Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach to tackle the challenge of label scarcity in facial expression recognition (FER) task. However, current state-of-the-art methods primarily focus on one side of the coin, i.e., generating high-quality pseudo-labels, while overlooking the other side: enhancing expression-relevant representations. In this paper, we unveil both sides of the coin by proposing a unified framework termed hierarchicaL dEcoupling And Fusing (LEAF) to coordinate expression-relevant representations and pseudo-labels for semi-supervised FER. LEAF introduces a hierarchical expression-aware aggregation strategy that operates at three levels: semantic, instance, and category. (1) At the semantic and instance levels, LEAF decouples representations into expression-agnostic and expression-relevant components, and adaptively fuses them using learnable gating weights. (2) At the category level, LEAF assigns ambiguous pseudo-labels by decoupling predictions into positive and negative parts, and employs a consistency loss to ensure agreement between two augmented views of the same image. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that by unveiling and harmonizing both sides of the coin, LEAF outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised FER methods, effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data. Moreover, the proposed expression-aware aggregation strategy can be seamlessly integrated into existing semi-supervised frameworks, leading to significant performance gains.

      <title>SIMPLOT: Enhancing Chart Question Answering by Distilling Essentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, interpreting complex charts with logical reasoning has emerged as challenges due to the development of vision-language models. A prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) model has presented an end-to-end method that leverages the vision-language model to convert charts into table format utilizing Large Language Model (LLM) for reasoning. However, unlike natural images, charts contain a mix of essential and irrelevant information required for chart reasoning, and we discover that this characteristic can lower the performance of chart-to-table extraction. In this paper, we introduce SIMPLOT, a method designed to extract only the elements necessary for chart reasoning. The proposed method involves two steps: 1) training to mimic a simple plot that contains only the essential information from a complex chart for table extraction, followed by 2) performing reasoning based on the table. Our model enables accurate chart reasoning without the need for additional annotations or datasets, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through various experiments. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt mimicking how human interpret charts for more accurate reasoning. Our source code is available at https://github.com/sangwu99/Simplot.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Data-Efficient 3D Scene Understanding for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient data utilization is crucial for advancing 3D scene understanding in autonomous driving, where reliance on heavily human-annotated LiDAR point clouds challenges fully supervised methods. Addressing this, our study extends into semi-supervised learning for LiDAR semantic segmentation, leveraging the intrinsic spatial priors of driving scenes and multi-sensor complements to augment the efficacy of unlabeled datasets. We introduce LaserMix++, an evolved framework that integrates laser beam manipulations from disparate LiDAR scans and incorporates LiDAR-camera correspondences to further assist data-efficient learning. Our framework is tailored to enhance 3D scene consistency regularization by incorporating multi-modality, including 1) multi-modal LaserMix operation for fine-grained cross-sensor interactions; 2) camera-to-LiDAR feature distillation that enhances LiDAR feature learning; and 3) language-driven knowledge guidance generating auxiliary supervisions using open-vocabulary models. The versatility of LaserMix++ enables applications across LiDAR representations, establishing it as a universally applicable solution. Our framework is rigorously validated through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on popular driving perception datasets. Results demonstrate that LaserMix++ markedly outperforms fully supervised alternatives, achieving comparable accuracy with five times fewer annotations and significantly improving the supervised-only baselines. This substantial advancement underscores the potential of semi-supervised approaches in reducing the reliance on extensive labeled data in LiDAR-based 3D scene understanding systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has grown rapidly in recent years, among which AI-based image generation has gained widespread attention due to its efficient and imaginative image creation ability. However, AI-generated Images (AIGIs) may not satisfy human preferences due to their unique distortions, which highlights the necessity to understand and evaluate human preferences for AIGIs. To this end, in this paper, we first establish a novel Image Quality Assessment (IQA) database for AIGIs, termed AIGCIQA2023+, which provides human visual preference scores and detailed preference explanations from three perspectives including quality, authenticity, and correspondence. Then, based on the constructed AIGCIQA2023+ database, this paper presents a MINT-IQA model to evaluate and explain human preferences for AIGIs from Multi-perspectives with INstruction Tuning. Specifically, the MINT-IQA model first learn and evaluate human preferences for AI-generated Images from multi-perspectives, then via the vision-language instruction tuning strategy, MINT-IQA attains powerful understanding and explanation ability for human visual preference on AIGIs, which can be used for feedback to further improve the assessment capabilities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MINT-IQA model achieves state-of-the-art performance in understanding and evaluating human visual preferences for AIGIs, and the proposed model also achieves competing results on traditional IQA tasks compared with state-of-the-art IQA models. The AIGCIQA2023+ database and MINT-IQA model are available at: https://github.com/IntMeGroup/MINT-IQA.</description>

      <title>VTG-LLM: Integrating Timestamp Knowledge into Video LLMs for Enhanced Video Temporal Grounding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) strives to accurately pinpoint event timestamps in a specific video using linguistic queries, significantly impacting downstream tasks like video browsing and editing. Unlike traditional task-specific models, Video Large Language Models (video LLMs) can handle multiple tasks concurrently in a zero-shot manner. Consequently, exploring the application of video LLMs for VTG tasks has become a burgeoning research area. However, despite considerable advancements in video content understanding, video LLMs often struggle to accurately pinpoint timestamps within videos, limiting their effectiveness in VTG tasks. To address this, we introduce VTG-LLM, a model designed to enhance video LLMs' timestamp localization abilities. Our approach includes: (1) effectively integrating timestamp knowledge into visual tokens; (2) incorporating absolute-time tokens to manage timestamp knowledge without concept shifts; and (3) introducing a lightweight, high-performance, slot-based token compression technique designed to accommodate the demands of a large number of frames to be sampled for VTG tasks. Additionally, we present VTG-IT-120K, a collection of publicly available VTG datasets that we have re-annotated to improve upon low-quality annotations. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of VTG-LLM in comparison to other video LLM methods across a variety of VTG tasks.</description>

      <title>Robust Hyperbolic Learning with Curvature-Aware Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperbolic deep learning has become a growing research direction in computer vision due to the unique properties afforded by the alternate embedding space. The negative curvature and exponentially growing distance metric provide a natural framework for capturing hierarchical relationships between datapoints and allowing for finer separability between their embeddings. However, current hyperbolic learning approaches are still prone to overfitting, computationally expensive, and prone to instability, especially when attempting to learn the manifold curvature to adapt to tasks and different datasets. To address these issues, our paper presents a derivation for Riemannian AdamW that helps increase hyperbolic generalization ability. For improved stability, we introduce a novel fine-tunable hyperbolic scaling approach to constrain hyperbolic embeddings and reduce approximation errors. Using this along with our curvature-aware learning schema for Lorentzian Optimizers enables the combination of curvature and non-trivialized hyperbolic parameter learning. Our approach demonstrates consistent performance improvements across Computer Vision, EEG classification, and hierarchical metric learning tasks achieving state-of-the-art results in two domains and drastically reducing runtime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in bird's eye view (BEV) representations have shown remarkable promise for in-vehicle 3D perception. However, while these methods have achieved impressive results on standard benchmarks, their robustness in varied conditions remains insufficiently assessed. In this study, we present RoboBEV, an extensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate the resilience of BEV algorithms. This suite incorporates a diverse set of camera corruption types, each examined over three severity levels. Our benchmarks also consider the impact of complete sensor failures that occur when using multi-modal models. Through RoboBEV, we assess 33 state-of-the-art BEV-based perception models spanning tasks like detection, map segmentation, depth estimation, and occupancy prediction. Our analyses reveal a noticeable correlation between the model's performance on in-distribution datasets and its resilience to out-of-distribution challenges. Our experimental results also underline the efficacy of strategies like pre-training and depth-free BEV transformations in enhancing robustness against out-of-distribution data. Furthermore, we observe that leveraging extensive temporal information significantly improves the model's robustness. Based on our observations, we design an effective robustness enhancement strategy based on the CLIP model. The insights from this study pave the way for the development of future BEV models that seamlessly combine accuracy with real-world robustness.</description>

      <title>Optimal compressed sensing for image reconstruction with diffusion probabilistic models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the problem of selecting a small set of linear measurements for reconstructing high-dimensional signals. Well-established methods for optimizing such measurements include principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA) and compressed sensing (CS) based on random projections, all of which rely on axis- or subspace-aligned statistical characterization of the signal source. However, many naturally occurring signals, including photographic images, contain richer statistical structure. To exploit such structure, we introduce a general method for obtaining an optimized set of linear measurements for efficient image reconstruction, where the signal statistics are expressed by the prior implicit in a neural network trained to perform denoising (generally known as a "diffusion model"). We demonstrate that the optimal measurements derived for two natural image datasets differ from those of PCA, ICA, or CS, and result in substantially lower mean squared reconstruction error. Interestingly, the marginal distributions of the measurement values are asymmetrical (skewed), substantially more so than those of previous methods. We also find that optimizing with respect to perceptual loss, as quantified by structural similarity (SSIM), leads to measurements different from those obtained when optimizing for MSE. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating the specific statistical regularities of natural signals when designing effective linear measurements.</description>

      <title>EffoVPR: Effective Foundation Model Utilization for Visual Place Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is to predict the location of a query image from a database of geo-tagged images. Recent studies in VPR have highlighted the significant advantage of employing pre-trained foundation models like DINOv2 for the VPR task. However, these models are often deemed inadequate for VPR without further fine-tuning on VPR-specific data. In this paper, we present an effective approach to harness the potential of a foundation model for VPR. We show that features extracted from self-attention layers can act as a powerful re-ranker for VPR, even in a zero-shot setting. Our method not only outperforms previous zero-shot approaches but also introduces results competitive with several supervised methods. We then show that a single-stage approach utilizing internal ViT layers for pooling can produce global features that achieve state-of-the-art performance, with impressive feature compactness down to 128D. Moreover, integrating our local foundation features for re-ranking further widens this performance gap. Our method also demonstrates exceptional robustness and generalization, setting new state-of-the-art performance, while handling challenging conditions such as occlusion, day-night transitions, and seasonal variations.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Video Restoration and Enhancement Using Pre-Trained Image Diffusion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01960v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion-based zero-shot image restoration and enhancement models have achieved great success in various tasks of image restoration and enhancement. However, directly applying them to video restoration and enhancement results in severe temporal flickering artifacts. In this paper, we propose the first framework for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement based on the pre-trained image diffusion model. By replacing the spatial self-attention layer with the proposed short-long-range (SLR) temporal attention layer, the pre-trained image diffusion model can take advantage of the temporal correlation between frames. We further propose temporal consistency guidance, spatial-temporal noise sharing, and an early stopping sampling strategy to improve temporally consistent sampling. Our method is a plug-and-play module that can be inserted into any diffusion-based image restoration or enhancement methods to further improve their performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/cao-cong/ZVRD.</description>

Abstract: Hand shadow puppetry, also known as shadowgraphy or ombromanie, is a form of theatrical art and storytelling where hand shadows are projected onto flat surfaces to create illusions of living creatures. The skilled performers create these silhouettes by hand positioning, finger movements, and dexterous gestures to resemble shadows of animals and objects. Due to the lack of practitioners and a seismic shift in people's entertainment standards, this art form is on the verge of extinction. To facilitate its preservation and proliferate it to a wider audience, we introduce ${\rm H{\small A}SP{\small E}R}$, a novel dataset consisting of 15,000 images of hand shadow puppets across 15 classes extracted from both professional and amateur hand shadow puppeteer clips. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and employ a range of pretrained image classification models to establish baselines. Our findings show a substantial performance superiority of skip-connected convolutional models over attention-based transformer architectures. We also find that lightweight models, such as MobileNetV2, suited for mobile applications and embedded devices, perform comparatively well. We surmise that such low-latency architectures can be useful in developing ombromanie teaching tools, and we create a prototype application to explore this surmission. Keeping the best-performing model ResNet34 under the limelight, we conduct comprehensive feature-spatial, explainability, and error analyses to gain insights into its decision-making process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented dataset and research endeavor to preserve this dying art for future generations, with computer vision approaches. Our code and data will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Sampling Protocol for Point Cloud Classification Against Corruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Established sampling protocols for 3D point cloud learning, such as Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) and Fixed Sample Size (FSS), have long been relied upon. However, real-world data often suffer from corruptions, such as sensor noise, which violates the benign data assumption in current protocols. As a result, these protocols are highly vulnerable to noise, posing significant safety risks in critical applications like autonomous driving. To address these issues, we propose an enhanced point cloud sampling protocol, PointSP, designed to improve robustness against point cloud corruptions. PointSP incorporates key point reweighting to mitigate outlier sensitivity and ensure the selection of representative points. It also introduces a local-global balanced downsampling strategy, which allows for scalable and adaptive sampling while maintaining geometric consistency. Additionally, a lightweight tangent plane interpolation method is used to preserve local geometry while enhancing the density of the point cloud. Unlike learning-based approaches that require additional model training, PointSP is architecture-agnostic, requiring no extra learning or modification to the network. This enables seamless integration into existing pipelines. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world corrupted datasets show that PointSP significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of point cloud classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.</description>

      <title>RSTeller: Scaling Up Visual Language Modeling in Remote Sensing with Rich Linguistic Semantics from Openly Available Data and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abundant, well-annotated multimodal data in remote sensing are pivotal for aligning complex visual remote sensing (RS) scenes with human language, enabling the development of specialized vision language models across diverse RS interpretation tasks. However, annotating RS images with rich linguistic semantics at scale demands expertise in RS and substantial human labor, making it costly and often impractical. In this study, we propose a workflow that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate multimodal datasets with semantically rich captions at scale from plain OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for images sourced from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This approach facilitates the generation of paired remote sensing data and can be readily scaled up using openly available data. Within this framework, we present RSTeller, a multimodal dataset comprising over 1.3 million RS images, each accompanied by two descriptive captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSTeller enhances the performance of multiple existing vision language models for RS scene understanding through continual pre-training. Our methodology significantly reduces the manual effort and expertise needed for annotating remote sensing imagery while democratizing access to high-quality annotated data. This advancement fosters progress in visual language modeling and encourages broader participation in remote sensing research and applications. The RSTeller dataset is available at https://github.com/SlytherinGe/RSTeller.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Multimodal 3D Medical Image Registration with Multilevel Correlation Balanced Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surgical navigation based on multimodal image registration has played a significant role in providing intraoperative guidance to surgeons by showing the relative position of the target area to critical anatomical structures during surgery. However, due to the differences between multimodal images and intraoperative image deformation caused by tissue displacement and removal during surgery, effective registration of preoperative and intraoperative multimodal images faces significant challenges. To address the multimodal image registration challenges in Learn2Reg 2024, an unsupervised multimodal medical image registration method based on multilevel correlation balanced optimization (MCBO) is designed to solve these problems. First, the features of each modality are extracted based on the modality independent neighborhood descriptor, and the multimodal images are mapped to the feature space. Second, a multilevel pyramidal fusion optimization mechanism is designed to achieve global optimization and local detail complementation of the deformation field through dense correlation analysis and weight-balanced coupled convex optimization for input features at different scales. For preoperative medical images in different modalities, the alignment and stacking of valid information between different modalities is achieved by the maximum fusion between deformation fields. Our method focuses on the ReMIND2Reg task in Learn2Reg 2024, and to verify the generality of the method, we also tested it on the COMULIS3DCLEM task. Based on the results, our method achieved second place in the validation of both two tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/wjiazheng/MCBO.</description>

      <title>Learning to Compress Contexts for Efficient Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated great performance on visual question answering (VQA). When it comes to knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA), MLLMs may lack the specialized domain knowledge needed to answer questions, necessitating the retrieval of necessary information from external knowledge sources. Previous works like Retrival-Augmented VQA-v2 (RAVQA-v2) focus on utilizing as much input information, such as image-based textual descriptions and retrieved knowledge, as possible to improve performance, but they all overlook the issue that with the number of input tokens increasing, inference efficiency significantly decreases, which contradicts the demands of practical applications. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{R}etrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented MLLMs with Compressed Contexts (RACC). RACC learns to compress and aggregate retrieved knowledge for a given image-question pair, generating a compact modulation in the form of Key-Value (KV) cache to adapt the downstream frozen MLLM, thereby achieving effective and efficient inference. RACC achieves a state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of 63.92\% on OK-VQA. Moreover, it significantly reduces inference latency by 22.0\%-59.7\% compared to the prominent RAVQA-v2. Abundant experiments show RACC's broad applicability. It is compatible with various off-the-shelf MLLMs and can also handle different knowledge sources including textual and multimodal documents.</description>

      <title>Style-based Clustering of Visual Artworks and the Play of Neural Style-Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering artworks based on style can have many potential real-world applications like art recommendations, style-based search and retrieval, and the study of artistic style evolution of an artist or in an artwork corpus. We introduce and deliberate over the notion of 'Style-based clustering of visual artworks'. We argue that clustering artworks based on style is largely an unaddressed problem. We explore and devise different neural feature representations - from the style-classification, style-transfer to large language vision models - that can be then used for style-based clustering. Our objective is to assess the relative effectiveness of these devised style-based clustering approaches through qualitative and quantitative analysis by applying them to multiple artwork corpora and curated synthetically styled datasets. Besides providing a broad framework for style-based clustering and evaluation, our analysis provides some key novel insights on feature representations, architectures and implications for style-based clustering.</description>

      <title>Disentanglement with Factor Quantized Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disentangled representation learning aims to represent the underlying generative factors of a dataset in a latent representation independently of one another. In our work, we propose a discrete variational autoencoder (VAE) based model where the ground truth information about the generative factors are not provided to the model. We demonstrate the advantages of learning discrete representations over learning continuous representations in facilitating disentanglement. Furthermore, we propose incorporating an inductive bias into the model to further enhance disentanglement. Precisely, we propose scalar quantization of the latent variables in a latent representation with scalar values from a global codebook, and we add a total correlation term to the optimization as an inductive bias. Our method called FactorQVAE combines optimization based disentanglement approaches with discrete representation learning, and it outperforms the former disentanglement methods in terms of two disentanglement metrics (DCI and InfoMEC) while improving the reconstruction performance. Our code can be found at https://github.com/ituvisionlab/FactorQVAE.</description>

      <title>VisioPhysioENet: Multimodal Engagement Detection using Visual and Physiological Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents VisioPhysioENet, a novel multimodal system that leverages visual and physiological signals to detect learner engagement. It employs a two-level approach for extracting both visual and physiological features. For visual feature extraction, Dlib is used to detect facial landmarks, while OpenCV provides additional estimations. The face recognition library, built on Dlib, is used to identify the facial region of interest specifically for physiological signal extraction. Physiological signals are then extracted using the plane-orthogonal-toskin method to assess cardiovascular activity. These features are integrated using advanced machine learning classifiers, enhancing the detection of various levels of engagement. We thoroughly tested VisioPhysioENet on the DAiSEE dataset. It achieved an accuracy of 63.09%. This shows it can better identify different levels of engagement compared to many existing methods. It performed 8.6% better than the only other model that uses both physiological and visual features.</description>

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is a critical task for autonomous driving and many other computer vision applications. While significant progress has been made in this field, the effects of viewpoint shifts on depth estimation models remain largely underexplored. This paper introduces a novel dataset and evaluation methodology to quantify the impact of different camera positions and orientations on monocular depth estimation performance. We propose a ground truth strategy based on homography estimation and object detection, eliminating the need for expensive LIDAR sensors. We collect a diverse dataset of road scenes from multiple viewpoints and use it to assess the robustness of a modern depth estimation model to geometric shifts. After assessing the validity of our strategy on a public dataset, we provide valuable insights into the limitations of current models and highlight the importance of considering viewpoint variations in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>LLaVA-3D: A Simple yet Effective Pathway to Empowering LMMs with 3D-awareness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have greatly enhanced their proficiency in 2D visual understanding tasks, enabling them to effectively process and understand images and videos. However, the development of LMMs with 3D-awareness for 3D scene understanding has been hindered by the lack of large-scale 3D vision-language datasets and powerful 3D encoders. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective framework called LLaVA-3D. Leveraging the strong 2D understanding priors from LLaVA, our LLaVA-3D efficiently adapts LLaVA for 3D scene understanding without compromising 2D understanding capabilities. To achieve this, we utilize the 3D position embeddings to bring the 2D CLIP patches within a 3D spatial context. By integrating the 3D position embeddings into 2D LMMs and employing joint 2D and 3D vision-language instruction tuning, we establish a unified architecture for both 2D image understanding and 3D scene understanding. Experimental results show that LLaVA-3D converges 3.5x faster than existing 3D LMMs when trained on 3D vision-language datasets. Moreover, LLaVA-3D not only achieves state-of-the-art performance across various 3D tasks but also maintains comparable 2D image understanding and vision-language conversation capabilities with LLaVA.</description>

      <title>OmniSR: Shadow Removal under Direct and Indirect Lighting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shadows can originate from occlusions in both direct and indirect illumination. Although most current shadow removal research focuses on shadows caused by direct illumination, shadows from indirect illumination are often just as pervasive, particularly in indoor scenes. A significant challenge in removing shadows from indirect illumination is obtaining shadow-free images to train the shadow removal network. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel rendering pipeline for generating shadowed and shadow-free images under direct and indirect illumination, and create a comprehensive synthetic dataset that contains over 30,000 image pairs, covering various object types and lighting conditions. We also propose an innovative shadow removal network that explicitly integrates semantic and geometric priors through concatenation and attention mechanisms. The experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art shadow removal techniques and can effectively generalize to indoor and outdoor scenes under various lighting conditions, enhancing the overall effectiveness and applicability of shadow removal methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orientation estimation is a fundamental task in 3D shape analysis which consists of estimating a shape's orientation axes: its side-, up-, and front-axes. Using this data, one can rotate a shape into canonical orientation, where its orientation axes are aligned with the coordinate axes. Developing an orientation algorithm that reliably estimates complete orientations of general shapes remains an open problem. We introduce a two-stage orientation pipeline that achieves state of the art performance on up-axis estimation and further demonstrate its efficacy on full-orientation estimation, where one seeks all three orientation axes. Unlike previous work, we train and evaluate our method on all of Shapenet rather than a subset of classes. We motivate our engineering contributions by theory describing fundamental obstacles to orientation estimation for rotationally-symmetric shapes, and show how our method avoids these obstacles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of image editing, three core challenges persist: controllability, background preservation, and efficiency. Inversion-based methods rely on time-consuming optimization to preserve the features of the initial images, which results in low efficiency due to the requirement for extensive network inference. Conversely, inversion-free methods lack theoretical support for background similarity, as they circumvent the issue of maintaining initial features to achieve efficiency. As a consequence, none of these methods can achieve both high efficiency and background consistency. To tackle the challenges and the aforementioned disadvantages, we introduce PostEdit, a method that incorporates a posterior scheme to govern the diffusion sampling process. Specifically, a corresponding measurement term related to both the initial features and Langevin dynamics is introduced to optimize the estimated image generated by the given target prompt. Extensive experimental results indicate that the proposed PostEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance while accurately preserving unedited regions. Furthermore, the method is both inversion- and training-free, necessitating approximately 1.5 seconds and 18 GB of GPU memory to generate high-quality results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, leveraging powerful pre trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) backends, have shown promise in robotic control due to their impressive generalization ability. However, the success comes at a cost. Their reliance on VLM backends with billions of parameters leads to high computational costs and inference latency, limiting the testing scenarios to mainly quasi-static tasks and hindering performance in dynamic tasks requiring rapid interactions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes HiRT, a Hierarchical Robot Transformer framework that enables flexible frequency and performance trade-off. HiRT keeps VLMs running at low frequencies to capture temporarily invariant features while enabling real-time interaction through a high-frequency vision-based policy guided by the slowly updated features. Experiment results in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods. Empirically, in static tasks, we double the control frequency and achieve comparable success rates. Additionally, on novel real-world dynamic ma nipulation tasks which are challenging for previous VLA models, HiRT improves the success rate from 48% to 75%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces TinyEmo, a family of small multi-modal language models for emotional reasoning and classification. Our approach features: (1) a synthetic emotional instruct dataset for both pre-training and fine-tuning stages, (2) a Metric Projector that delegates classification from the language model allowing for more efficient training and inference, (3) a multi-modal large language model (MM-LLM) for emotional reasoning, and (4) a semi-automated framework for bias detection. TinyEmo is able to perform emotion classification and emotional reasoning, all while using substantially fewer parameters than comparable models. This efficiency allows us to freely incorporate more diverse emotional datasets, enabling strong performance on classification tasks, with our smallest model (700M parameters) outperforming larger state-of-the-art models based on general-purpose MM-LLMs with over 7B parameters. Additionally, the Metric Projector allows for interpretability and indirect bias detection in large models without additional training, offering an approach to understand and improve AI systems.

      <title>Improving Vision Transformers by Overlapping Heads in Multi-Head Self-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision Transformers have made remarkable progress in recent years, achieving state-of-the-art performance in most vision tasks. A key component of this success is due to the introduction of the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) module, which enables each head to learn different representations by applying the attention mechanism independently. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that Vision Transformers can be further enhanced by overlapping the heads in MHSA. We introduce Multi-Overlapped-Head Self-Attention (MOHSA), where heads are overlapped with their two adjacent heads for queries, keys, and values, while zero-padding is employed for the first and last heads, which have only one neighboring head. Various paradigms for overlapping ratios are proposed to fully investigate the optimal performance of our approach. The proposed approach is evaluated using five Transformer models on four benchmark datasets and yields a significant performance boost. The source code will be made publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>Your Image is Secretly the Last Frame of a Pseudo Video</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models, which can be viewed as a special case of hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), have shown profound success in generating photo-realistic images. In contrast, standard HVAEs often produce images of inferior quality compared to diffusion models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the success of diffusion models can be partly attributed to the additional self-supervision information for their intermediate latent states provided by corrupted images, which along with the original image form a pseudo video. Based on this hypothesis, we explore the possibility of improving other types of generative models with such pseudo videos. Specifically, we first extend a given image generative model to their video generative model counterpart, and then train the video generative model on pseudo videos constructed by applying data augmentation to the original images. Furthermore, we analyze the potential issues of first-order Markov data augmentation methods, which are typically used in diffusion models, and propose to use more expressive data augmentation to construct more useful information in pseudo videos. Our empirical results on the CIFAR10 and CelebA datasets demonstrate that improved image generation quality can be achieved with additional self-supervised information from pseudo videos.</description>

      <title>AutoBench-V: Can Large Vision-Language Models Benchmark Themselves?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have become essential for advancing the integration of visual and linguistic information. However, the evaluation of LVLMs presents significant challenges as the evaluation benchmark always demands lots of human cost for its construction, and remains static, lacking flexibility once constructed. Even though automatic evaluation has been explored in textual modality, the visual modality remains under-explored. As a result, in this work, we address a question: "Can LVLMs themselves be used to benchmark each other in the visual automatically domain?". We introduce AutoBench-V, an automated framework for serving evaluation on demand, i.e., benchmarking LVLMs based on specific aspects of model capability. AutoBench-V leverages text-to-image models to generate relevant image samples and then utilizes LVLMs to orchestrate visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, completing the evaluation process efficiently and flexibly. Through an extensive evaluation of nine popular LVLMs across five demanded user inputs (i.e., evaluation capabilities), the framework shows effectiveness and reliability.</description>

      <title>RSNet: A Light Framework for The Detection of Multi-scale Remote Sensing Targets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23073v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ship detection using deep learning have significantly improved accuracy and speed, yet effectively detecting small objects in complex backgrounds with fewer parameters remains a challenge. This letter introduces RSNet, a lightweight framework constructed to enhance ship detection in SAR imagery. To ensure accuracy with fewer parameters, we proposed Waveletpool-ContextGuided (WCG) as its backbone, guiding global context understanding through multi-scale wavelet features for effective detection in complex scenes. Additionally, Waveletpool-StarFusion (WSF) is introduced as the neck, employing a residual wavelet element-wise multiplication structure to achieve higher dimensional nonlinear features without increasing network width. The Lightweight-Shared (LS) module is designed as detect components to achieve efficient detection through lightweight shared convolutional structure and multi-format compatibility. Experiments on the SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) and High-Resolution SAR Image Dataset (HRSID) demonstrate that RSNet achieves a strong balance between lightweight design and detection performance, surpassing many state-of-the-art detectors, reaching 72.5\% and 67.6\% in \textbf{\(\mathbf{mAP_{.50:.95}}\) }respectively with 1.49M parameters. Our code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Scale-Aware Recognition in Satellite Images under Resource Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recognition of features in satellite imagery (forests, swimming pools, etc.) depends strongly on the spatial scale of the concept and therefore the resolution of the images. This poses two challenges: Which resolution is best suited for recognizing a given concept, and where and when should the costlier higher-resolution (HR) imagery be acquired?
  We present a novel scheme to address these challenges by introducing three components: (1) A technique to distill knowledge from models trained on HR imagery to recognition models that operate on imagery of lower resolution (LR), (2) a sampling strategy for HR imagery based on model disagreement, and (3) an LLM-based approach for inferring concept "scale". With these components we present a system to efficiently perform scale-aware recognition in satellite imagery, improving accuracy over single-scale inference while following budget constraints. Our novel approach offers up to a 26.3% improvement over entirely HR baselines, using 76.3% fewer HR images.</description>

      <title>A New Logic For Pediatric Brain Tumor Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach for segmenting pediatric brain tumors using a deep learning architecture, inspired by expert radiologists' segmentation strategies. Our model delineates four distinct tumor labels and is benchmarked on a held-out PED BraTS 2024 test set (i.e., pediatric brain tumor datasets introduced by BraTS). Furthermore, we evaluate our model's performance against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model using a new external dataset of 30 patients from CBTN (Children's Brain Tumor Network), labeled in accordance with the PED BraTS 2024 guidelines and 2023 BraTS Adult Glioma dataset. We compare segmentation outcomes with the winning algorithm from the PED BraTS 2023 challenge as the SOTA model. Our proposed algorithm achieved an average Dice score of 0.642 and an HD95 of 73.0 mm on the CBTN test data, outperforming the SOTA model, which achieved a Dice score of 0.626 and an HD95 of 84.0 mm. Moreover, our model exhibits strong generalizability, attaining a 0.877 Dice score in whole tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2023 Adult Glioma dataset, surpassing existing SOTA. Our results indicate that the proposed model is a step towards providing more accurate segmentation for pediatric brain tumors, which is essential for evaluating therapy response and monitoring patient progress.</description>

      <title>VideoGLaMM: A Large Multimodal Model for Pixel-Level Visual Grounding in Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-grained alignment between videos and text is challenging due to complex spatial and temporal dynamics in videos. Existing video-based Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) handle basic conversations but struggle with precise pixel-level grounding in videos. To address this, we introduce VideoGLaMM, a LMM designed for fine-grained pixel-level grounding in videos based on user-provided textual inputs. Our design seamlessly connects three key components: a Large Language Model, a dual vision encoder that emphasizes both spatial and temporal details, and a spatio-temporal decoder for accurate mask generation. This connection is facilitated via tunable V-L and L-V adapters that enable close Vision-Language (VL) alignment. The architecture is trained to synchronize both spatial and temporal elements of video content with textual instructions. To enable fine-grained grounding, we curate a multimodal dataset featuring detailed visually-grounded conversations using a semiautomatic annotation pipeline, resulting in a diverse set of 38k video-QA triplets along with 83k objects and 671k masks. We evaluate VideoGLaMM on three challenging tasks: Grounded Conversation Generation, Visual Grounding, and Referring Video Segmentation. Experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms existing approaches across all three tasks.</description>

      <title>Methodology for a Statistical Analysis of Influencing Factors on 3D Object Detection Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In automated driving, object detection is an essential task to perceive the environment by localizing and classifying objects. Most object detection algorithms are based on deep learning for superior performance. However, their black-box nature makes it challenging to ensure safety. In this paper, we propose a first-of-its-kind methodology for analyzing the influence of various factors related to the objects or the environment on the detection performance of both LiDAR- and camera-based 3D object detectors. We conduct a statistical univariate analysis between each factor and the detection error on pedestrians to compare their strength of influence. In addition to univariate analysis, we employ a Random Forest (RF) model to predict the errors of specific detectors based on the provided meta-information. To interpret the predictions of the RF and assess the importance of individual features, we compute Shapley Values. By considering feature dependencies, the RF captures more complex relationships between meta-information and detection errors, allowing a more nuanced analysis of the factors contributing to the observed errors. Recognizing the factors that influence detection performance helps identify performance insufficiencies in the trained object detector and supports the safe development of object detection systems.</description>

      <title>GIFT: A Framework for Global Interpretable Faithful Textual Explanations of Vision Classifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding deep models is crucial for deploying them in safety-critical applications. We introduce GIFT, a framework for deriving post-hoc, global, interpretable, and faithful textual explanations for vision classifiers. GIFT starts from local faithful visual counterfactual explanations and employs (vision) language models to translate those into global textual explanations. Crucially, GIFT provides a verification stage measuring the causal effect of the proposed explanations on the classifier decision. Through experiments across diverse datasets, including CLEVR, CelebA, and BDD, we demonstrate that GIFT effectively reveals meaningful insights, uncovering tasks, concepts, and biases used by deep vision classifiers. The framework is released at https://github.com/valeoai/GIFT.</description>

      <title>Gaussians on their Way: Wasserstein-Constrained 4D Gaussian Splatting with State-Space Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic scene rendering has taken a leap forward with the rise of 4D Gaussian Splatting, but there's still one elusive challenge: how to make 3D Gaussians move through time as naturally as they would in the real world, all while keeping the motion smooth and consistent. In this paper, we unveil a fresh approach that blends state-space modeling with Wasserstein geometry, paving the way for a more fluid and coherent representation of dynamic scenes. We introduce a State Consistency Filter that merges prior predictions with the current observations, enabling Gaussians to stay true to their way over time. We also employ Wasserstein distance regularization to ensure smooth, consistent updates of Gaussian parameters, reducing motion artifacts. Lastly, we leverage Wasserstein geometry to capture both translational motion and shape deformations, creating a more physically plausible model for dynamic scenes. Our approach guides Gaussians along their natural way in the Wasserstein space, achieving smoother, more realistic motion and stronger temporal coherence. Experimental results show significant improvements in rendering quality and efficiency, outperforming current state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counting is a fundamental operation for various visual tasks in real-life applications, requiring both object recognition and robust counting capabilities. Despite their advanced visual perception, large vision-language models (LVLMs) struggle with counting tasks, especially when the number of objects exceeds those commonly encountered during training. We enhance LVLMs' counting abilities using a divide-and-conquer approach, breaking counting problems into sub-counting tasks. Our method employs a mechanism that prevents bisecting and thus repetitive counting of objects, which occurs in a naive divide-and-conquer approach. Unlike prior methods, which do not generalize well to counting datasets they have not been trained on, our method performs well on new datasets without any additional training or fine-tuning. We demonstrate that our approach enhances the counting capability of LVLMs across various datasets and benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: Models for egocentric 3D and 4D reconstruction, including few-shot interpolation and extrapolation settings, can benefit from having images from exocentric viewpoints as supervision signals. No existing dataset provides the necessary mixture of complex, dynamic, and multi-view data. To facilitate the development of 3D and 4D reconstruction methods in the autonomous driving context, we propose a Synthetic Ego--Exo Dynamic 4D (SEED4D) data generator and dataset. We present a customizable, easy-to-use data generator for spatio-temporal multi-view data creation. Our open-source data generator allows the creation of synthetic data for camera setups commonly used in the NuScenes, KITTI360, and Waymo datasets. Additionally, SEED4D encompasses two large-scale multi-view synthetic urban scene datasets. Our static (3D) dataset encompasses 212k inward- and outward-facing vehicle images from 2k scenes, while our dynamic (4D) dataset contains 16.8M images from 10k trajectories, each sampled at 100 points in time with egocentric images, exocentric images, and LiDAR data. The datasets and the data generator can be found at https://seed4d.github.io/.</description>

      <title>LSceneLLM: Enhancing Large 3D Scene Understanding Using Adaptive Visual Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on 3D Vision-Language Models (3D-VLMs) is gaining increasing attention, which is crucial for developing embodied AI within 3D scenes, such as visual navigation and embodied question answering. Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.</description>

      <title>Prithvi-EO-2.0: A Versatile Multi-Temporal Foundation Model for Earth Observation Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This technical report presents Prithvi-EO-2.0, a new geospatial foundation model that offers significant improvements over its predecessor, Prithvi-EO-1.0. Trained on 4.2M global time series samples from NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 data archive at 30m resolution, the new 300M and 600M parameter models incorporate temporal and location embeddings for enhanced performance across various geospatial tasks. Through extensive benchmarking with GEO-Bench, the 600M version outperforms the previous Prithvi-EO model by 8\% across a range of tasks. It also outperforms six other geospatial foundation models when benchmarked on remote sensing tasks from different domains and resolutions (i.e. from 0.1m to 15m). The results demonstrate the versatility of the model in both classical earth observation and high-resolution applications. Early involvement of end-users and subject matter experts (SMEs) are among the key factors that contributed to the project's success. In particular, SME involvement allowed for constant feedback on model and dataset design, as well as successful customization for diverse SME-led applications in disaster response, land use and crop mapping, and ecosystem dynamics monitoring. Prithvi-EO-2.0 is available on Hugging Face and IBM terratorch, with additional resources on GitHub. The project exemplifies the Trusted Open Science approach embraced by all involved organizations.</description>

Abstract: As the quality of image generators continues to improve, deepfakes become a topic of considerable societal debate. Image watermarking allows responsible model owners to detect and label their AI-generated content, which can mitigate the harm. Yet, current state-of-the-art methods in image watermarking remain vulnerable to forgery and removal attacks. This vulnerability occurs in part because watermarks distort the distribution of generated images, unintentionally revealing information about the watermarking techniques.
  In this work, we first demonstrate a distortion-free watermarking method for images, based on a diffusion model's initial noise. However, detecting the watermark requires comparing the initial noise reconstructed for an image to all previously used initial noises. To mitigate these issues, we propose a two-stage watermarking framework for efficient detection. During generation, we augment the initial noise with generated Fourier patterns to embed information about the group of initial noises we used. For detection, we (i) retrieve the relevant group of noises, and (ii) search within the given group for an initial noise that might match our image. This watermarking approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness to forgery and removal against a large battery of attacks.</description>

      <title>RFL: Simplifying Chemical Structure Recognition with Ring-Free Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary objective of Optical Chemical Structure Recognition is to identify chemical structure images into corresponding markup sequences. However, the complex two-dimensional structures of molecules, particularly those with rings and multiple branches, present significant challenges for current end-to-end methods to learn one-dimensional markup directly. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Ring-Free Language (RFL), which utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy to describe chemical structures in a hierarchical form. RFL allows complex molecular structures to be decomposed into multiple parts, ensuring both uniqueness and conciseness while enhancing readability. This approach significantly reduces the learning difficulty for recognition models. Leveraging RFL, we propose a universal Molecular Skeleton Decoder (MSD), which comprises a skeleton generation module that progressively predicts the molecular skeleton and individual rings, along with a branch classification module for predicting branch information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RFL and MSD can be applied to various mainstream methods, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches in both printed and handwritten scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/JingMog/RFL-MSD.</description>

      <title>Motif Guided Graph Transformer with Combinatorial Skeleton Prototype Learning for Skeleton-Based Person Re-Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Person re-identification (re-ID) via 3D skeleton data is a challenging task with significant value in many scenarios. Existing skeleton-based methods typically assume virtual motion relations between all joints, and adopt average joint or sequence representations for learning. However, they rarely explore key body structure and motion such as gait to focus on more important body joints or limbs, while lacking the ability to fully mine valuable spatial-temporal sub-patterns of skeletons to enhance model learning. This paper presents a generic Motif guided graph transformer with Combinatorial skeleton prototype learning (MoCos) that exploits structure-specific and gait-related body relations as well as combinatorial features of skeleton graphs to learn effective skeleton representations for person re-ID. In particular, motivated by the locality within joints' structure and the body-component collaboration in gait, we first propose the motif guided graph transformer (MGT) that incorporates hierarchical structural motifs and gait collaborative motifs, which simultaneously focuses on multi-order local joint correlations and key cooperative body parts to enhance skeleton relation learning. Then, we devise the combinatorial skeleton prototype learning (CSP) that leverages random spatial-temporal combinations of joint nodes and skeleton graphs to generate diverse sub-skeleton and sub-tracklet representations, which are contrasted with the most representative features (prototypes) of each identity to learn class-related semantics and discriminative skeleton representations. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of MoCos over existing state-of-the-art models. We further show its generality under RGB-estimated skeletons, different graph modeling, and unsupervised scenarios.</description>

      <title>XYScanNet: An Interpretable State Space Model for Perceptual Image Deblurring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep state-space models (SSMs), like recent Mamba architectures, are emerging as a promising alternative to CNN and Transformer networks. Existing Mamba-based restoration methods process the visual data by leveraging a flatten-and-scan strategy that converts image patches into a 1D sequence before scanning. However, this scanning paradigm ignores local pixel dependencies and introduces spatial misalignment by positioning distant pixels incorrectly adjacent, which reduces local noise-awareness and degrades image sharpness in low-level vision tasks. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel slice-and-scan strategy that alternates scanning along intra- and inter-slices. We further design a new Vision State Space Module (VSSM) for image deblurring, and tackle the inefficiency challenges of the current Mamba-based vision module. Building upon this, we develop XYScanNet, an SSM architecture integrated with a lightweight feature fusion module for enhanced image deblurring. XYScanNet, maintains competitive distortion metrics and significantly improves perceptual performance. Experimental results show that XYScanNet enhances KID by $17\%$ compared to the nearest competitor. Our code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Iris: Breaking GUI Complexity with Adaptive Focus and Self-Refining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital agents are increasingly employed to automate tasks in interactive digital environments such as web pages, software applications, and operating systems. While text-based agents built on Large Language Models (LLMs) often require frequent updates due to platform-specific APIs, visual agents leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer enhanced adaptability by interacting directly with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). However, these agents face significant challenges in visual perception, particularly when handling high-resolution, visually complex digital environments. This paper introduces Iris, a foundational visual agent that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: Information-Sensitive Cropping (ISC) and Self-Refining Dual Learning (SRDL). ISC dynamically identifies and prioritizes visually dense regions using a edge detection algorithm, enabling efficient processing by allocating more computational resources to areas with higher information density. SRDL enhances the agent's ability to handle complex tasks by leveraging a dual-learning loop, where improvements in referring (describing UI elements) reinforce grounding (locating elements) and vice versa, all without requiring additional annotated data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Iris achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks with only 850K GUI annotations, outperforming methods using 10x more training data. These improvements further translate to significant gains in both web and OS agent downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Transferable Adversarial Face Attack with Text Controlled Attribute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional adversarial attacks typically produce adversarial examples under norm-constrained conditions, whereas unrestricted adversarial examples are free-form with semantically meaningful perturbations. Current unrestricted adversarial impersonation attacks exhibit limited control over adversarial face attributes and often suffer from low transferability. In this paper, we propose a novel Text Controlled Attribute Attack (TCA$^2$) to generate photorealistic adversarial impersonation faces guided by natural language. Specifically, the category-level personal softmax vector is employed to precisely guide the impersonation attacks. Additionally, we propose both data and model augmentation strategies to achieve transferable attacks on unknown target models. Finally, a generative model, \textit{i.e}, Style-GAN, is utilized to synthesize impersonated faces with desired attributes. Extensive experiments on two high-resolution face recognition datasets validate that our TCA$^2$ method can generate natural text-guided adversarial impersonation faces with high transferability. We also evaluate our method on real-world face recognition systems, \textit{i.e}, Face++ and Aliyun, further demonstrating the practical potential of our approach.</description>

      <title>CATSplat: Context-Aware Transformer with Spatial Guidance for Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting from A Single-View Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, generalizable feed-forward methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting have gained significant attention for their potential to reconstruct 3D scenes using finite resources. These approaches create a 3D radiance field, parameterized by per-pixel 3D Gaussian primitives, from just a few images in a single forward pass. However, unlike multi-view methods that benefit from cross-view correspondences, 3D scene reconstruction with a single-view image remains an underexplored area. In this work, we introduce CATSplat, a novel generalizable transformer-based framework designed to break through the inherent constraints in monocular settings. First, we propose leveraging textual guidance from a visual-language model to complement insufficient information from a single image. By incorporating scene-specific contextual details from text embeddings through cross-attention, we pave the way for context-aware 3D scene reconstruction beyond relying solely on visual cues. Moreover, we advocate utilizing spatial guidance from 3D point features toward comprehensive geometric understanding under single-view settings. With 3D priors, image features can capture rich structural insights for predicting 3D Gaussians without multi-view techniques. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CATSplat in single-view 3D scene reconstruction with high-quality novel view synthesis.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art object detection models, including YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and RT-DETR, for the task of weed detection in smart-spraying applications focusing on three classes: Sugarbeet, Monocot, and Dicot. The performance of these models is compared based on mean Average Precision (mAP) scores and inference times on different GPU and CPU devices. We consider various model variations, such as nano, small, medium, large alongside different image resolutions (320px, 480px, 640px, 800px, 960px). The results highlight the trade-offs between inference time and detection accuracy, providing valuable insights for selecting the most suitable model for real-time weed detection. This study aims to guide the development of efficient and effective smart spraying systems, enhancing agricultural productivity through precise weed management.</description>

      <title>JoVALE: Detecting Human Actions in Video Using Audiovisual and Language Contexts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video Action Detection (VAD) entails localizing and categorizing action instances within videos, which inherently consist of diverse information sources such as audio, visual cues, and surrounding scene contexts. Leveraging this multi-modal information effectively for VAD poses a significant challenge, as the model must identify action-relevant cues with precision. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-modal VAD architecture, referred to as the Joint Actor-centric Visual, Audio, Language Encoder (JoVALE). JoVALE is the first VAD method to integrate audio and visual features with scene descriptive context sourced from large-capacity image captioning models. At the heart of JoVALE is the actor-centric aggregation of audio, visual, and scene descriptive information, enabling adaptive integration of crucial features for recognizing each actor's actions. We have developed a Transformer-based architecture, the Actor-centric Multi-modal Fusion Network, specifically designed to capture the dynamic interactions among actors and their multi-modal contexts. Our evaluation on three prominent VAD benchmarks, including AVA, UCF101-24, and JHMDB51-21, demonstrates that incorporating multi-modal information significantly enhances performance, setting new state-of-the-art performances in the field.</description>

      <title>Defeasible Visual Entailment: Benchmark, Evaluator, and Reward-Driven Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new task called Defeasible Visual Entailment (DVE), where the goal is to allow the modification of the entailment relationship between an image premise and a text hypothesis based on an additional update. While this concept is well-established in Natural Language Inference, it remains unexplored in visual entailment. At a high level, DVE enables models to refine their initial interpretations, leading to improved accuracy and reliability in various applications such as detecting misleading information in images, enhancing visual question answering, and refining decision-making processes in autonomous systems. Existing metrics do not adequately capture the change in the entailment relationship brought by updates. To address this, we propose a novel inference-aware evaluator designed to capture changes in entailment strength induced by updates, using pairwise contrastive learning and categorical information learning. Additionally, we introduce a reward-driven update optimization method to further enhance the quality of updates generated by multimodal models. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluator and optimization method.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting: Leveraging Persistent Homology for Optimized Structural Integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a crucial technique for representing discrete volumetric radiance fields. It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>The Master Key Filters Hypothesis: Deep Filters Are General</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper challenges the prevailing view that convolutional neural network (CNN) filters become increasingly specialized in deeper layers. Motivated by recent observations of clusterable repeating patterns in depthwise separable CNNs (DS-CNNs) trained on ImageNet, we extend this investigation across various domains and datasets. Our analysis of DS-CNNs reveals that deep filters maintain generality, contradicting the expected transition to class-specific filters. We demonstrate the generalizability of these filters through transfer learning experiments, showing that frozen filters from models trained on different datasets perform well and can be further improved when sourced from larger datasets. Our findings indicate that spatial features learned by depthwise separable convolutions remain generic across all layers, domains, and architectures. This research provides new insights into the nature of generalization in neural networks, particularly in DS-CNNs, and has significant implications for transfer learning and model design.</description>

      <title>The Potential of Convolutional Neural Networks for Cancer Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early detection is a prime requisite for successful cancer treatment and increasing its survivability rates, particularly in the most common forms. CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are very potent tools for the analysis and classification of medical images, with particular reference to the early detection of different types of cancer. Ten different cancers have been identified in most of these advances that use CNN techniques for classification. The unique architectures of CNNs employed in each study are focused on pattern recognition for each type of cancer through different datasets. By comparing and analyzing these architectures, the strengths and drawbacks of each approach are pointed out in terms of their efforts toward improving the earlier detection of cancer. The opportunity to embrace CNNs within the clinical sphere was interrogated as support or potential substitution of traditional diagnostic techniques. Furthermore, challenges such as integrating diverse data, how to interpret the results, and ethical dilemmas continue to stalk this field with inconceivable hindrances. This study identifies those CNN architectures that carry out the best work and offers a comparative analysis that reveals to researchers the impact of CNNs on cancer detection in the leap toward boosting diagnostic capabilities in health.</description>

      <title>Reflective Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis has experienced significant advancements owing to increasingly capable NeRF- and 3DGS-based methods. However, reflective object reconstruction remains challenging, lacking a proper solution to achieve real-time, high-quality rendering while accommodating inter-reflection. To fill this gap, we introduce a Reflective Gaussian splatting (Ref-Gaussian) framework characterized with two components: (I) Physically based deferred rendering that empowers the rendering equation with pixel-level material properties via formulating split-sum approximation; (II) Gaussian-grounded inter-reflection that realizes the desired inter-reflection function within a Gaussian splatting paradigm for the first time. To enhance geometry modeling, we further introduce material-aware normal propagation and an initial per-Gaussian shading stage, along with 2D Gaussian primitives. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that Ref-Gaussian surpasses existing approaches in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, and compute efficiency. Further, we show that our method serves as a unified solution for both reflective and non-reflective scenes, going beyond the previous alternatives focusing on only reflective scenes. Also, we illustrate that Ref-Gaussian supports more applications such as relighting and editing.</description>

      <title>Unforgettable Lessons from Forgettable Images: Intra-Class Memorability Matters in Computer Vision Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce intra-class memorability, where certain images within the same class are more memorable than others despite shared category characteristics. To investigate what features make one object instance more memorable than others, we design and conduct human behavior experiments, where participants are shown a series of images one at a time, and they must identify when the current item matches the item presented a few steps back in the sequence. To quantify memorability, we propose the Intra-Class Memorability score (ICMscore), a novel metric that incorporates the temporal intervals between repeated image presentations into its calculation.

      <title>Discovering Hidden Visual Concepts Beyond Linguistic Input in Infant Learning</title>

Abstract: Infants develop complex visual understanding rapidly, even preceding of the acquisition of linguistic inputs. As computer vision seeks to replicate the human vision system, understanding infant visual development may offer valuable insights. In this paper, we present an interdisciplinary study exploring this question: can a computational model that imitates the infant learning process develop broader visual concepts that extend beyond the vocabulary it has heard, similar to how infants naturally learn? To investigate this, we analyze a recently published model in Science by Vong et al.,which is trained on longitudinal, egocentric images of a single child paired with transcribed parental speech. We introduce a training-free framework that can discover visual concept neurons hidden in the model's internal representations. Our findings show that these neurons can classify objects outside its original vocabulary. Furthermore, we compare the visual representations in infant-like models with those in moder computer vision models, such as CLIP or ImageNet pre-trained model, highlighting key similarities and differences. Ultimately, our work bridges cognitive science and computer vision by analyzing the internal representations of a computational model trained on an infant's visual and linguistic inputs.</description>

      <title>Detection, Retrieval, and Explanation Unified: A Violence Detection System Based on Knowledge Graphs and GAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, violence detection systems developed using unified multimodal models have achieved significant success and attracted widespread attention. However, most of these systems face two critical challenges: the lack of interpretability as black-box models and limited functionality, offering only classification or retrieval capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel interpretable violence detection system, termed the Three-in-One (TIO) System. The TIO system integrates knowledge graphs (KG) and graph attention networks (GAT) to provide three core functionalities: detection, retrieval, and explanation. Specifically, the system processes each video frame along with text descriptions generated by a large language model (LLM) for videos containing potential violent behavior. It employs ImageBind to generate high-dimensional embeddings for constructing a knowledge graph, uses GAT for reasoning, and applies lightweight time series modules to extract video embedding features. The final step connects a classifier and retriever for multi-functional outputs. The interpretability of KG enables the system to verify the reasoning process behind each output. Additionally, the paper introduces several lightweight methods to reduce the resource consumption of the TIO system and enhance its efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. A case study further reveals an intriguing phenomenon: as the number of bystanders increases, the occurrence of violent behavior tends to decrease.</description>

      <title>OpenAI ChatGPT interprets Radiological Images: GPT-4 as a Medical Doctor for a Fast Check-Up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: OpenAI released version GPT-4 on March 14, 2023, following the success of ChatGPT, which was announced in November 2022. In addition to the existing GPT-3 features, GPT-4 can interpret images. To achieve this, the processing power and model have been significantly improved. The ability to process and interpret images goes far beyond the applications and effectiveness of artificial intelligence. In this study, we first explored the interpretation of radiological images in healthcare using artificial intelligence (AI). Then, we experimented with the image interpretation capability of the GPT-4. In this way, we addressed the question of whether artificial intelligence (AI) can replace a healthcare professional (e.g., a medical doctor) or whether it can be used as a decision-support tool that makes decisions easier and more reliable. Our results showed that ChatGPT is not sufficient and accurate to analyze chest X-ray images, but it can provide interpretations that can assist medical doctors or clinicians.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a large-scale fine-grained dataset using high-resolution images captured from locations worldwide. Compared to existing datasets, our dataset offers a significantly larger size and includes a higher level of detail, making it uniquely suited for fine-grained 3D applications. Notably, our dataset is built using drone-captured aerial imagery, which provides a more accurate perspective for capturing real-world site layouts and architectural structures. By reconstructing environments with these detailed images, our dataset supports applications such as the COLMAP format for Gaussian Splatting and the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method. It is compatible with widely-used techniques including SLAM, Multi-View Stereo, and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), enabling accurate 3D reconstructions and point clouds. This makes it a benchmark for reconstruction and segmentation tasks. The dataset enables seamless integration with multi-modal data, supporting a range of 3D applications, from architectural reconstruction to virtual tourism. Its flexibility promotes innovation, facilitating breakthroughs in 3D modeling and analysis.</description>

      <title>CityLoc: 6DoF Pose Distributional Localization for Text Descriptions in Large-Scale Scenes with Gaussian Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localizing textual descriptions within large-scale 3D scenes presents inherent ambiguities, such as identifying all traffic lights in a city. Addressing this, we introduce a method to generate distributions of camera poses conditioned on textual descriptions, facilitating robust reasoning for broadly defined concepts.
  Our approach employs a diffusion-based architecture to refine noisy 6DoF camera poses towards plausible locations, with conditional signals derived from pre-trained text encoders. Integration with the pretrained Vision-Language Model, CLIP, establishes a strong linkage between text descriptions and pose distributions. Enhancement of localization accuracy is achieved by rendering candidate poses using 3D Gaussian splatting, which corrects misaligned samples through visual reasoning.
  We validate our method's superiority by comparing it against standard distribution estimation methods across five large-scale datasets, demonstrating consistent outperformance. Code, datasets and more information will be publicly available at our project page.</description>

      <title>AdaFV: Rethinking of Visual-Language alignment for VLM acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of VLMs often relies on the dynamic high-resolution schema that adaptively augments the input images to multiple crops, so that the details of the images can be retained. However, such approaches result in a large number of redundant visual tokens, thus significantly reducing the efficiency of the VLMs. To improve the VLMs' efficiency without introducing extra training costs, many research works are proposed to reduce the visual tokens by filtering the uninformative visual tokens or aggregating their information. Some approaches propose to reduce the visual tokens according to the self-attention of VLMs, which are biased, to result in inaccurate responses. The token reduction approaches solely rely on visual cues are text-agnostic, and fail to focus on the areas that are most relevant to the question, especially when the queried objects are non-salient to the image. In this work, we first conduct experiments to show that the original text embeddings are aligned with the visual tokens, without bias on the tailed visual tokens. We then propose a self-adaptive cross-modality attention mixture mechanism that dynamically leverages the effectiveness of visual saliency and text-to-image similarity in the pre-LLM layers to select the visual tokens that are informative. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art training-free VLM acceleration performance, especially when the reduction rate is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>A Simple Aerial Detection Baseline of Multimodal Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multimodal language models (MLMs) based on generative pre-trained Transformer are considered powerful candidates for unifying various domains and tasks. MLMs developed for remote sensing (RS) have demonstrated outstanding performance in multiple tasks, such as visual question answering and visual grounding. In addition to visual grounding that detects specific objects corresponded to given instruction, aerial detection, which detects all objects of multiple categories, is also a valuable and challenging task for RS foundation models. However, aerial detection has not been explored by existing RS MLMs because the autoregressive prediction mechanism of MLMs differs significantly from the detection outputs. In this paper, we present a simple baseline for applying MLMs to aerial detection for the first time, named LMMRotate. Specifically, we first introduce a normalization method to transform detection outputs into textual outputs to be compatible with the MLM framework. Then, we propose a evaluation method, which ensures a fair comparison between MLMs and conventional object detection models. We construct the baseline by fine-tuning open-source general-purpose MLMs and achieve impressive detection performance comparable to conventional detector. We hope that this baseline will serve as a reference for future MLM development, enabling more comprehensive capabilities for understanding RS images.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation models have made impressive progress, but they still struggle with generating videos with complex features. This limitation often arises from the inability of the text encoder to produce accurate embeddings, which hinders the video generation model. In this work, we propose a novel approach to overcome this challenge by selecting the optimal text embedding through interpolation in the embedding space. We demonstrate that this method enables the video generation model to produce the desired videos. Additionally, we introduce a simple algorithm using perpendicular foot embeddings and cosine similarity to identify the optimal interpolation embedding. Our findings highlight the importance of accurate text embeddings and offer a pathway for improving text-to-video generation performance.</description>

      <title>HFGCN:Hypergraph Fusion Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, action recognition has received much attention and wide application due to its important role in video understanding. Most of the researches on action recognition methods focused on improving the performance via various deep learning methods rather than the classification of skeleton points. The topological modeling between skeleton points and body parts was seldom considered. Although some studies have used a data-driven approach to classify the topology of the skeleton point, the nature of the skeleton point in terms of kinematics has not been taken into consideration. Therefore, in this paper, we draw on the theory of kinematics to adapt the topological relations of the skeleton point and propose a topological relation classification based on body parts and distance from core of body. To synthesize these topological relations for action recognition, we propose a novel Hypergraph Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (HFGCN). In particular, the proposed model is able to focus on the human skeleton points and the different body parts simultaneously, and thus construct the topology, which improves the recognition accuracy obviously. We use a hypergraph to represent the categorical relationships of these skeleton points and incorporate the hypergraph into a graph convolution network to model the higher-order relationships among the skeleton points and enhance the feature representation of the network. In addition, our proposed hypergraph attention module and hypergraph graph convolution module optimize topology modeling in temporal and channel dimensions, respectively, to further enhance the feature representation of the network. We conducted extensive experiments on three widely used datasets.The results validate that our proposed method can achieve the best performance when compared with the state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has achieved superior performance in novel view synthesis and 3D scene representation, but its practical applications are hindered by slow convergence and reliance on dense training views. To this end, we present DWTNeRF, a unified framework based on Instant-NGP's fast-training hash encoding. It is coupled with regularization terms designed for few-shot NeRF, which operates on sparse training views. Our DWTNeRF additionally includes a novel Discrete Wavelet loss that allows explicit prioritization of low frequencies directly in the training objective, reducing few-shot NeRF's overfitting on high frequencies in earlier training stages. We also introduce a model-based approach, based on multi-head attention, that is compatible with INGP, which are sensitive to architectural changes. On the 3-shot LLFF benchmark, DWTNeRF outperforms Vanilla INGP by 15.07% in PSNR, 24.45% in SSIM and 36.30% in LPIPS. Our approach encourages a re-thinking of current few-shot approaches for fast-converging implicit representations like INGP or 3DGS.</description>

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) enhances the real world by integrating virtual content, yet ensuring the quality, usability, and safety of AR experiences presents significant challenges. Could Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a solution for the automated evaluation of AR-generated scenes? Could Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a solution for the automated evaluation of AR-generated scenes? In this study, we evaluate the capabilities of three state-of-the-art commercial VLMs -- GPT, Gemini, and Claude -- in identifying and describing AR scenes. For this purpose, we use DiverseAR, the first AR dataset specifically designed to assess VLMs' ability to analyze virtual content across a wide range of AR scene complexities. Our findings demonstrate that VLMs are generally capable of perceiving and describing AR scenes, achieving a True Positive Rate (TPR) of up to 93% for perception and 71% for description. While they excel at identifying obvious virtual objects, such as a glowing apple, they struggle when faced with seamlessly integrated content, such as a virtual pot with realistic shadows. Our results highlight both the strengths and the limitations of VLMs in understanding AR scenarios. We identify key factors affecting VLM performance, including virtual content placement, rendering quality, and physical plausibility. This study underscores the potential of VLMs as tools for evaluating the quality of AR experiences.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging modality and provides comprehensive anatomical and functional insights into the human body. However, its long acquisition times can lead to patient discomfort, motion artifacts, and limiting real-time applications. To address these challenges, strategies such as parallel imaging have been applied, which utilize multiple receiver coils to speed up the data acquisition process. Additionally, compressed sensing (CS) is a method that facilitates image reconstruction from sparse data, significantly reducing image acquisition time by minimizing the amount of data collection needed. Recently, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool for improving MRI reconstruction. It has been integrated with parallel imaging and CS principles to achieve faster and more accurate MRI reconstructions. This review comprehensively examines DL-based techniques for MRI reconstruction. We categorize and discuss various DL-based methods, including end-to-end approaches, unrolled optimization, and federated learning, highlighting their potential benefits. Our systematic review highlights significant contributions and underscores the potential of DL in MRI reconstruction. Additionally, we summarize key results and trends in DL-based MRI reconstruction, including quantitative metrics, the dataset, acceleration factors, and the progress of and research interest in DL techniques over time. Finally, we discuss potential future directions and the importance of DL-based MRI reconstruction in advancing medical imaging. To facilitate further research in this area, we provide a GitHub repository that includes up-to-date DL-based MRI reconstruction publications and public datasets-https://github.com/mosaf/Awesome-DL-based-CS-MRI.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Point-LN, a novel lightweight framework engineered for efficient 3D point cloud classification. Point-LN integrates essential non-parametric components-such as Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and non-learnable positional encoding-with a streamlined learnable classifier that significantly enhances classification accuracy while maintaining a minimal parameter footprint. This hybrid architecture ensures low computational costs and rapid inference speeds, making Point-LN ideal for real-time and resource-constrained applications. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN, demonstrate that Point-LN achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, all while offering exceptional efficiency. These results establish Point-LN as a robust and scalable solution for diverse point cloud classification tasks, highlighting its potential for widespread adoption in various computer vision applications.</description>

      <title>Nautilus: Locality-aware Autoencoder for Scalable Mesh Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Triangle meshes are fundamental to 3D applications, enabling efficient modification and rasterization while maintaining compatibility with standard rendering pipelines. However, current automatic mesh generation methods typically rely on intermediate representations that lack the continuous surface quality inherent to meshes. Converting these representations into meshes produces dense, suboptimal outputs. Although recent autoregressive approaches demonstrate promise in directly modeling mesh vertices and faces, they are constrained by the limitation in face count, scalability, and structural fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose Nautilus, a locality-aware autoencoder for artist-like mesh generation that leverages the local properties of manifold meshes to achieve structural fidelity and efficient representation. Our approach introduces a novel tokenization algorithm that preserves face proximity relationships and compresses sequence length through locally shared vertices and edges, enabling the generation of meshes with an unprecedented scale of up to 5,000 faces. Furthermore, we develop a Dual-stream Point Conditioner that provides multi-scale geometric guidance, ensuring global consistency and local structural fidelity by capturing fine-grained geometric features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Nautilus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both fidelity and scalability.

      <title>Prompt-Aware Controllable Shadow Removal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shadow removal aims to restore the image content in shadowed regions. While deep learning-based methods have shown promising results, they still face key challenges: 1) uncontrolled removal of all shadows, or 2) controllable removal but heavily relies on precise shadow region masks. To address these issues, we introduce a novel paradigm: prompt-aware controllable shadow removal. Unlike existing approaches, our paradigm allows for targeted shadow removal from specific subjects based on user prompts (e.g., dots, lines, or subject masks). This approach eliminates the need for shadow annotations and offers flexible, user-controlled shadow removal. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end learnable model, the Prompt-Aware Controllable Shadow Removal Network (PACSRNet). PACSRNet consists of two key modules: a prompt-aware module that generates shadow masks for the specified subject based on the user prompt, and a shadow removal module that uses the shadow prior from the first module to restore the content in the shadowed regions. Additionally, we enhance the shadow removal module by incorporating feature information from the prompt-aware module through a linear operation, providing prompt-guided support for shadow removal. Recognizing that existing shadow removal datasets lack diverse user prompts, we contribute a new dataset specifically designed for prompt-based controllable shadow removal. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of PACSRNet.</description>

      <title>CILP-FGDI: Exploiting Vision-Language Model for Generalizable Person Re-Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Visual Language Model, known for its robust cross-modal capabilities, has been extensively applied in various computer vision tasks. In this paper, we explore the use of CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), a vision-language model pretrained on large-scale image-text pairs to align visual and textual features, for acquiring fine-grained and domain-invariant representations in generalizable person re-identification. The adaptation of CLIP to the task presents two primary challenges: learning more fine-grained features to enhance discriminative ability, and learning more domain-invariant features to improve the model's generalization capabilities. To mitigate the first challenge thereby enhance the ability to learn fine-grained features, a three-stage strategy is proposed to boost the accuracy of text descriptions. Initially, the image encoder is trained to effectively adapt to person re-identification tasks. In the second stage, the features extracted by the image encoder are used to generate textual descriptions (i.e., prompts) for each image. Finally, the text encoder with the learned prompts is employed to guide the training of the final image encoder. To enhance the model's generalization capabilities to unseen domains, a bidirectional guiding method is introduced to learn domain-invariant image features. Specifically, domain-invariant and domain-relevant prompts are generated, and both positive (pulling together image features and domain-invariant prompts) and negative (pushing apart image features and domain-relevant prompts) views are used to train the image encoder. Collectively, these strategies contribute to the development of an innovative CLIP-based framework for learning fine-grained generalized features in person re-identification.</description>

      <title>Efficient Feature Fusion for UAV Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images poses significant challenges due to unstable image quality, small object sizes, complex backgrounds, and environmental occlusions. Small objects, in particular, occupy small portions of images, making their accurate detection highly difficult. Existing multi-scale feature fusion methods address these challenges to some extent by aggregating features across different resolutions. However, they often fail to effectively balance the classification and localization performance for small objects, primarily due to insufficient feature representation and imbalanced network information flow. In this paper, we propose a novel feature fusion framework specifically designed for UAV object detection tasks to enhance both localization accuracy and classification performance. The proposed framework integrates hybrid upsampling and downsampling modules, enabling feature maps from different network depths to be flexibly adjusted to arbitrary resolutions. This design facilitates cross-layer connections and multi-scale feature fusion, ensuring improved representation of small objects. Our approach leverages hybrid downsampling to enhance fine-grained feature representation, improving spatial localization of small targets, even under complex conditions. Simultaneously, the upsampling module aggregates global contextual information, optimizing feature consistency across scales and enhancing classification robustness in cluttered scenes. Experimental results on two public UAV datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Integrated into the YOLO-v10 model, our method achieves a 2% improvement in average precision (AP) compared to the baseline YOLO-v10 model, while maintaining the same number of parameters. These results highlight the potential of our framework for accurate and efficient UAV object detection.</description>

      <title>REMOTE: Real-time Ego-motion Tracking for Various Endoscopes via Multimodal Visual Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time ego-motion tracking for endoscope is a significant task for efficient navigation and robotic automation of endoscopy. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to perform real-time ego-motion tracking for endoscope. Firstly, a multi-modal visual feature learning network is proposed to perform relative pose prediction, in which the motion feature from the optical flow, the scene features and the joint feature from two adjacent observations are all extracted for prediction. Due to more correlation information in the channel dimension of the concatenated image, a novel feature extractor is designed based on an attention mechanism to integrate multi-dimensional information from the concatenation of two continuous frames. To extract more complete feature representation from the fused features, a novel pose decoder is proposed to predict the pose transformation from the concatenated feature map at the end of the framework. At last, the absolute pose of endoscope is calculated based on relative poses. The experiment is conducted on three datasets of various endoscopic scenes and the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the inference speed of the proposed method is over 30 frames per second, which meets the real-time requirement. The project page is here: remote-bmxs.netlify.app</description>

      <title>A Benchmark and Evaluation for Real-World Out-of-Distribution Detection Using Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a task that detects OOD samples during inference to ensure the safety of deployed models. However, conventional benchmarks have reached performance saturation, making it difficult to compare recent OOD detection methods. To address this challenge, we introduce three novel OOD detection benchmarks that enable a deeper understanding of method characteristics and reflect real-world conditions. First, we present ImageNet-X, designed to evaluate performance under challenging semantic shifts. Second, we propose ImageNet-FS-X for full-spectrum OOD detection, assessing robustness to covariate shifts (feature distribution shifts). Finally, we propose Wilds-FS-X, which extends these evaluations to real-world datasets, offering a more comprehensive testbed. Our experiments reveal that recent CLIP-based OOD detection methods struggle to varying degrees across the three proposed benchmarks, and none of them consistently outperforms the others. We hope the community goes beyond specific benchmarks and includes more challenging conditions reflecting real-world scenarios. The code is https://github.com/hoshi23/OOD-X-Benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Advances in Multimodal Adaptation and Generalization: From Traditional Approaches to Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, achieving domain adaptation and generalization poses significant challenges, as models must adapt to or generalize across unknown target distributions. Extending these capabilities to unseen multimodal distributions, i.e., multimodal domain adaptation and generalization, is even more challenging due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities. Significant progress has been made over the years, with applications ranging from action recognition to semantic segmentation. Besides, the recent advent of large-scale pre-trained multimodal foundation models, such as CLIP, has inspired works leveraging these models to enhance adaptation and generalization performances or adapting them to downstream tasks. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of recent advances from traditional approaches to foundation models, covering: (1) Multimodal domain adaptation; (2) Multimodal test-time adaptation; (3) Multimodal domain generalization; (4) Domain adaptation and generalization with the help of multimodal foundation models; and (5) Adaptation of multimodal foundation models. For each topic, we formally define the problem and thoroughly review existing methods. Additionally, we analyze relevant datasets and applications, highlighting open challenges and potential future research directions. We maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date literature at https://github.com/donghao51/Awesome-Multimodal-Adaptation.</description>

      <title>UP-VLA: A Unified Understanding and Prediction Model for Embodied Agent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to improve the generalization capabilities. VLMs, typically pre-trained on vision-language understanding tasks, provide rich semantic knowledge and reasoning abilities. However, prior research has shown that VLMs often focus on high-level semantic content and neglect low-level features, limiting their ability to capture detailed spatial information and understand physical dynamics. These aspects, which are crucial for embodied control tasks, remain underexplored in existing pre-training paradigms. In this paper, we investigate the training paradigm for VLAs, and introduce \textbf{UP-VLA}, a \textbf{U}nified VLA model training with both multi-modal \textbf{U}nderstanding and future \textbf{P}rediction objectives, enhancing both high-level semantic comprehension and low-level spatial understanding. Experimental results show that UP-VLA achieves a 33% improvement on the Calvin ABC-D benchmark compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. Additionally, UP-VLA demonstrates improved success rates in real-world manipulation tasks, particularly those requiring precise spatial information.</description>

      <title>Contrast-Aware Calibration for Fine-Tuned CLIP: Leveraging Image-Text Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities and can quickly adapt to downstream tasks through prompt fine-tuning. Unfortunately, in classification tasks involving non-training classes, known as open-vocabulary setting, fine-tuned VLMs often overfit to train classes, resulting in a misalignment between confidence scores and actual accuracy on unseen classes, which significantly undermines their reliability in real-world deployments. Existing confidence calibration methods typically require training parameters or analyzing features from the training dataset, restricting their ability to generalize unseen classes without corresponding train data. Moreover, VLM-specific calibration methods rely solely on text features from train classes as calibration indicators, which inherently limits their ability to calibrate train classes. To address these challenges, we propose an effective multimodal calibration method Contrast-Aware Calibration (CAC). Building on the original CLIP's zero-shot adaptability and the conclusion from empirical analysis that poor intra-class and inter-class discriminative ability on unseen classes is the root cause, we calculate calibration weights based on the contrastive difference between the original and fine-tuned CLIP. This method not only adapts to calibrating unseen classes but also overcomes the limitations of previous VLM calibration methods that could not calibrate train classes. In experiments involving 11 datasets with 5 fine-tuning methods, CAC consistently achieved the best calibration effect on both train and unseen classes without sacrificing accuracy and inference speed.</description>

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition plays a pivotal role in understanding hidden emotions and has applications across various fields. Traditional recognition methods assume access to all training data at once, but real-world scenarios involve continuously evolving data streams. To respond to the requirement of adapting to new data while retaining previously learned knowledge, we introduce the first benchmark specifically designed for incremental micro-expression recognition. Our contributions include: Firstly, we formulate the incremental learning setting tailored for micro-expression recognition. Secondly, we organize sequential datasets with carefully curated learning orders to reflect real-world scenarios. Thirdly, we define two cross-evaluation-based testing protocols, each targeting distinct evaluation objectives. Finally, we provide six baseline methods and their corresponding evaluation results. This benchmark lays the groundwork for advancing incremental micro-expression recognition research. All source code used in this study will be publicly available at https://github.com/ZhengQinLai/IMER-benchmark.</description>

Abstract: Blood oxygen saturation (SpO$_2$) is an essential indicator of respiratory functionality and is receiving increasing attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical findings show that it is possible for COVID-19 patients to have significantly low SpO$_2$ before any obvious symptoms. The prevalence of cameras has motivated researchers to investigate methods for monitoring SpO$_2$ using videos. Most prior schemes involving smartphones are contact-based: They require a fingertip to cover the phone's camera and the nearby light source to capture re-emitted light from the illuminated tissue. In this paper, we propose the first convolutional neural network based noncontact SpO$_2$ estimation scheme using smartphone cameras. The scheme analyzes the videos of a participant's hand for physiological sensing, which is convenient and comfortable, and can protect their privacy and allow for keeping face masks on. We design our neural network architectures inspired by the optophysiological models for SpO$_2$ measurement and demonstrate the explainability by visualizing the weights for channel combination. Our proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art model that is designed for contact-based SpO$_2$ measurement, showing the potential of our proposed method to contribute to public health. We also analyze the impact of skin type and the side of a hand on SpO$_2$ estimation performance.</description>

      <title>Training Image Derivatives: Increased Accuracy and Universal Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Derivative training is an established method that can significantly increase the accuracy of neural networks in certain low-dimensional tasks. In this paper, we extend this improvement to an illustrative image analysis problem: reconstructing the vertices of a cube from its image. By training the derivatives with respect to the cube's six degrees of freedom, we achieve a 25-fold increase in accuracy for noiseless inputs. Additionally, derivative knowledge offers a novel approach to enhancing network robustness, which has traditionally been understood in terms of two types of vulnerabilities: excessive sensitivity to minor perturbations and failure to detect significant image changes. Conventional robust training relies on output invariance, which inherently creates a trade-off between these two vulnerabilities. By leveraging derivative information we compute non-trivial output changes in response to arbitrary input perturbations. This resolves the trade-off, yielding a network that is twice as robust and five times more accurate than the best case under the invariance assumption. Unlike conventional robust training, this outcome can be further improved by simply increasing the network capacity. This approach is applicable to phase retrieval problems and other scenarios where a sufficiently smooth manifold parametrization can be obtained.</description>

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for crafting a synthetic dataset that captures the essential information of a training dataset, facilitating the training of accurate neural models. Its applications span various domains, including transfer learning, federated learning, and neural architecture search. The most popular methods for constructing the synthetic data rely on matching the convergence properties of training the model with the synthetic dataset and the training dataset. However, using the empirical loss as the criterion must be thought of as auxiliary in the same sense that the training set is an approximate substitute for the population distribution, and the latter is the data of interest. Yet despite its popularity, an aspect that remains unexplored is the relationship of DD to its generalization, particularly across uncommon subgroups. That is, how can we ensure that a model trained on the synthetic dataset performs well when faced with samples from regions with low population density? Here, the representativeness and coverage of the dataset become salient over the guaranteed training error at inference. Drawing inspiration from distributionally robust optimization, we introduce an algorithm that combines clustering with the minimization of a risk measure on the loss to conduct DD. We provide a theoretical rationale for our approach and demonstrate its effective generalization and robustness across subgroups through numerical experiments.

      <description>arXiv:2403.19622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving generalizability in solving out-of-distribution tasks is one of the ultimate goals of learning robotic manipulation. Recent progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has shown that VLM-based task planners can alleviate the difficulty of solving novel tasks, by decomposing the compounded tasks as a plan of sequentially executing primitive-level skills that have been already mastered. It is also promising for robotic manipulation to adapt such composable generalization ability, in the form of composable generalization agents (CGAs). However, the community lacks of reliable design of primitive skills and a sufficient amount of primitive-level data annotations. Therefore, we propose RH20T-P, a primitive-level robotic manipulation dataset, which contains about 38k video clips covering 67 diverse manipulation tasks in real-world scenarios. Each clip is manually annotated according to a set of meticulously designed primitive skills that are common in robotic manipulation. Furthermore, we standardize a plan-execute CGA paradigm and implement an exemplar baseline called RA-P on our RH20T-P, whose positive performance on solving unseen tasks validates that the proposed dataset can offer composable generalization ability to robotic manipulation agents.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for learned synergistic reconstruction of medical images using multibranch generative models. Leveraging variational autoencoders (VAEs), our model learns from pairs of images simultaneously, enabling effective denoising and reconstruction. Synergistic image reconstruction is achieved by incorporating the trained models in a regularizer that evaluates the distance between the images and the model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on both Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) and positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) datasets, showcasing improved image quality for low-dose imaging. Despite challenges such as patch decomposition and model limitations, our results underscore the potential of generative models for enhancing medical imaging reconstruction.</description>

      <title>DAWN: Domain-Adaptive Weakly Supervised Nuclei Segmentation via Cross-Task Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weakly supervised segmentation methods have gained significant attention due to their ability to reduce the reliance on costly pixel-level annotations during model training. However, the current weakly supervised nuclei segmentation approaches typically follow a two-stage pseudo-label generation and network training process. The performance of the nuclei segmentation heavily relies on the quality of the generated pseudo-labels, thereby limiting its effectiveness. This paper introduces a novel domain-adaptive weakly supervised nuclei segmentation framework using cross-task interaction strategies to overcome the challenge of pseudo-label generation. Specifically, we utilize weakly annotated data to train an auxiliary detection task, which assists the domain adaptation of the segmentation network. To enhance the efficiency of domain adaptation, we design a consistent feature constraint module integrating prior knowledge from the source domain. Furthermore, we develop pseudo-label optimization and interactive training methods to improve the domain transfer capability. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive comparative and ablation experiments on six datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing weakly supervised approaches. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable or even better performance than fully supervised methods. Our code will be released in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/DAWN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the first publicly accessible labeled multi-modal perception dataset for autonomous maritime navigation, focusing on in-water obstacles within the aquatic environment to enhance situational awareness for Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs). This dataset, collected over 4 years and consisting of diverse objects encountered under varying environmental conditions, aims to bridge the research gap in autonomous surface vehicles by providing a multi-modal, annotated, and ego-centric perception dataset, for object detection and classification. We also show the applicability of the proposed dataset by training deep learning-based open-source perception algorithms that have shown success. We expect that our dataset will contribute to development of the marine autonomy pipelines and marine (field) robotics. This dataset is opensource and can be found at https://seepersea.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Editable Concept Bottleneck Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15476v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have garnered much attention for their ability to elucidate the prediction process through a humanunderstandable concept layer. However, most previous studies focused on cases where the data, including concepts, are clean. In many scenarios, we often need to remove/insert some training data or new concepts from trained CBMs for reasons such as privacy concerns, data mislabelling, spurious concepts, and concept annotation errors. Thus, deriving efficient editable CBMs without retraining from scratch remains a challenge, particularly in large-scale applications. To address these challenges, we propose Editable Concept Bottleneck Models (ECBMs). Specifically, ECBMs support three different levels of data removal: concept-label-level, concept-level, and data-level. ECBMs enjoy mathematically rigorous closed-form approximations derived from influence functions that obviate the need for retraining. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and adaptability of our ECBMs, affirming their practical value in CBMs.</description>

      <title>Tracing Representation Progression: Analyzing and Enhancing Layer-Wise Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing the similarity of internal representations has been an important technique for understanding the behavior of deep neural networks. Most existing methods for analyzing the similarity between representations of high dimensions, such as those based on Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), rely on statistical properties of the representations for a set of data points. In this paper, we focus on transformer models and study the similarity of representations between the hidden layers of individual transformers. In this context, we show that a simple sample-wise cosine similarity metric is capable of capturing the similarity and aligns with the complicated CKA. Our experimental results on common transformers reveal that representations across layers are positively correlated, with similarity increasing when layers get closer. We provide a theoretical justification for this phenomenon under the geodesic curve assumption for the learned transformer. We then show that an increase in representation similarity implies an increase in predicted probability when directly applying the last-layer classifier to any hidden layer representation. We then propose an aligned training method to improve the effectiveness of shallow layer by enhancing the similarity between internal representations, with trained models that enjoy the following properties: (1) more early saturation events, (2) layer-wise accuracies monotonically increase and reveal the minimal depth needed for the given task, (3) when served as multi-exit models, they achieve on-par performance with standard multi-exit architectures which consist of additional classifiers designed for early exiting in shallow layers. To our knowledge, our work is the first to show that one common classifier is sufficient for multi-exit models. We conduct experiments on both vision and NLP tasks to demonstrate the performance of the proposed aligned training.</description>

      <title>Policy Gradient-Driven Noise Mask</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14568v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning classifiers face significant challenges when dealing with heterogeneous multi-modal and multi-organ biomedical datasets. The low-level feature distinguishability limited to imaging-modality hinders the classifiers' ability to learn high-level semantic relationships, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, image augmentation strategies are employed as regularization techniques. While additive noise input during network training is a well-established augmentation as regularization method, modern pipelines often favor more robust techniques such as dropout and weight decay. This preference stems from the observation that combining these established techniques with noise input can adversely affect model performance. In this study, we propose a novel pretraining pipeline that learns to generate conditional noise mask specifically tailored to improve performance on multi-modal and multi-organ datasets. As a reinforcement learning algorithm, our approach employs a dual-component system comprising a very light-weight policy network that learns to sample conditional noise using a differentiable beta distribution as well as a classifier network. The policy network is trained using the reinforce algorithm to generate image-specific noise masks that regularize the classifier during pretraining. A key aspect is that the policy network's role is limited to obtaining an intermediate (or heated) model before fine-tuning. During inference, the policy network is omitted, allowing direct comparison between the baseline and noise-regularized models. We conducted experiments and related analyses on RadImageNet datasets. Results demonstrate that fine-tuning the intermediate models consistently outperforms conventional training algorithms on both classification and generalization to unseen concept tasks. https://github.com/convergedmachine/Policy-Gradient-Driven-Noise-Mask</description>

      <title>Multimodal ELBO with Diffusion Decoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal variational autoencoders have demonstrated their ability to learn the relationships between different modalities by mapping them into a latent representation. Their design and capacity to perform any-to-any conditional and unconditional generation make them appealing. However, different variants of multimodal VAEs often suffer from generating low-quality output, particularly when complex modalities such as images are involved. In addition to that, they frequently exhibit low coherence among the generated modalities when sampling from the joint distribution. To address these limitations, we propose a new variant of the multimodal VAE ELBO that incorporates a better decoder using a diffusion generative model. The diffusion decoder enables the model to learn complex modalities and generate high-quality outputs. The multimodal model can also seamlessly integrate with a standard feed-forward decoder for different types of modality, facilitating end-to-end training and inference. Furthermore, we introduce an auxiliary score-based model to enhance the unconditional generation capabilities of our proposed approach. This approach addresses the limitations imposed by conventional multimodal VAEs and opens up new possibilities to improve multimodal generation tasks. Our model provides state-of-the-art results compared to other multimodal VAEs in different datasets with higher coherence and superior quality in the generated modalities.</description>

      <title>Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow: Towards Minimum MSE Photo-Realistic Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00418v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photo-realistic image restoration algorithms are typically evaluated by distortion measures (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and by perceptual quality measures (e.g., FID, NIQE), where the desire is to attain the lowest possible distortion without compromising on perceptual quality. To achieve this goal, current methods commonly attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colonoscopy is currently one of the most sensitive screening methods for colorectal cancer. This study investigates the frontiers of intelligent colonoscopy techniques and their prospective implications for multimodal medical applications. With this goal, we begin by assessing the current data-centric and model-centric landscapes through four tasks for colonoscopic scene perception, including classification, detection, segmentation, and vision-language understanding. This assessment enables us to identify domain-specific challenges and reveals that multimodal research in colonoscopy remains open for further exploration. To embrace the coming multimodal era, we establish three foundational initiatives: a large-scale multimodal instruction tuning dataset ColonINST, a colonoscopy-designed multimodal language model ColonGPT, and a multimodal benchmark. To facilitate ongoing monitoring of this rapidly evolving field, we provide a public website for the latest updates: https://github.com/ai4colonoscopy/IntelliScope.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Representation Misalignment in Contrastive Learning via Influence Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning, commonly applied in large-scale multimodal models, often relies on data from diverse and often unreliable sources, which can include misaligned or mislabeled text-image pairs. This frequently leads to robustness issues and hallucinations, ultimately causing performance degradation. Data valuation is an efficient way to detect and trace these misalignments. Nevertheless, existing methods are computationally expensive for large-scale models. Although computationally efficient, classical influence functions are inadequate for contrastive learning models, as they were initially designed for pointwise loss. Furthermore, contrastive learning involves minimizing the distance between positive sample modalities while maximizing the distance between negative sample modalities. This necessitates evaluating the influence of samples from both perspectives. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Extended Influence Function for Contrastive Loss (ECIF), an influence function crafted for contrastive loss. ECIF considers both positive and negative samples and provides a closed-form approximation of contrastive learning models, eliminating the need for retraining. Building upon ECIF, we develop a series of algorithms for data evaluation, misalignment detection, and misprediction trace-back tasks. Experimental results demonstrate our ECIF advances the transparency and interpretability of CLIP-style embedding models by offering a more accurate assessment of data impact and model alignment compared to traditional baseline methods.</description>

      <title>FM2DS: Few-Shot Multimodal Multihop Data Synthesis with Knowledge Distillation for Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal multihop question answering is a complex task that requires reasoning over multiple sources of information, such as images and text, to answer questions. While there has been significant progress in visual question answering, the multihop setting remains unexplored due to the lack of high-quality datasets. Current methods focus on single-hop question answering or a single modality, which makes them unsuitable for real-world scenarios such as analyzing multimodal educational materials, summarizing lengthy academic articles, or interpreting scientific studies that combine charts, images, and text. To address this gap, we propose a novel methodology, introducing the first framework for creating a high-quality dataset that enables training models for multimodal multihop question answering. Our approach consists of a 5-stage pipeline that involves acquiring relevant multimodal documents from Wikipedia, synthetically generating high-level questions and answers, and validating them through rigorous criteria to ensure quality data. We evaluate our methodology by training models on our synthesized dataset and testing on two benchmarks, our results demonstrate that, with an equal sample size, models trained on our synthesized data outperform those trained on human-collected data by 1.9 in exact match (EM) on average. We believe our data synthesis method will serve as a strong foundation for training and evaluating multimodal multihop question answering models.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Agent Tuning: Building a VLM-Driven Agent for Efficient Tool Usage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) prompts the development of multi-modal agents, which are used as a controller to call external tools, providing a feasible way to solve practical tasks. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal agent tuning method that automatically generates multi-modal tool-usage data and tunes a vision-language model (VLM) as the controller for powerful tool-usage reasoning. To preserve the data quality, we prompt the GPT-4o mini model to generate queries, files, and trajectories, followed by query-file and trajectory verifiers. Based on the data synthesis pipeline, we collect the MM-Traj dataset that contains 20K tasks with trajectories of tool usage. Then, we develop the T3-Agent via \underline{T}rajectory \underline{T}uning on VLMs for \underline{T}ool usage using MM-Traj. Evaluations on the GTA and GAIA benchmarks show that the T3-Agent consistently achieves improvements on two popular VLMs: MiniCPM-V-8.5B and {Qwen2-VL-7B}, which outperforms untrained VLMs by $20\%$, showing the effectiveness of the proposed data synthesis pipeline, leading to high-quality data for tool-usage capabilities.</description>

      <title>On Computational Limits and Provably Efficient Criteria of Visual Autoregressive Models: A Fine-Grained Complexity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Visual Autoregressive ($\mathsf{VAR}$) Models introduced a groundbreaking advancement in the field of image generation, offering a scalable approach through a coarse-to-fine ``next-scale prediction'' paradigm. Suppose that $n$ represents the height and width of the last VQ code map generated by $\mathsf{VAR}$ models, the state-of-the-art algorithm in [Tian, Jiang, Yuan, Peng and Wang, NeurIPS 2024] takes $O(n^{4+o(1)})$ time, which is computationally inefficient. In this work, we analyze the computational limits and efficiency criteria of $\mathsf{VAR}$ Models through a fine-grained complexity lens. Our key contribution is identifying the conditions under which $\mathsf{VAR}$ computations can achieve sub-quadratic time complexity. We have proved that assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis ($\mathsf{SETH}$) from fine-grained complexity theory, a sub-quartic time algorithm for $\mathsf{VAR}$ models is impossible. To substantiate our theoretical findings, we present efficient constructions leveraging low-rank approximations that align with the derived criteria. This work initiates the study of the computational efficiency of the $\mathsf{VAR}$ model from a theoretical perspective. Our technique will shed light on advancing scalable and efficient image generation in $\mathsf{VAR}$ frameworks.</description>

      <title>On Disentangled Training for Nonlinear Transform in Learned Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has demonstrated superior rate-distortion (R-D) performance compared to traditional codecs, but is challenged by training inefficiency that could incur more than two weeks to train a state-of-the-art model from scratch. Existing LIC methods overlook the slow convergence caused by compacting energy in learning nonlinear transforms. In this paper, we first reveal that such energy compaction consists of two components, i.e., feature decorrelation and uneven energy modulation. On such basis, we propose a linear auxiliary transform (AuxT) to disentangle energy compaction in training nonlinear transforms. The proposed AuxT obtains coarse approximation to achieve efficient energy compaction such that distribution fitting with the nonlinear transforms can be simplified to fine details. We then develop wavelet-based linear shortcuts (WLSs) for AuxT that leverages wavelet-based downsampling and orthogonal linear projection for feature decorrelation and subband-aware scaling for uneven energy modulation. AuxT is lightweight and plug-and-play to be integrated into diverse LIC models to address the slow convergence issue. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accelerate training of LIC models by 2 times and simultaneously achieves an average 1\% BD-rate reduction. To our best knowledge, this is one of the first successful attempt that can significantly improve the convergence of LIC with comparable or superior rate-distortion performance. Code will be released at \url{https://github.com/qingshi9974/AuxT}</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lightweight deep learning approaches for malaria detection have gained attention for their potential to enhance diagnostics in resource constrained environments. For our study, we selected SqueezeNet1.1 as it is one of the most popular lightweight architectures. SqueezeNet1.1 is a later version of SqueezeNet1.0 and is 2.4 times more computationally efficient than the original model. We proposed and implemented three ultra-lightweight architecture variants to SqueezeNet1.1 architecture, namely Variant 1 (one fire module), Variant 2 (two fire modules), and Variant 3 (four fire modules), which are even more compact than SqueezeNetV1.1 (eight fire modules). These models were implemented to evaluate the best performing variant that achieves superior computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy in malaria blood cell classification. The models were trained and evaluated using the NIH Malaria dataset. We assessed each model's performance based on metrics including accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The results show that the SqueezeNet1.1 model achieves the highest performance across all metrics, with a classification accuracy of 97.12%. Variant 3 (four fire modules) offers a competitive alternative, delivering almost identical results (accuracy 96.55%) with a 6x reduction in computational overhead compared to SqueezeNet1.1. Variant 2 and Variant 1 perform slightly lower than Variant 3, with Variant 2 (two fire modules) reducing computational overhead by 28x, and Variant 1 (one fire module) achieving a 54x reduction in trainable parameters compared to SqueezeNet1.1. These findings demonstrate that our SqueezeNet1.1 architecture variants provide a flexible approach to malaria detection, enabling the selection of a variant that balances resource constraints and performance.</description>

Abstract: Pneumonia is a leading cause of illness and death in children, underscoring the need for early and accurate detection. In this study, we propose a novel lightweight ensemble model for detecting pneumonia in children using chest X-ray images. This ensemble model integrates two pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), MobileNetV2 and NASNetMobile, selected for their balance of computational efficiency and accuracy. These models were fine-tuned on a pediatric chest X-ray dataset and combined to enhance classification performance. Our proposed ensemble model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.63%, significantly outperforming individual models such as MobileNetV2 (97.10%) and NASNetMobile(96.25%) in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Moreover, the ensemble model outperformed state-of-the-art architectures, including ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet201, while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed lightweight ensemble model presents a highly effective and resource-efficient solution for pneumonia detection, making it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>Understanding Model Calibration -- A gentle introduction and visual exploration of calibration and the expected calibration error (ECE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To be considered reliable, a model must be calibrated so that its confidence in each decision closely reflects its true outcome. In this blogpost we'll take a look at the most commonly used definition for calibration and then dive into a frequently used evaluation measure for model calibration. We'll then cover some of the drawbacks of this measure and how these surfaced the need for additional notions of calibration, which require their own new evaluation measures. This post is not intended to be an in-depth dissection of all works on calibration, nor does it focus on how to calibrate models. Instead, it is meant to provide a gentle introduction to the different notions and their evaluation measures as well as to re-highlight some issues with a measure that is still widely used to evaluate calibration.</description>
