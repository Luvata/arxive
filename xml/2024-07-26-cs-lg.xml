      <title>Rapid Switching and Multi-Adapter Fusion via Sparse High Rank Adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Sparse High Rank Adapters (SHiRA) that directly finetune 1-2% of the base model weights while leaving others unchanged, thus, resulting in a highly sparse adapter. This high sparsity incurs no inference overhead, enables rapid switching directly in the fused mode, and significantly reduces concept-loss during multi-adapter fusion. Our extensive experiments on LVMs and LLMs demonstrate that finetuning merely 1-2% parameters in the base model is sufficient for many adapter tasks and significantly outperforms Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We also show that SHiRA is orthogonal to advanced LoRA methods such as DoRA and can be easily combined with existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Masked Graph Learning with Recurrent Alignment for Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (MERC) can be applied to public opinion monitoring, intelligent dialogue robots, and other fields, it has received extensive research attention in recent years. Unlike traditional unimodal emotion recognition, MERC can fuse complementary semantic information between multiple modalities (e.g., text, audio, and vision) to improve emotion recognition. However, previous work ignored the inter-modal alignment process and the intra-modal noise information before multimodal fusion but directly fuses multimodal features, which will hinder the model for representation learning. In this study, we have developed a novel approach called Masked Graph Learning with Recursive Alignment (MGLRA) to tackle this problem, which uses a recurrent iterative module with memory to align multimodal features, and then uses the masked GCN for multimodal feature fusion. First, we employ LSTM to capture contextual information and use a graph attention-filtering mechanism to eliminate noise effectively within the modality. Second, we build a recurrent iteration module with a memory function, which can use communication between different modalities to eliminate the gap between modalities and achieve the preliminary alignment of features between modalities. Then, a cross-modal multi-head attention mechanism is introduced to achieve feature alignment between modalities and construct a masked GCN for multimodal feature fusion, which can perform random mask reconstruction on the nodes in the graph to obtain better node feature representation. Finally, we utilize a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for emotion recognition. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., IEMOCAP and MELD) demonstrate that {MGLRA} outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Interval Forecasts for Gas Prices in the Face of Structural Breaks -- Statistical Models vs. Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable gas price forecasts are an essential information for gas and energy traders, for risk managers and also economists. However, ahead of the war in Ukraine Europe began to suffer from substantially increased and volatile gas prices which culminated in the aftermath of the North Stream 1 explosion. This shock changed both trend and volatility structure of the prices and has considerable effects on forecasting models. In this study we investigate whether modern machine learning methods such as neural networks are more resilient against such changes than statistical models such as autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models with conditional heteroskedasticity, or copula-based time series models. Thereby the focus lies on interval forecasting and applying respective evaluation measures. As data, the Front Month prices from the Dutch Title Transfer Facility, currently the predominant European exchange, are used. We see that, during the shock period, most models underestimate the variance while overestimating the variance in the after-shock period. Furthermore, we recognize that, during the shock, the simpler models, i.e. an ARMA model with conditional heteroskedasticity and the multilayer perceptron (a neural network), perform best with regards to prediction interval coverage. Interestingly, the widely-used long-short term neural network is outperformed by its competitors.</description>

      <title>Topology Reorganized Graph Contrastive Learning with Mitigating Semantic Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) is an effective paradigm for node representation learning in graphs. The key components hidden behind GCL are data augmentation and positive-negative pair selection. Typical data augmentations in GCL, such as uniform deletion of edges, are generally blind and resort to local perturbation, which is prone to producing under-diversity views. Additionally, there is a risk of making the augmented data traverse to other classes. Moreover, most methods always treat all other samples as negatives. Such a negative pairing naturally results in sampling bias and likewise may make the learned representation suffer from semantic drift. Therefore, to increase the diversity of the contrastive view, we propose two simple and effective global topological augmentations to compensate current GCL. One is to mine the semantic correlation between nodes in the feature space. The other is to utilize the algebraic properties of the adjacency matrix to characterize the topology by eigen-decomposition. With the help of both, we can retain important edges to build a better view. To reduce the risk of semantic drift, a prototype-based negative pair selection is further designed which can filter false negative samples. Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the advantages of the model compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>PateGail: A Privacy-Preserving Mobility Trajectory Generator with Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating human mobility trajectories is of great importance to solve the lack of large-scale trajectory data in numerous applications, which is caused by privacy concerns. However, existing mobility trajectory generation methods still require real-world human trajectories centrally collected as the training data, where there exists an inescapable risk of privacy leakage. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose PateGail, a privacy-preserving imitation learning model to generate mobility trajectories, which utilizes the powerful generative adversary imitation learning model to simulate the decision-making process of humans. Further, in order to protect user privacy, we train this model collectively based on decentralized mobility data stored in user devices, where personal discriminators are trained locally to distinguish and reward the real and generated human trajectories. In the training process, only the generated trajectories and their rewards obtained based on personal discriminators are shared between the server and devices, whose privacy is further preserved by our proposed perturbation mechanisms with theoretical proof to satisfy differential privacy. Further, to better model the human decision-making process, we propose a novel aggregation mechanism of the rewards obtained from personal discriminators. We theoretically prove that under the reward obtained based on the aggregation mechanism, our proposed model maximizes the lower bound of the discounted total rewards of users. Extensive experiments show that the trajectories generated by our model are able to resemble real-world trajectories in terms of five key statistical metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms by over 48.03%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the synthetic trajectories are able to efficiently support practical applications, including mobility prediction and location recommendation.</description>

      <title>Conformally Natural Families of Probability Distributions on Hyperbolic Disc with a View on Geometric Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the novel family of probability distributions on hyperbolic disc. The distinctive property of the proposed family is invariance under the actions of the group of disc-preserving conformal mappings. The group-invariance property renders it a convenient and tractable model for encoding uncertainties in hyperbolic data. Potential applications in Geometric Deep Learning and bioinformatics are numerous, some of them are briefly discussed. We also emphasize analogies with hyperbolic coherent states in quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Shallow Convex Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose Wasserstein distributionally robust shallow convex neural networks (WaDiRo-SCNNs) to provide reliable nonlinear predictions when subject to adverse and corrupted datasets. Our approach is based on a new convex training program for ReLU shallow neural networks which allows us to cast the problem as an exact, tractable reformulation of its order-1 Wasserstein distributionally robust equivalent. Our training procedure is conservative by design, has low stochasticity, is solvable with open-source solvers, and is scalable to large industrial deployments. We provide out-of-sample performance guarantees and show that hard convex physical constraints can be enforced in the training program. WaDiRo-SCNN aims to make neural networks safer for critical applications, such as in the energy sector. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the performance of our model on a synthetic experiment and a real-world power system application, i.e., the prediction of non-residential buildings' hourly energy consumption. The experimental results are convincing and showcase the strengths of the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Machine Learning in Mental Health: A Survey of Data, Algorithms, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of machine learning (ML) in detecting, diagnosing, and treating mental health disorders is garnering increasing attention. Traditionally, research has focused on single modalities, such as text from clinical notes, audio from speech samples, or video of interaction patterns. Recently, multimodal ML, which combines information from multiple modalities, has demonstrated significant promise in offering novel insights into human behavior patterns and recognizing mental health symptoms and risk factors. Despite its potential, multimodal ML in mental health remains an emerging field, facing several complex challenges before practical applications can be effectively developed. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the data availability and current state-of-the-art multimodal ML applications for mental health. It discusses key challenges that must be addressed to advance the field. The insights from this survey aim to deepen the understanding of the potential and limitations of multimodal ML in mental health, guiding future research and development in this evolving domain.</description>

      <title>In Search for Architectures and Loss Functions in Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) is essential for addressing the intricacies of real-world RL problems, which often require trade-offs between multiple utility functions. However, MORL is challenging due to unstable learning dynamics with deep learning-based function approximators. The research path most taken has been to explore different value-based loss functions for MORL to overcome this issue. Our work empirically explores model-free policy learning loss functions and the impact of different architectural choices. We introduce two different approaches: Multi-objective Proximal Policy Optimization (MOPPO), which extends PPO to MORL, and Multi-objective Advantage Actor Critic (MOA2C), which acts as a simple baseline in our ablations. Our proposed approach is straightforward to implement, requiring only small modifications at the level of function approximator. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on the MORL Deep Sea Treasure, Minecart, and Reacher environments and show that MOPPO effectively captures the Pareto front. Our extensive ablation studies and empirical analyses reveal the impact of different architectural choices, underscoring the robustness and versatility of MOPPO compared to popular MORL approaches like Pareto Conditioned Networks (PCN) and Envelope Q-learning in terms of MORL metrics, including hypervolume and expected utility.</description>

      <title>Balanced Multi-Relational Graph Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-relational graph clustering has demonstrated remarkable success in uncovering underlying patterns in complex networks. Representative methods manage to align different views motivated by advances in contrastive learning. Our empirical study finds the pervasive presence of imbalance in real-world graphs, which is in principle contradictory to the motivation of alignment. In this paper, we first propose a novel metric, the Aggregation Class Distance, to empirically quantify structural disparities among different graphs. To address the challenge of view imbalance, we propose Balanced Multi-Relational Graph Clustering (BMGC), comprising unsupervised dominant view mining and dual signals guided representation learning. It dynamically mines the dominant view throughout the training process, synergistically improving clustering performance with representation learning. Theoretical analysis ensures the effectiveness of dominant view mining. Extensive experiments and in-depth analysis on real-world and synthetic datasets showcase that BMGC achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its superiority in addressing the view imbalance inherent in multi-relational graphs. The source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/zxlearningdeep/BMGC.</description>

      <title>How Can Deep Neural Networks Fail Even With Global Optima?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully connected deep neural networks are successfully applied to classification and function approximation problems. By minimizing the cost function, i.e., finding the proper weights and biases, models can be built for accurate predictions. The ideal optimization process can achieve global optima. However, do global optima always perform well? If not, how bad can it be? In this work, we aim to: 1) extend the expressive power of shallow neural networks to networks of any depth using a simple trick, 2) construct extremely overfitting deep neural networks that, despite having global optima, still fail to perform well on classification and function approximation problems. Different types of activation functions are considered, including ReLU, Parametric ReLU, and Sigmoid functions. Extensive theoretical analysis has been conducted, ranging from one-dimensional models to models of any dimensionality. Numerical results illustrate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Regulating AI Adaptation: An Analysis of AI Medical Device Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the pace of development of AI has rapidly progressed in recent years, the implementation of safe and effective regulatory frameworks has lagged behind. In particular, the adaptive nature of AI models presents unique challenges to regulators as updating a model can improve its performance but also introduce safety risks. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been a forerunner in regulating and approving hundreds of AI medical devices. To better understand how AI is updated and its regulatory considerations, we systematically analyze the frequency and nature of updates in FDA-approved AI medical devices. We find that less than 2% of all devices report having been updated by being re-trained on new data. Meanwhile, nearly a quarter of devices report updates in the form of new functionality and marketing claims. As an illustrative case study, we analyze pneumothorax detection models and find that while model performance can degrade by as much as 0.18 AUC when evaluated on new sites, re-training on site-specific data can mitigate this performance drop, recovering up to 0.23 AUC. However, we also observed significant degradation on the original site after re-training using data from new sites, providing insight from one example that challenges the current one-model-fits-all approach to regulatory approvals. Our analysis provides an in-depth look at the current state of FDA-approved AI device updates and insights for future regulatory policies toward model updating and adaptive AI.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Policy Transfer by Representation Alignment via Multi-Domain Behavioral Cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transferring learned skills across diverse situations remains a fundamental challenge for autonomous agents, particularly when agents are not allowed to interact with an exact target setup. While prior approaches have predominantly focused on learning domain translation, they often struggle with handling significant domain gaps or out-of-distribution tasks. In this paper, we present a simple approach for cross-domain policy transfer that learns a shared latent representation across domains and a common abstract policy on top of it. Our approach leverages multi-domain behavioral cloning on unaligned trajectories of proxy tasks and employs maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as a regularization term to encourage cross-domain alignment. The MMD regularization better preserves structures of latent state distributions than commonly used domain-discriminative distribution matching, leading to higher transfer performance. Moreover, our approach involves training only one multi-domain policy, which makes extension easier than existing methods. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our method across various domain shifts, especially in scenarios where exact domain translation is challenging, such as cross-morphology or cross-viewpoint settings. Our ablation studies further reveal that multi-domain behavioral cloning implicitly contributes to representation alignment alongside domain-adversarial regularization.</description>

      <title>GV-Rep: A Large-Scale Dataset for Genetic Variant Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genetic variants (GVs) are defined as differences in the DNA sequences among individuals and play a crucial role in diagnosing and treating genetic diseases. The rapid decrease in next generation sequencing cost has led to an exponential increase in patient-level GV data. This growth poses a challenge for clinicians who must efficiently prioritize patient-specific GVs and integrate them with existing genomic databases to inform patient management. To addressing the interpretation of GVs, genomic foundation models (GFMs) have emerged. However, these models lack standardized performance assessments, leading to considerable variability in model evaluations. This poses the question: How effectively do deep learning methods classify unknown GVs and align them with clinically-verified GVs? We argue that representation learning, which transforms raw data into meaningful feature spaces, is an effective approach for addressing both indexing and classification challenges. We introduce a large-scale Genetic Variant dataset, named GV-Rep, featuring variable-length contexts and detailed annotations, designed for deep learning models to learn GV representations across various traits, diseases, tissue types, and experimental contexts. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) Construction of a comprehensive dataset with 7 million records, each labeled with characteristics of the corresponding variants, alongside additional data from 17,548 gene knockout tests across 1,107 cell types, 1,808 variant combinations, and 156 unique clinically verified GVs from real-world patients. (ii) Analysis of the structure and properties of the dataset. (iii) Experimentation of the dataset with pre-trained GFMs. The results show a significant gap between GFMs current capabilities and accurate GV representation. We hope this dataset will help advance genomic deep learning to bridge this gap.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Gradient Regularization Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizer plays an important role in neural network training with high efficiency and performance. Weight update based on its gradient is the central part of the optimizer. It has been shown that normalization and standardization operation on weight and gradient can accelerate the training process and improve performance such as Weight Standardization (WS), weight normalization (WN) and gradient normalization (GN); there is also gradient centralization (GC). In this work, we introduce a new optimization technique based on the gradient magnitude in a gradient vector named adaptive gradient regularization (AGR), which normalizes the gradient vector in all dimensions as a coefficient vector and subtracts the product of the gradient and its coefficient vector by the vanilla gradient. It can be viewed as an adaptive gradient clipping method. We show that the AGR can improve the loss function Lipschitzness with a more stable training process and better generalization performance. AGR is very simple to be embedded into vanilla optimizers such as Adan and AdamW with only three lines of code. Our experiments are conducted in image generation, image classification and language representation, which shows that our AGR improves the training result.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that, relative position encoding performs well in selective state space model scanning algorithms, and the architecture that balances SSM and Attention enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm, while the sparse activation of the mixture of experts reduces the training cost. I studied the effectiveness of using different position encodings in structured state space dual algorithms, and the more effective SSD-Attn internal and external function mixing method, and designed a more efficient cross domain mixture of experts. I found that the same matrix is very wonderful in different algorithms, which allows us to establish a new hybrid sparse architecture: Cheems. Compared with other hybrid architectures, it is more efficient and more effective in language modeling tasks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Graph Transformer with Correlated Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning effective representations for Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs (CTDGs) has garnered significant research interest, largely due to its powerful capabilities in modeling complex interactions between nodes. A fundamental and crucial requirement for representation learning in CTDGs is the appropriate estimation and preservation of proximity. However, due to the sparse and evolving characteristics of CTDGs, the spatial-temporal properties inherent in high-order proximity remain largely unexplored. Despite its importance, this property presents significant challenges due to the computationally intensive nature of personalized interaction intensity estimation and the dynamic attributes of CTDGs. To this end, we propose a novel Correlated Spatial-Temporal Positional encoding that incorporates a parameter-free personalized interaction intensity estimation under the weak assumption of the Poisson Point Process. Building on this, we introduce the Dynamic Graph Transformer with \Correlated Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding (CorDGT), which efficiently retains the evolving spatial-temporal high-order proximity for effective node representation learning in CTDGs. Extensive experiments on seven small and two large-scale datasets demonstrate the superior performance and scalability of the proposed CorDGT.</description>

      <title>On the Parameter Identifiability of Partially Observed Linear Causal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear causal models are important tools for modeling causal dependencies and yet in practice, only a subset of the variables can be observed. In this paper, we examine the parameter identifiability of these models by investigating whether the edge coefficients can be recovered given the causal structure and partially observed data. Our setting is more general than that of prior research - we allow all variables, including both observed and latent ones, to be flexibly related, and we consider the coefficients of all edges, whereas most existing works focus only on the edges between observed variables. Theoretically, we identify three types of indeterminacy for the parameters in partially observed linear causal models. We then provide graphical conditions that are sufficient for all parameters to be identifiable and show that some of them are provably necessary. Methodologically, we propose a novel likelihood-based parameter estimation method that addresses the variance indeterminacy of latent variables in a specific way and can asymptotically recover the underlying parameters up to trivial indeterminacy. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our identifiability theory and the effectiveness of the proposed method in the finite-sample regime.</description>

      <title>scGHSOM: Hierarchical clustering and visualization of single-cell and CRISPR data using growing hierarchical SOM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional single-cell data poses significant challenges in identifying underlying biological patterns due to the complexity and heterogeneity of cellular states. We propose a comprehensive gene-cell dependency visualization via unsupervised clustering, Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map (GHSOM), specifically designed for analyzing high-dimensional single-cell data like single-cell sequencing and CRISPR screens. GHSOM is applied to cluster samples in a hierarchical structure such that the self-growth structure of clusters satisfies the required variations between and within. We propose a novel Significant Attributes Identification Algorithm to identify features that distinguish clusters. This algorithm pinpoints attributes with minimal variation within a cluster but substantial variation between clusters. These key attributes can then be used for targeted data retrieval and downstream analysis. Furthermore, we present two innovative visualization tools: Cluster Feature Map and Cluster Distribution Map. The Cluster Feature Map highlights the distribution of specific features across the hierarchical structure of GHSOM clusters. This allows for rapid visual assessment of cluster uniqueness based on chosen features. The Cluster Distribution Map depicts leaf clusters as circles on the GHSOM grid, with circle size reflecting cluster data size and color customizable to visualize features like cell type or other attributes. We apply our analysis to three single-cell datasets and one CRISPR dataset (cell-gene database) and evaluate clustering methods with internal and external CH and ARI scores. GHSOM performs well, being the best performer in internal evaluation (CH=4.2). In external evaluation, GHSOM has the third-best performance of all methods.</description>

      <title>Sparse Tensor PCA via Tensor Decomposition for Unsupervised Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, introducing Tensor Decomposition (TD) methods into unsupervised feature selection (UFS) has been a rising research point. A tensor structure is beneficial for mining the relations between different modes and helps relieve the computation burden. However, while existing methods exploit TD to minimize the reconstruction error of a data tensor, they don't fully utilize the interpretable and discriminative information in the factor matrices. Moreover, most methods require domain knowledge to perform feature selection. To solve the above problems, we develop two Sparse Tensor Principal Component Analysis (STPCA) models that utilize the projection directions in the factor matrices to perform UFS. The first model extends Tucker Decomposition to a multiview sparse regression form and is transformed into several alternatively solved convex subproblems. The second model formulates a sparse version of the family of Tensor Singular Value Decomposition (T-SVDs) and is transformed into individual convex subproblems. For both models, we prove the optimal solution of each subproblem falls onto the Hermitian Positive Semidefinite Cone (HPSD). Accordingly, we design two fast algorithms based on HPSD projection and prove their convergence. According to the experimental results on two original synthetic datasets (Orbit and Array Signal) and five real-world datasets, the two proposed methods are suitable for handling different data tensor scenarios and outperform the state-of-the-art UFS methods.</description>

      <title>SepsisLab: Early Sepsis Prediction with Uncertainty Quantification and Active Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sepsis is the leading cause of in-hospital mortality in the USA. Early sepsis onset prediction and diagnosis could significantly improve the survival of sepsis patients. Existing predictive models are usually trained on high-quality data with few missing information, while missing values widely exist in real-world clinical scenarios (especially in the first hours of admissions to the hospital), which causes a significant decrease in accuracy and an increase in uncertainty for the predictive models. The common method to handle missing values is imputation, which replaces the unavailable variables with estimates from the observed data. The uncertainty of imputation results can be propagated to the sepsis prediction outputs, which have not been studied in existing works on either sepsis prediction or uncertainty quantification. In this study, we first define such propagated uncertainty as the variance of prediction output and then introduce uncertainty propagation methods to quantify the propagated uncertainty. Moreover, for the potential high-risk patients with low confidence due to limited observations, we propose a robust active sensing algorithm to increase confidence by actively recommending clinicians to observe the most informative variables. We validate the proposed models in both publicly available data (i.e., MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb) and proprietary data in The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). The experimental results show that the propagated uncertainty is dominant at the beginning of admissions to hospitals and the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art active sensing methods. Finally, we implement a SepsisLab system for early sepsis prediction and active sensing based on our pre-trained models. Clinicians and potential sepsis patients can benefit from the system in early prediction and diagnosis of sepsis.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Efficient Fine-Tuning of Quantized Large Language Models Through Optimal Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various domains. However, the enormous number of model parameters makes fine-tuning challenging, significantly limiting their application and deployment. Existing solutions combine parameter quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), greatly reducing memory usage but resulting in noticeable performance degradation. In this paper, we identify an imbalance in fine-tuning quantized pre-trained models: overly complex adapter inputs and outputs versus low effective trainability of the adaptation. We propose Quantized LLMs with Balanced-rank Adaptation (Q-BaRA), which simplifies the adapter inputs and outputs while increasing the adapter's rank to achieve a more suitable balance for fine-tuning quantized LLMs. Additionally, for scenarios where fine-tuned LLMs need to be deployed as low-precision inference models, we introduce Quantization-Aware Fine-tuning with Higher Rank Adaptation (QA-HiRA), which simplifies the adapter inputs and outputs to align with the pre-trained model's block-wise quantization while employing a single matrix to achieve a higher rank. Both Q-BaRA and QA-HiRA are easily implemented and offer the following optimizations: (i) Q-BaRA consistently achieves the highest accuracy compared to baselines and other variants, requiring the same number of trainable parameters and computational effort; (ii) QA-HiRA naturally merges adapter parameters into the block-wise quantized model after fine-tuning, achieving the highest accuracy compared to other methods. We apply our Q-BaRA and QA-HiRA to the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model families and validate their effectiveness across different fine-tuning datasets and downstream scenarios.

      <title>Sparse Inducing Points in Deep Gaussian Processes: Enhancing Modeling with Denoising Diffusion Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) provide a robust paradigm for Bayesian deep learning. In DGPs, a set of sparse integration locations called inducing points are selected to approximate the posterior distribution of the model. This is done to reduce computational complexity and improve model efficiency. However, inferring the posterior distribution of inducing points is not straightforward. Traditional variational inference approaches to posterior approximation often lead to significant bias. To address this issue, we propose an alternative method called Denoising Diffusion Variational Inference (DDVI) that uses a denoising diffusion stochastic differential equation (SDE) to generate posterior samples of inducing variables. We rely on score matching methods for denoising diffusion model to approximate score functions with a neural network. Furthermore, by combining classical mathematical theory of SDEs with the minimization of KL divergence between the approximate and true processes, we propose a novel explicit variational lower bound for the marginal likelihood function of DGP. Through experiments on various datasets and comparisons with baseline methods, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of DDVI for posterior inference of inducing points for DGP models.</description>

      <title>Time Series Missing Imputation with Multivariate Radial Basis Function Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers have been persistently working to address the issue of missing values in time series data. Numerous models have been proposed, striving to estimate the distribution of the data. The Radial Basis Functions Neural Network (RBFNN) has recently exhibited exceptional performance in estimating data distribution. In this paper, we propose a time series imputation model based on RBFNN. Our imputation model learns local information from timestamps to create a continuous function. Additionally, we incorporate time gaps to facilitate learning information considering the missing terms of missing values. We name this model the Missing Imputation Multivariate RBFNN (MIM-RBFNN). However, MIM-RBFNN relies on a local information-based learning approach, which presents difficulties in utilizing temporal information. Therefore, we propose an extension called the Missing Value Imputation Recurrent Neural Network with Continuous Function (MIRNN-CF) using the continuous function generated by MIM-RBFNN. We evaluate the performance using two real-world datasets with non-random missing and random missing patterns, and conduct an ablation study comparing MIM-RBFNN and MIRNN-CF.</description>

      <title>Curriculum Negative Mining For Temporal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal networks are effective in capturing the evolving interactions of networks over time, such as social networks and e-commerce networks. In recent years, researchers have primarily concentrated on developing specific model architectures for Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) in order to improve the representation quality of temporal nodes and edges. However, limited attention has been given to the quality of negative samples during the training of TGNNs. When compared with static networks, temporal networks present two specific challenges for negative sampling: positive sparsity and positive shift. Positive sparsity refers to the presence of a single positive sample amidst numerous negative samples at each timestamp, while positive shift relates to the variations in positive samples across different timestamps. To robustly address these challenges in training TGNNs, we introduce Curriculum Negative Mining (CurNM), a model-aware curriculum learning framework that adaptively adjusts the difficulty of negative samples. Within this framework, we first establish a dynamically updated negative pool that balances random, historical, and hard negatives to address the challenges posed by positive sparsity. Secondly, we implement a temporal-aware negative selection module that focuses on learning from the disentangled factors of recently active edges, thus accurately capturing shifting preferences. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets and 3 TGNNs demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin. Additionally, thorough ablation studies and parameter sensitivity experiments verify the usefulness and robustness of our approach.

      <title>Contrastive Learning Is Not Optimal for Quasiperiodic Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for time series analysis, a noticeable gap persists between the anticipated achievements and actual performance. While these methods have demonstrated formidable generalization capabilities with minimal labels in various domains, their effectiveness in distinguishing between different classes based on a limited number of annotated records is notably lacking. Our hypothesis attributes this bottleneck to the prevalent use of Contrastive Learning, a shared training objective in previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. By mandating distinctiveness between representations for negative pairs drawn from separate records, this approach compels the model to encode unique record-based patterns but simultaneously neglects changes occurring across the entire record. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Distilled Embedding for Almost-Periodic Time Series (DEAPS) in this paper, offering a non-contrastive method tailored for quasiperiodic time series, such as electrocardiogram (ECG) data. By avoiding the use of negative pairs, we not only mitigate the model's blindness to temporal changes but also enable the integration of a "Gradual Loss (Lgra)" function. This function guides the model to effectively capture dynamic patterns evolving throughout the record. The outcomes are promising, as DEAPS demonstrates a notable improvement of +10% over existing SOTA methods when just a few annotated records are presented to fit a Machine Learning (ML) model based on the learned representation.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Knowledge Tracing Models via k-Sparse Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) is the problem of predicting students' future performance based on their historical interaction sequences. With the advanced capability of capturing contextual long-term dependency, attention mechanism becomes one of the essential components in many deep learning based KT (DLKT) models. In spite of the impressive performance achieved by these attentional DLKT models, many of them are often vulnerable to run the risk of overfitting, especially on small-scale educational datasets. Therefore, in this paper, we propose \textsc{sparseKT}, a simple yet effective framework to improve the robustness and generalization of the attention based DLKT approaches. Specifically, we incorporate a k-selection module to only pick items with the highest attention scores. We propose two sparsification heuristics : (1) soft-thresholding sparse attention and (2) top-$K$ sparse attention. We show that our \textsc{sparseKT} is able to help attentional KT models get rid of irrelevant student interactions and have comparable predictive performance when compared to 11 state-of-the-art KT models on three publicly available real-world educational datasets. To encourage reproducible research, we make our data and code publicly available at \url{https://github.com/pykt-team/pykt-toolkit}\footnote{We merged our model to the \textsc{pyKT} benchmark at \url{https://pykt.org/}.}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextual dueling bandit is used to model the bandit problems, where a learner's goal is to find the best arm for a given context using observed noisy preference feedback over the selected arms for the past contexts. However, existing algorithms assume the reward function is linear, which can be complex and non-linear in many real-life applications like online recommendations or ranking web search results. To overcome this challenge, we use a neural network to estimate the reward function using preference feedback for the previously selected arms. We propose upper confidence bound- and Thompson sampling-based algorithms with sub-linear regret guarantees that efficiently select arms in each round. We then extend our theoretical results to contextual bandit problems with binary feedback, which is in itself a non-trivial contribution. Experimental results on the problem instances derived from synthetic datasets corroborate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>EverAdapt: Continuous Adaptation for Dynamic Machine Fault Diagnosis Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has emerged as a key solution in data-driven fault diagnosis, addressing domain shift where models underperform in changing environments. However, under the realm of continually changing environments, UDA tends to underperform on previously seen domains when adapting to new ones - a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this limitation, we introduce the EverAdapt framework, specifically designed for continuous model adaptation in dynamic environments. Central to EverAdapt is a novel Continual Batch Normalization (CBN), which leverages source domain statistics as a reference point to standardize feature representations across domains. EverAdapt not only retains statistical information from previous domains but also adapts effectively to new scenarios. Complementing CBN, we design a class-conditional domain alignment module for effective integration of target domains, and a Sample-efficient Replay strategy to reinforce memory retention. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate EverAdapt superiority in maintaining robust fault diagnosis in dynamic environments.

      <title>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Continual Learning: A Neural Tangent Kernel Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning for continual learning (PEFT-CL) has shown promise in adapting pre-trained models to sequential tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting problem. However, understanding the mechanisms that dictate continual performance in this paradigm remains elusive. To tackle this complexity, we undertake a rigorous analysis of PEFT-CL dynamics to derive relevant metrics for continual scenarios using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory. With the aid of NTK as a mathematical analysis tool, we recast the challenge of test-time forgetting into the quantifiable generalization gaps during training, identifying three key factors that influence these gaps and the performance of PEFT-CL: training sample size, task-level feature orthogonality, and regularization. To address these challenges, we introduce NTK-CL, a novel framework that eliminates task-specific parameter storage while adaptively generating task-relevant features. Aligning with theoretical guidance, NTK-CL triples the feature representation of each sample, theoretically and empirically reducing the magnitude of both task-interplay and task-specific generalization gaps. Grounded in NTK analysis, our approach imposes an adaptive exponential moving average mechanism and constraints on task-level feature orthogonality, maintaining intra-task NTK forms while attenuating inter-task NTK forms. Ultimately, by fine-tuning optimizable parameters with appropriate regularization, NTK-CL achieves state-of-the-art performance on established PEFT-CL benchmarks. This work provides a theoretical foundation for understanding and improving PEFT-CL models, offering insights into the interplay between feature representation, task orthogonality, and generalization, contributing to the development of more efficient continual learning systems.</description>

      <title>Path Following and Stabilisation of a Bicycle Model using a Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the years, complex control approaches have been developed to control the motion of a bicycle. Reinforcement Learning (RL), a branch of machine learning, promises easy deployment of so-called agents. Deployed agents are increasingly considered as an alternative to controllers for mechanical systems. The present work introduces an RL approach to do path following with a virtual bicycle model while simultaneously stabilising it laterally. The bicycle, modelled as the Whipple benchmark model and using multibody system dynamics, has no stabilisation aids. The agent succeeds in both path following and stabilisation of the bicycle model exclusively by outputting steering angles, which are converted into steering torques via a PD controller. Curriculum learning is applied as a state-of-the-art training strategy. Different settings for the implemented RL framework are investigated and compared to each other. The performance of the deployed agents is evaluated using different types of paths and measurements. The ability of the deployed agents to do path following and stabilisation of the bicycle model travelling between 2m/s and 7m/s along complex paths including full circles, slalom manoeuvres, and lane changes is demonstrated. Explanatory methods for machine learning are used to analyse the functionality of a deployed agent and link the introduced RL approach with research in the field of bicycle dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing have positioned it as a prospective solution for tackling intricate computational challenges, with supervised learning emerging as a promising domain for its application. Despite this potential, the field of quantum machine learning is still in its early stages, and there persists a level of skepticism regarding a possible near-term quantum advantage. This paper aims to provide a classical perspective on current quantum algorithms for supervised learning, effectively bridging traditional machine learning principles with advancements in quantum machine learning. Specifically, this study charts a research trajectory that diverges from the predominant focus of quantum machine learning literature, originating from the prerequisites of classical methodologies and elucidating the potential impact of quantum approaches. Through this exploration, our objective is to deepen the understanding of the convergence between classical and quantum methods, thereby laying the groundwork for future advancements in both domains and fostering the involvement of classical practitioners in the field of quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>dlordinal: a Python package for deep ordinal classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: dlordinal is a new Python library that unifies many recent deep ordinal classification methodologies available in the literature. Developed using PyTorch as underlying framework, it implements the top performing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for ordinal classification problems. Ordinal approaches are designed to leverage the ordering information present in the target variable. Specifically, it includes loss functions, various output layers, dropout techniques, soft labelling methodologies, and other classification strategies, all of which are appropriately designed to incorporate the ordinal information. Furthermore, as the performance metrics to assess novel proposals in ordinal classification depend on the distance between target and predicted classes in the ordinal scale, suitable ordinal evaluation metrics are also included. dlordinal is distributed under the BSD-3-Clause license and is available at https://github.com/ayrna/dlordinal.</description>

      <title>Robust Deep Hawkes Process under Label Noise of Both Event and Occurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating deep neural networks with the Hawkes process has significantly improved predictive capabilities in finance, health informatics, and information technology. Nevertheless, these models often face challenges in real-world settings, particularly due to substantial label noise. This issue is of significant concern in the medical field, where label noise can arise from delayed updates in electronic medical records or misdiagnoses, leading to increased prediction risks. Our research indicates that deep Hawkes process models exhibit reduced robustness when dealing with label noise, particularly when it affects both event types and timing. To address these challenges, we first investigate the influence of label noise in approximated intensity functions and present a novel framework, the Robust Deep Hawkes Process (RDHP), to overcome the impact of label noise on the intensity function of Hawkes models, considering both the events and their occurrences. We tested RDHP using multiple open-source benchmarks with synthetic noise and conducted a case study on obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) in a real-world setting with inherent label noise. The results demonstrate that RDHP can effectively perform classification and regression tasks, even in the presence of noise related to events and their timing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to successfully address both event and time label noise in deep Hawkes process models, offering a promising solution for medical applications, specifically in diagnosing OSAHS.</description>

      <title>Explainable Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Irregular Temporal Classification of Multidrug Resistance Acquisition in Intensive Care Unit Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antimicrobial Resistance represents a significant challenge in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), where patients are at heightened risk of Multidrug-Resistant (MDR) infections-pathogens resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents. This study introduces a novel methodology that integrates Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) with advanced intrinsic and post-hoc interpretability techniques for detecting the onset of MDR in patients across time. Within interpretability methods, we propose Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approaches to handle irregular Multivariate Time Series (MTS), introducing Irregular Time Shapley Additive Explanations (IT-SHAP), a modification of Shapley Additive Explanations designed for irregular MTS with Recurrent Neural Networks focused on temporal outputs. Our methodology aims to identify specific risk factors associated with MDR in ICU patients. GRU with Hadamard's attention demonstrated high initial specificity and increasing sensitivity over time, correlating with increased nosocomial infection risks during prolonged ICU stays. XAI analysis, enhanced by Hadamard attention and IT-SHAP, identified critical factors such as previous non-resistant cultures, specific antibiotic usage patterns, and hospital environment dynamics. These insights suggest that early detection of at-risk patients can inform interventions such as preventive isolation and customized treatments, significantly improving clinical outcomes. The proposed GRU model for temporal classification achieved an average Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve of 78.27 +- 1.26 over time, indicating strong predictive performance. In summary, this study highlights the clinical utility of our methodology, which combines predictive accuracy with interpretability, thereby facilitating more effective healthcare interventions by professionals.</description>

      <title>Solving the Electrical Impedance Tomography Problem with a DeepONet Type Neural Network: Theory and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the non-invasive medical imaging modality of Electrical Impedance Tomography, where the problem is to recover the conductivity in a medium from a set of data that arises out of a current-to-voltage map (Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator) defined on the boundary of the medium. We formulate this inverse problem as an operator-learning problem where the goal is to learn the implicitly defined operator-to-function map between the space of Neumann-to-Dirichlet operators to the space of admissible conductivities. Subsequently, we use an operator-learning architecture, popularly called DeepONets, to learn this operator-to-function map. Thus far, most of the operator learning architectures have been implemented to learn operators between function spaces. In this work, we generalize the earlier works and use a DeepONet to actually {learn an operator-to-function} map. We provide a Universal Approximation Theorem type result which guarantees that this implicitly defined operator-to-function map between the space of Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator to the space of conductivity function can be approximated to an arbitrary degree using such a DeepONet. Furthermore, we provide a computational implementation of our proposed approach and compare it against a standard baseline. We show that the proposed approach achieves good reconstructions and outperforms the baseline method in our experiments.</description>

      <title>Take a Step and Reconsider: Sequence Decoding for Self-Improved Neural Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The constructive approach within Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) treats a combinatorial optimization problem as a finite Markov decision process, where solutions are built incrementally through a sequence of decisions guided by a neural policy network. To train the policy, recent research is shifting toward a 'self-improved' learning methodology that addresses the limitations of reinforcement learning and supervised approaches. Here, the policy is iteratively trained in a supervised manner, with solutions derived from the current policy serving as pseudo-labels. The way these solutions are obtained from the policy determines the quality of the pseudo-labels. In this paper, we present a simple and problem-independent sequence decoding method for self-improved learning based on sampling sequences without replacement. We incrementally follow the best solution found and repeat the sampling process from intermediate partial solutions. By modifying the policy to ignore previously sampled sequences, we force it to consider only unseen alternatives, thereby increasing solution diversity. Experimental results for the Traveling Salesman and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem demonstrate its strong performance. Furthermore, our method outperforms previous NCO approaches on the Job Shop Scheduling Problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning frameworks have become powerful tools for approaching scientific problems such as turbulent flow, which has wide-ranging applications. In practice, however, existing scientific machine learning approaches have difficulty fitting complex, multi-scale dynamical systems to very high precision, as required in scientific contexts. We propose using the novel multistage neural network approach with a spectrum-informed initialization to learn the residue from the previous stage, utilizing the spectral biases associated with neural networks to capture high frequency features in the residue, and successfully tackle the spectral bias of neural networks. This approach allows the neural network to fit target functions to double floating-point machine precision $O(10^{-16})$.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Regret for An Actor-Critic Algorithm in Continuous-Time Linear-Quadratic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of continuous-time linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems for diffusions where volatility of the state processes depends on both state and control variables. We apply a model-free approach that relies neither on knowledge of model parameters nor on their estimations, and devise an actor-critic algorithm to learn the optimal policy parameter directly. Our main contributions include the introduction of a novel exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one, and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(N^{\frac{3}{4}})$ up to a logarithmic factor. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm. We also perform numerical comparisons between our method and those of the recent model-based stochastic LQ RL studies adapted to the state- and control-dependent volatility setting, demonstrating a better performance of the former in terms of regret bounds.</description>

      <title>Channel-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation in Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The balance between model capacity and generalization has been a key focus of recent discussions in long-term time series forecasting. Two representative channel strategies are closely associated with model expressivity and robustness, including channel independence (CI) and channel dependence (CD). The former adopts individual channel treatment and has been shown to be more robust to distribution shifts, but lacks sufficient capacity to model meaningful channel interactions. The latter is more expressive for representing complex cross-channel dependencies, but is prone to overfitting. To balance the two strategies, we present a channel-aware low-rank adaptation method to condition CD models on identity-aware individual components. As a plug-in solution, it is adaptable for a wide range of backbone architectures. Extensive experiments show that it can consistently and significantly improve the performance of both CI and CD models with demonstrated efficiency and flexibility.

      <title>A Novel Two-Step Fine-Tuning Pipeline for Cold-Start Active Learning in Text Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first work to investigate the effectiveness of BERT-based contextual embeddings in active learning (AL) tasks on cold-start scenarios, where traditional fine-tuning is infeasible due to the absence of labeled data. Our primary contribution is the proposal of a more robust fine-tuning pipeline - DoTCAL - that diminishes the reliance on labeled data in AL using two steps: (1) fully leveraging unlabeled data through domain adaptation of the embeddings via masked language modeling and (2) further adjusting model weights using labeled data selected by AL. Our evaluation contrasts BERT-based embeddings with other prevalent text representation paradigms, including Bag of Words (BoW), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), and FastText, at two critical stages of the AL process: instance selection and classification. Experiments conducted on eight ATC benchmarks with varying AL budgets (number of labeled instances) and number of instances (about 5,000 to 300,000) demonstrate DoTCAL's superior effectiveness, achieving up to a 33% improvement in Macro-F1 while reducing labeling efforts by half compared to the traditional one-step method. We also found that in several tasks, BoW and LSI (due to information aggregation) produce results superior (up to 59% ) to BERT, especially in low-budget scenarios and hard-to-classify tasks, which is quite surprising.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces MoveLight, a novel traffic signal control system that enhances urban traffic management through movement-centric deep reinforcement learning. By leveraging detailed real-time data and advanced machine learning techniques, MoveLight overcomes the limitations of traditional traffic signal control methods. It employs a lane-level control approach using the FRAP algorithm to achieve dynamic and adaptive traffic signal control, optimizing traffic flow, reducing congestion, and improving overall efficiency. Our research demonstrates the scalability and effectiveness of MoveLight across single intersections, arterial roads, and network levels. Experimental results using real-world datasets from Cologne and Hangzhou show significant improvements in metrics such as queue length, delay, and throughput compared to existing methods. This study highlights the transformative potential of deep reinforcement learning in intelligent traffic signal control, setting a new standard for sustainable and efficient urban transportation systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the Global and Local Confidence Graph Neural Network (GLC-GNN), an innovative approach to graph-based anomaly detection that addresses the challenges of heterophily and camouflage in fraudulent activities. By introducing a prototype to encapsulate the global features of a graph and calculating a Global Confidence (GC) value for each node, GLC-GNN effectively distinguishes between benign and fraudulent nodes. The model leverages GC to generate attention values for message aggregation, enhancing its ability to capture both homophily and heterophily. Through extensive experiments on four open datasets, GLC-GNN demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models in accuracy and convergence speed, while maintaining a compact model size and expedited training process. The integration of global and local confidence measures in GLC-GNN offers a robust solution for detecting anomalies in graphs, with significant implications for fraud detection across diverse domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-precision formats such as float8 have been introduced in machine learning accelerated hardware to improve computational efficiency for large language models training and inference. Nevertheless, adoption by the ML community has been slowed down by the complex, and sometimes brittle, techniques required to match higher precision training accuracy. In this work, we present Scalify, a end-to-end scale propagation paradigm for computational graphs, generalizing and formalizing existing tensor scaling methods. Experiment results show that Scalify supports out-of-the-box float8 matrix multiplication and gradients representation, as well as float16 optimizer state storage. Our JAX implementation of Scalify is open-sourced at https://github.com/graphcore-research/jax-scalify</description>

      <title>Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans and many animals show remarkably adaptive behavior and can respond differently to the same input depending on their internal goals. The brain not only represents the intermediate abstractions needed to perform a computation but also actively maintains a representation of the computation itself (task abstraction). Such separation of the computation and its abstraction is associated with faster learning, flexible decision-making, and broad generalization capacity. We investigate if such benefits might extend to neural networks trained with task abstractions. For such benefits to emerge, one needs a task inference mechanism that possesses two crucial abilities: First, the ability to infer abstract task representations when no longer explicitly provided (task inference), and second, manipulate task representations to adapt to novel problems (task recomposition). To tackle this, we cast task inference as an optimization problem from a variational inference perspective and ground our approach in an expectation-maximization framework. We show that gradients backpropagated through a neural network to a task representation layer are an efficient heuristic to infer current task demands, a process we refer to as gradient-based inference (GBI). Further iterative optimization of the task representation layer allows for recomposing abstractions to adapt to novel situations. Using a toy example, a novel image classifier, and a language model, we demonstrate that GBI provides higher learning efficiency and generalization to novel tasks and limits forgetting. Moreover, we show that GBI has unique advantages such as preserving information for uncertainty estimation and detecting out-of-distribution samples.</description>

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for constructing prediction sets with guaranteed coverage. However, recent studies have shown that integrating confidence calibration with CP can lead to a degradation in efficiency. In this paper, We propose an adaptive approach that considers the classifier's uncertainty and employs entropy-based reweighting to enhance the efficiency of prediction sets for conformal classification.

      <title>Five reasons against assuming a data-generating distribution in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning research, as most of Statistics, heavily relies on the concept of a data-generating probability distribution. As data points are thought to be sampled from such a distribution, we can learn from observed data about this distribution and, thus, predict future data points drawn from it (with some probability of success). Drawing on scholarship across disciplines, we here argue that this framework is not always a good model. Not only do such true probability distributions not exist; the framework can also be misleading and obscure both the choices made and the goals pursued in machine learning practice. We suggest an alternative framework that focuses on finite populations rather than abstract distributions; while classical learning theory can be left almost unchanged, it opens new opportunities, especially to model sampling. We compile these considerations into five reasons for modelling machine learning -- in some settings -- with finite distributions rather than generative distributions, both to be more faithful to practice and to provide novel theoretical insights.</description>

      <title>Can Watermarking Large Language Models Prevent Copyrighted Text Generation and Hide Training Data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating diverse and contextually rich text. However, concerns regarding copyright infringement arise as LLMs may inadvertently produce copyrighted material. In this paper, we first investigate the effectiveness of watermarking LLMs as a deterrent against the generation of copyrighted texts. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that incorporating watermarks into LLMs significantly reduces the likelihood of generating copyrighted content, thereby addressing a critical concern in the deployment of LLMs. Additionally, we explore the impact of watermarking on Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which aim to discern whether a sample was part of the pretraining dataset and may be used to detect copyright violations. Surprisingly, we find that watermarking adversely affects the success rate of MIAs, complicating the task of detecting copyrighted text in the pretraining dataset. Finally, we propose an adaptive technique to improve the success rate of a recent MIA under watermarking. Our findings underscore the importance of developing adaptive methods to study critical problems in LLMs with potential legal implications.</description>

      <title>Nerva: a Truly Sparse Implementation of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Nerva, a fast neural network library under development in C++. It supports sparsity by using the sparse matrix operations of Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL), which eliminates the need for binary masks. We show that Nerva significantly decreases training time and memory usage while reaching equivalent accuracy to PyTorch. We run static sparse experiments with an MLP on CIFAR-10. On high sparsity levels like $99\%$, the runtime is reduced by a factor of $4\times$ compared to a PyTorch model using masks. Similar to other popular frameworks such as PyTorch and Keras, Nerva offers a Python interface for users to work with.</description>

      <title>Looking at Model Debiasing through the Lens of Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely recognized that deep neural networks are sensitive to bias in the data. This means that during training these models are likely to learn spurious correlations between data and labels, resulting in limited generalization abilities and low performance. In this context, model debiasing approaches can be devised aiming at reducing the model's dependency on such unwanted correlations, either leveraging the knowledge of bias information or not. In this work, we focus on the latter and more realistic scenario, showing the importance of accurately predicting the bias-conflicting and bias-aligned samples to obtain compelling performance in bias mitigation. On this ground, we propose to conceive the problem of model bias from an out-of-distribution perspective, introducing a new bias identification method based on anomaly detection. We claim that when data is mostly biased, bias-conflicting samples can be regarded as outliers with respect to the bias-aligned distribution in the feature space of a biased model, thus allowing for precisely detecting them with an anomaly detection method. Coupling the proposed bias identification approach with bias-conflicting data upsampling and augmentation in a two-step strategy, we reach state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real benchmark datasets. Ultimately, our proposed approach shows that the data bias issue does not necessarily require complex debiasing methods, given that an accurate bias identification procedure is defined.</description>

      <title>Hidden or Inferred: Fair Learning-To-Rank with Unknown Demographics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As learning-to-rank models are increasingly deployed for decision-making in areas with profound life implications, the FairML community has been developing fair learning-to-rank (LTR) models. These models rely on the availability of sensitive demographic features such as race or sex. However, in practice, regulatory obstacles and privacy concerns protect this data from collection and use. As a result, practitioners may either need to promote fairness despite the absence of these features or turn to demographic inference tools to attempt to infer them. Given that these tools are fallible, this paper aims to further understand how errors in demographic inference impact the fairness performance of popular fair LTR strategies. In which cases would it be better to keep such demographic attributes hidden from models versus infer them? We examine a spectrum of fair LTR strategies ranging from fair LTR with and without demographic features hidden versus inferred to fairness-unaware LTR followed by fair re-ranking. We conduct a controlled empirical investigation modeling different levels of inference errors by systematically perturbing the inferred sensitive attribute. We also perform three case studies with real-world datasets and popular open-source inference methods. Our findings reveal that as inference noise grows, LTR-based methods that incorporate fairness considerations into the learning process may increase bias. In contrast, fair re-ranking strategies are more robust to inference errors.

      <title>u-$\mu$P: The Unit-Scaled Maximal Update Parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) aims to make the optimal hyperparameters (HPs) of a model independent of its size, allowing them to be swept using a cheap proxy model rather than the full-size target model. We present a new scheme, u-$\mu$P, which improves upon $\mu$P by combining it with Unit Scaling, a method for designing models that makes them easy to train in low-precision. The two techniques have a natural affinity: $\mu$P ensures that the scale of activations is independent of model size, and Unit Scaling ensures that activations, weights and gradients begin training with a scale of one. This synthesis opens the door to a simpler scheme, whose default values are near-optimal. This in turn facilitates a more efficient sweeping strategy, with u-$\mu$P models reaching a lower loss than comparable $\mu$P models and working out-of-the-box in FP8.</description>

      <title>Traversing Pareto Optimal Policies: Provably Efficient Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL), which focuses on learning Pareto optimal policies in the presence of multiple reward functions. Despite MORL's significant empirical success, there is still a lack of satisfactory understanding of various MORL optimization targets and efficient learning algorithms. Our work offers a systematic analysis of several optimization targets to assess their abilities to find all Pareto optimal policies and controllability over learned policies by the preferences for different objectives. We then identify Tchebycheff scalarization as a favorable scalarization method for MORL. Considering the non-smoothness of Tchebycheff scalarization, we reformulate its minimization problem into a new min-max-max optimization problem. Then, for the stochastic policy class, we propose efficient algorithms using this reformulation to learn Pareto optimal policies. We first propose an online UCB-based algorithm to achieve an $\varepsilon$ learning error with an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity for a single given preference. To further reduce the cost of environment exploration under different preferences, we propose a preference-free framework that first explores the environment without pre-defined preferences and then generates solutions for any number of preferences. We prove that it only requires an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ exploration complexity in the exploration phase and demands no additional exploration afterward. Lastly, we analyze the smooth Tchebycheff scalarization, an extension of Tchebycheff scalarization, which is proved to be more advantageous in distinguishing the Pareto optimal policies from other weakly Pareto optimal policies based on entry values of preference vectors. Furthermore, we extend our algorithms and theoretical analysis to accommodate this optimization target.</description>

Abstract: Complex system simulation has been playing an irreplaceable role in understanding, predicting, and controlling diverse complex systems. In the past few decades, the multi-scale simulation technique has drawn increasing attention for its remarkable ability to overcome the challenges of complex system simulation with unknown mechanisms and expensive computational costs. In this survey, we will systematically review the literature on multi-scale simulation of complex systems from the perspective of knowledge and data. Firstly, we will present background knowledge about simulating complex system simulation and the scales in complex systems. Then, we divide the main objectives of multi-scale modeling and simulation into five categories by considering scenarios with clear scale and scenarios with unclear scale, respectively. After summarizing the general methods for multi-scale simulation based on the clues of knowledge and data, we introduce the adopted methods to achieve different objectives. Finally, we introduce the applications of multi-scale simulation in typical matter systems and social systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the update of weight matrices in learning algorithms can be described in the framework of Dyson Brownian motion, thereby inheriting many features of random matrix theory. We relate the level of stochasticity to the ratio of the learning rate and the mini-batch size, providing more robust evidence to a previously conjectured scaling relationship. We discuss universal and non-universal features in the resulting Coulomb gas distribution and identify the Wigner surmise and Wigner semicircle explicitly in a teacher-student model and in the (near-)solvable case of the Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machine.</description>

      <title>Applying generative neural networks for fast simulations of the ALICE (CERN) experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis investigates the application of state-of-the-art advances in generative neural networks for fast simulation of the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) neutron detector in the ALICE experiment at CERN. Traditional simulation methods using the GEANT Monte Carlo toolkit, while accurate, are computationally demanding. With increasing computational needs at CERN, efficient simulation techniques are essential. The thesis provides a comprehensive literature review on the application of neural networks in computer vision, fast simulations using machine learning, and generative neural networks in high-energy physics. The theory of the analyzed models is also discussed, along with technical aspects and the challenges associated with a practical implementation. The experiments evaluate various neural network architectures, including convolutional neural networks, vision transformers, and MLP-Mixers, as well as generative frameworks such as autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, vector quantization models, and diffusion models. Key contributions include the implementation and evaluation of these models, a significant improvement in the Wasserstein metric compared to existing methods with a low generation time of 5 milliseconds per sample, and the formulation of a list of recommendations for developing models for fast ZDC simulation. Open-source code and detailed hyperparameter settings are provided for reproducibility. Additionally, the thesis outlines future research directions to further enhance simulation fidelity and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a key driver of precision agriculture, facilitating enhanced crop productivity, optimized resource use, farm sustainability, and informed decision-making. Also, the expansion of genome sequencing technology has greatly increased crop genomic resources, deepening our understanding of genetic variation and enhancing desirable crop traits to optimize performance in various environments. There is increasing interest in using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms for genotype-to-phenotype prediction due to their excellence in capturing complex interactions within large, high-dimensional datasets. In this work, we propose a new LSTM autoencoder-based model for barley genotype-to-phenotype prediction, specifically for flowering time and grain yield estimation, which could potentially help optimize yields and management practices. Our model outperformed the other baseline methods, demonstrating its potential in handling complex high-dimensional agricultural datasets and enhancing crop phenotype prediction performance.</description>

      <title>Research on Adverse Drug Reaction Prediction Model Combining Knowledge Graph Embedding and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In clinical treatment, identifying potential adverse reactions of drugs can help assist doctors in making medication decisions. In response to the problems in previous studies that features are high-dimensional and sparse, independent prediction models need to be constructed for each adverse reaction of drugs, and the prediction accuracy is low, this paper develops an adverse drug reaction prediction model based on knowledge graph embedding and deep learning, which can predict experimental results. Unified prediction of adverse drug reactions covered. Knowledge graph embedding technology can fuse the associated information between drugs and alleviate the shortcomings of high-dimensional sparsity in feature matrices, and the efficient training capabilities of deep learning can improve the prediction accuracy of the model. This article builds an adverse drug reaction knowledge graph based on drug feature data; by analyzing the embedding effect of the knowledge graph under different embedding strategies, the best embedding strategy is selected to obtain sample vectors; and then a convolutional neural network model is constructed to predict adverse reactions. The results show that under the DistMult embedding model and 400-dimensional embedding strategy, the convolutional neural network model has the best prediction effect; the average accuracy, F_1 score, recall rate and area under the curve of repeated experiments are better than the methods reported in the literature. The obtained prediction model has good prediction accuracy and stability, and can provide an effective reference for later safe medication guidance.</description>

      <title>Exploring The Neural Burden In Pruned Models: An Insight Inspired By Neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformer and its variants have been adopted in many visual tasks due to their powerful capabilities, which also bring significant challenges in computation and storage. Consequently, researchers have introduced various compression methods in recent years, among which the pruning techniques are widely used to remove a significant fraction of the network. Therefore, these methods can reduce significant percent of the FLOPs, but often lead to a decrease in model performance. To investigate the underlying causes, we focus on the pruning methods specifically belonging to the pruning-during-training category, then drew inspiration from neuroscience and propose a new concept for artificial neural network models named Neural Burden. We investigate its impact in the model pruning process, and subsequently explore a simple yet effective approach to mitigate the decline in model performance, which can be applied to any pruning-during-training technique. Extensive experiments indicate that the neural burden phenomenon indeed exists, and show the potential of our method. We hope that our findings can provide valuable insights for future research. Code will be made publicly available after this paper is published.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Models for the Identification of Cardiovascular Diseases Using UK Biobank Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models have the potential to identify cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) early and accurately in primary healthcare settings, which is crucial for delivering timely treatment and management. Although population-based CVD risk models have been used traditionally, these models often do not consider variations in lifestyles, socioeconomic conditions, or genetic predispositions. Therefore, we aimed to develop machine learning models for CVD detection using primary healthcare data, compare the performance of different models, and identify the best models. We used data from the UK Biobank study, which included over 500,000 middle-aged participants from different primary healthcare centers in the UK. Data collected at baseline (2006--2010) and during imaging visits after 2014 were used in this study. Baseline characteristics, including sex, age, and the Townsend Deprivation Index, were included. Participants were classified as having CVD if they reported at least one of the following conditions: heart attack, angina, stroke, or high blood pressure. Cardiac imaging data such as electrocardiogram and echocardiography data, including left ventricular size and function, cardiac output, and stroke volume, were also used. We used 9 machine learning models (LSVM, RBFSVM, GP, DT, RF, NN, AdaBoost, NB, and QDA), which are explainable and easily interpretable. We reported the accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 scores; confusion matrices; and area under the curve (AUC) curves.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Privacy Leakage in Trustworthy Federated Learning: A Perspective from Linear Algebra and Optimization Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, recent studies have shown that it is vulnerable to various privacy attacks, such as data reconstruction attacks. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of privacy leakage in federated learning from two perspectives: linear algebra and optimization theory. From the linear algebra perspective, we prove that when the Jacobian matrix of the batch data is not full rank, there exist different batches of data that produce the same model update, thereby ensuring a level of privacy. We derive a sufficient condition on the batch size to prevent data reconstruction attacks. From the optimization theory perspective, we establish an upper bound on the privacy leakage in terms of the batch size, the distortion extent, and several other factors. Our analysis provides insights into the relationship between privacy leakage and various aspects of federated learning, offering a theoretical foundation for designing privacy-preserving federated learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Automotive Supply Chain Disruption with Heterogeneous Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operational disruptions can significantly impact companies performance. Ford, with its 37 plants globally, uses 17 billion parts annually to manufacture six million cars and trucks. With up to ten tiers of suppliers between the company and raw materials, any extended disruption in this supply chain can cause substantial financial losses. Therefore, the ability to forecast and identify such disruptions early is crucial for maintaining seamless operations. In this study, we demonstrate how we construct a dataset consisting of many multivariate time series to forecast first-tier supply chain disruptions, utilizing features related to capacity, inventory, utilization, and processing, as outlined in the classical Factory Physics framework. This dataset is technically challenging due to its vast scale of over five hundred thousand time series. Furthermore, these time series, while exhibiting certain similarities, also display heterogeneity within specific subgroups. To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology that integrates an enhanced Attention Sequence to Sequence Deep Learning architecture, using Neural Network Embeddings to model group effects, with a Survival Analysis model. This model is designed to learn intricate heterogeneous data patterns related to operational disruptions. Our model has demonstrated a strong performance, achieving 0.85 precision and 0.8 recall during the Quality Assurance (QA) phase across Ford's five North American plants. Additionally, to address the common criticism of Machine Learning models as black boxes, we show how the SHAP framework can be used to generate feature importance from the model predictions. It offers valuable insights that can lead to actionable strategies and highlights the potential of advanced machine learning for managing and mitigating supply chain risks in the automotive industry.</description>

      <title>PLM-Net: Perception Latency Mitigation Network for Vision-Based Lateral Control of Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces the Perception Latency Mitigation Network (PLM-Net), a novel deep learning approach for addressing perception latency in vision-based Autonomous Vehicle (AV) lateral control systems. Perception latency is the delay between capturing the environment through vision sensors (e.g., cameras) and applying an action (e.g., steering). This issue is understudied in both classical and neural-network-based control methods. Reducing this latency with powerful GPUs and FPGAs is possible but impractical for automotive platforms. PLM-Net comprises the Base Model (BM) and the Timed Action Prediction Model (TAPM). BM represents the original Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) system, while TAPM predicts future actions for different latency values. By integrating these models, PLM-Net mitigates perception latency. The final output is determined through linear interpolation of BM and TAPM outputs based on real-time latency. This design addresses both constant and varying latency, improving driving trajectories and steering control. Experimental results validate the efficacy of PLM-Net across various latency conditions.

      <title>VisMin: Visual Minimal-Change Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-grained understanding of objects, attributes, and relationships between objects is crucial for visual-language models (VLMs). Existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating VLMs' capability to distinguish between two very similar \textit{captions} given an image. In this paper, we introduce a new, challenging benchmark termed \textbf{Vis}ual \textbf{Min}imal-Change Understanding (VisMin), which requires models to predict the correct image-caption match given two images and two captions. The image pair and caption pair contain minimal changes, i.e., only one aspect changes at a time from among the following: \textit{object}, \textit{attribute}, \textit{count}, and \textit{spatial relation}. These changes test the models' understanding of objects, attributes (such as color, material, shape), counts, and spatial relationships between objects. We built an automatic framework using large language models and diffusion models, followed by a rigorous 4-step verification process by human annotators. Empirical experiments reveal that current VLMs exhibit notable deficiencies in understanding spatial relationships and counting abilities. We also generate a large-scale training dataset to finetune CLIP and Idefics2, showing significant improvements in fine-grained understanding across benchmarks and in CLIP's general image-text alignment. We release all resources, including the benchmark, training data, and finetuned model checkpoints, at \url{https://vismin.net/}.</description>

      <title>What Matters in Range View 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lidar-based perception pipelines rely on 3D object detection models to interpret complex scenes. While multiple representations for lidar exist, the range-view is enticing since it losslessly encodes the entire lidar sensor output. In this work, we achieve state-of-the-art amongst range-view 3D object detection models without using multiple techniques proposed in past range-view literature. We explore range-view 3D object detection across two modern datasets with substantially different properties: Argoverse 2 and Waymo Open. Our investigation reveals key insights: (1) input feature dimensionality significantly influences the overall performance, (2) surprisingly, employing a classification loss grounded in 3D spatial proximity works as well or better compared to more elaborate IoU-based losses, and (3) addressing non-uniform lidar density via a straightforward range subsampling technique outperforms existing multi-resolution, range-conditioned networks. Our experiments reveal that techniques proposed in recent range-view literature are not needed to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Combining the above findings, we establish a new state-of-the-art model for range-view 3D object detection -- improving AP by 2.2% on the Waymo Open dataset while maintaining a runtime of 10 Hz. We establish the first range-view model on the Argoverse 2 dataset and outperform strong voxel-based baselines. All models are multi-class and open-source.

      <title>Distribution-Aware Robust Learning from Long-Tailed Data with Noisy Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable advancements in various fields using large, well-annotated datasets. However, real-world data often exhibit long-tailed distributions and label noise, significantly degrading generalization performance. Recent studies addressing these issues have focused on noisy sample selection methods that estimate the centroid of each class based on high-confidence samples within each target class. The performance of these methods is limited because they use only the training samples within each class for class centroid estimation, making the quality of centroids susceptible to long-tailed distributions and noisy labels. In this study, we present a robust training framework called Distribution-aware Sample Selection and Contrastive Learning (DaSC). Specifically, DaSC introduces a Distribution-aware Class Centroid Estimation (DaCC) to generate enhanced class centroids. DaCC performs weighted averaging of the features from all samples, with weights determined based on model predictions. Additionally, we propose a confidence-aware contrastive learning strategy to obtain balanced and robust representations. The training samples are categorized into high-confidence and low-confidence samples. Our method then applies Semi-supervised Balanced Contrastive Loss (SBCL) using high-confidence samples, leveraging reliable label information to mitigate class bias. For the low-confidence samples, our method computes Mixup-enhanced Instance Discrimination Loss (MIDL) to improve their representations in a self-supervised manner. Our experimental results on CIFAR and real-world noisy-label datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DaSC compared to previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Fusion and Cross-Modal Transfer for Zero-Shot Human Action Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite living in a multi-sensory world, most AI models are limited to textual and visual interpretations of human motion and behavior. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) provide a salient signal to understand human motion; however, they are challenging to use due to their uninterpretability and scarcity of their data. We investigate a method to transfer knowledge between visual and inertial modalities using the structure of an informative joint representation space designed for human action recognition (HAR). We apply the resulting Fusion and Cross-modal Transfer (FACT) method to a novel setup, where the model does not have access to labeled IMU data during training and is able to perform HAR with only IMU data during testing. Extensive experiments on a wide range of RGB-IMU datasets demonstrate that FACT significantly outperforms existing methods in zero-shot cross-modal transfer.</description>

      <title>Pareto Front Approximation for Multi-Objective Session-Based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces MultiTRON, an approach that adapts Pareto front approximation techniques to multi-objective session-based recommender systems using a transformer neural network. Our approach optimizes trade-offs between key metrics such as click-through and conversion rates by training on sampled preference vectors. A significant advantage is that after training, a single model can access the entire Pareto front, allowing it to be tailored to meet the specific requirements of different stakeholders by adjusting an additional input vector that weights the objectives. We validate the model's performance through extensive offline and online evaluation. For broader application and research, the source code is made available at https://github.com/otto-de/MultiTRON . The results confirm the model's ability to manage multiple recommendation objectives effectively, offering a flexible tool for diverse business needs.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented Generation or Long-Context LLMs? A Comprehensive Study and Hybrid Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has been a powerful tool for Large Language Models (LLMs) to efficiently process overly lengthy contexts. However, recent LLMs like Gemini-1.5 and GPT-4 show exceptional capabilities to understand long contexts directly. We conduct a comprehensive comparison between RAG and long-context (LC) LLMs, aiming to leverage the strengths of both. We benchmark RAG and LC across various public datasets using three latest LLMs. Results reveal that when resourced sufficiently, LC consistently outperforms RAG in terms of average performance. However, RAG's significantly lower cost remains a distinct advantage. Based on this observation, we propose Self-Route, a simple yet effective method that routes queries to RAG or LC based on model self-reflection. Self-Route significantly reduces the computation cost while maintaining a comparable performance to LC. Our findings provide a guideline for long-context applications of LLMs using RAG and LC.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Level Hierarchical Framework for the Classification of Weather Conditions and Hazard Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a multilevel hierarchical framework for the classification of weather conditions and hazard prediction. In recent years, the importance of data has grown significantly, with various types like text, numbers, images, audio, and videos playing a key role. Among these, images make up a large portion of the data available. This application shows promise for various purposes, especially when combined with decision support systems for traffic management, afforestation, and weather forecasting. It's particularly useful in situations where traditional weather predictions are not very accurate, such as ensuring the safe operation of self driving cars in dangerous weather. While previous studies have looked at this topic with fewer categories, this paper focuses on eleven specific types of weather images. The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict weather conditions after being trained on a large dataset of images. Accuracy is crucial in real-life situations to prevent accidents, making it the top priority for this paper. This work lays the groundwork for future applications in weather prediction, especially in situations where human expertise is not available or may be biased. The framework, capable of classifying images into eleven weather categories: dew, frost, glaze, rime, snow, hail, rain, lightning, rainbow, and sandstorm, provides real-time weather information with an accuracy of 0.9329. The proposed framework addresses the growing need for accurate weather classification and hazard prediction, offering a robust solution for various applications in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-head-self-attention (MHSA) mechanisms achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across natural language processing and vision tasks. However, their quadratic dependence on sequence lengths has bottlenecked inference speeds. To circumvent this bottleneck, researchers have proposed various sparse-MHSA models, where a subset of full attention is computed. Despite their promise, current sparse libraries and compilers do not support high-performance implementations for diverse sparse-MHSA patterns due to the underlying sparse formats they operate on. These formats, which are typically designed for high-performance &amp; scientific computing applications, are either curated for extreme amounts of random sparsity (&lt;1% non-zero values), or specific sparsity patterns. However, the sparsity patterns in sparse-MHSA are moderately sparse (10-50% non-zero values) and varied, resulting in existing sparse-formats trading off generality for performance.
  We bridge this gap, achieving both generality and performance, by proposing a novel sparse format: affine-compressed-sparse-row (ACSR) and supporting code-generation scheme, SPLAT, that generates high-performance implementations for diverse sparse-MHSA patterns on GPUs. Core to our proposed format and code generation algorithm is the observation that common sparse-MHSA patterns have uniquely regular geometric properties. These properties, which can be analyzed just-in-time, expose novel optimizations and tiling strategies that SPLAT exploits to generate high-performance implementations for diverse patterns. To demonstrate SPLAT's efficacy, we use it to generate code for various sparse-MHSA models, achieving geomean speedups of 2.05x and 4.05x over hand-written kernels written in triton and TVM respectively on A100 GPUs. Moreover, its interfaces are intuitive and easy to use with existing implementations of MHSA in JAX.</description>

      <title>SECRM-2D: RL-Based Efficient and Comfortable Route-Following Autonomous Driving with Analytic Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, there has been increasing interest in autonomous driving systems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) shows great promise for training autonomous driving controllers, being able to directly optimize a combination of criteria such as efficiency comfort, and stability. However, RL- based controllers typically offer no safety guarantees, making their readiness for real deployment questionable. In this paper, we propose SECRM-2D (the Safe, Efficient and Comfortable RL- based driving Model with Lane-Changing), an RL autonomous driving controller (both longitudinal and lateral) that balances optimization of efficiency and comfort and follows a fixed route, while being subject to hard analytic safety constraints. The aforementioned safety constraints are derived from the criterion that the follower vehicle must have sufficient headway to be able to avoid a crash if the leader vehicle brakes suddenly. We evaluate SECRM-2D against several learning and non-learning baselines in simulated test scenarios, including freeway driving, exiting, merging, and emergency braking. Our results confirm that representative previously-published RL AV controllers may crash in both training and testing, even if they are optimizing a safety objective. By contrast, our controller SECRM-2D is successful in avoiding crashes during both training and testing, improves over the baselines in measures of efficiency and comfort, and is more faithful in following the prescribed route. In addition, we achieve a good theoretical understanding of the longitudinal steady-state of a collection of SECRM-2D vehicles.</description>

      <title>From Text to Insight: Large Language Models for Materials Science Data Extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vast majority of materials science knowledge exists in unstructured natural language, yet structured data is crucial for innovative and systematic materials design. Traditionally, the field has relied on manual curation and partial automation for data extraction for specific use cases. The advent of large language models (LLMs) represents a significant shift, potentially enabling efficient extraction of structured, actionable data from unstructured text by non-experts. While applying LLMs to materials science data extraction presents unique challenges, domain knowledge offers opportunities to guide and validate LLM outputs. This review provides a comprehensive overview of LLM-based structured data extraction in materials science, synthesizing current knowledge and outlining future directions. We address the lack of standardized guidelines and present frameworks for leveraging the synergy between LLMs and materials science expertise. This work serves as a foundational resource for researchers aiming to harness LLMs for data-driven materials research. The insights presented here could significantly enhance how researchers across disciplines access and utilize scientific information, potentially accelerating the development of novel materials for critical societal needs.</description>

      <title>Trust Your Gut: Comparing Human and Machine Inference from Noisy Visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People commonly utilize visualizations not only to examine a given dataset, but also to draw generalizable conclusions about the underlying models or phenomena. Prior research has compared human visual inference to that of an optimal Bayesian agent, with deviations from rational analysis viewed as problematic. However, human reliance on non-normative heuristics may prove advantageous in certain circumstances. We investigate scenarios where human intuition might surpass idealized statistical rationality. In two experiments, we examine individuals' accuracy in characterizing the parameters of known data-generating models from bivariate visualizations. Our findings indicate that, although participants generally exhibited lower accuracy compared to statistical models, they frequently outperformed Bayesian agents, particularly when faced with extreme samples. Participants appeared to rely on their internal models to filter out noisy visualizations, thus improving their resilience against spurious data. However, participants displayed overconfidence and struggled with uncertainty estimation. They also exhibited higher variance than statistical machines. Our findings suggest that analyst gut reactions to visualizations may provide an advantage, even when departing from rationality. These results carry implications for designing visual analytics tools, offering new perspectives on how to integrate statistical models and analyst intuition for improved inference and decision-making.

      <title>Neural Network-Based Bandit: A Medium Access Control for the IIoT Alarm Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient Random Access (RA) is critical for enabling reliable communication in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks. Herein, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based distributed RA scheme, entitled Neural Network-Based Bandit (NNBB), for the IIoT alarm scenario. In such a scenario, the devices may detect a common critical event, and the goal is to ensure the alarm information is delivered successfully from at least one device. The proposed NNBB scheme is implemented at each device, where it trains itself online and establishes implicit inter-device coordination to achieve the common goal. Devices can transmit simultaneously on multiple orthogonal channels and each possible transmission pattern constitutes a possible action for the NNBB, which uses a deep neural network to determine the action. Our simulation results show that as the number of devices in the network increases, so does the performance gain of the NNBB compared to the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) RA benchmark. For instance, NNBB experiences a 7% success rate drop when there are four channels and the number of devices increases from 10 to 60, while MAB faces a 25% drop.</description>

Abstract: Data is critical to advancing AI technologies, yet its quality and documentation remain significant challenges, leading to adverse downstream effects (e.g., potential biases) in AI applications. This paper addresses these issues by introducing Croissant-RAI, a machine-readable metadata format designed to enhance the discoverability, interoperability, and trustworthiness of AI datasets. Croissant-RAI extends the Croissant metadata format and builds upon existing responsible AI (RAI) documentation frameworks, offering a standardized set of attributes and practices to facilitate community-wide adoption. Leveraging established web-publishing practices, such as Schema.org, Croissant-RAI enables dataset users to easily find and utilize RAI metadata regardless of the platform on which the datasets are published. Furthermore, it is seamlessly integrated into major data search engines, repositories, and machine learning frameworks, streamlining the reading and writing of responsible AI metadata within practitioners' existing workflows. Croissant-RAI was developed through a community-led effort. It has been designed to be adaptable to evolving documentation requirements and is supported by a Python library and a visual editor.</description>

Abstract: Educational Data Mining (EDM) is a promising field, where data mining is widely used for predicting students performance. One of the most prevalent and recent challenge that higher education faces today is making students skillfully employable. Institutions possess large volume of data; still they are unable to reveal knowledge and guide their students. Data in education is generally very large, multidimensional and unbalanced in nature. Process of extracting knowledge from such data has its own set of problems and is a very complicated task. In this paper, Engineering and MCA (Masters in Computer Applications) students data is collected from various universities and institutes pan India. The dataset is large, unbalanced and multidimensional in nature. A cluster based model is presented in this paper, which, when applied at preprocessing stage helps in parsimonious selection of variables and improves the performance of predictive algorithms. Hence, facilitate in better prediction of Students Employability.</description>

      <title>A Nested Model for AI Design and Validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning field of artificial intelligence (AI) has yet to fully permeate real-world applications, largely due to issues of trust, transparency, and concerns about fairness and discrimination. Despite the increasing need for new and revised regulations to address the ethical and legal risks of using AI, there is a mismatch between regulatory science and AI, hindering the creation of a consistent framework. This highlights the need for guidance and regulation, especially as new AI legislation emerges. To bridge this gap, we propose a five-layer nested model for AI design and validation. This model is designed to address the challenges faced by AI practitioners and streamline the design and validation of AI applications and workflows, thereby improving fairness, trust, and AI adoption. This model not only parallels regulations and addresses the daily challenges faced by AI practitioners, but also provides prescriptive guidance for determining appropriate evaluation approaches by identifying threats to validity unique to each layer. We also provide three recommendations motivated by this model: authors should distinguish between layers when claiming contributions to clarify the specific areas in which the contribution is made and to avoid confusion, authors should explicitly state upstream assumptions to ensure that the context and limitations of their AI system are clearly understood, AI venues should promote thorough testing and validation of AI systems and their compliance with regulatory requirements</description>

      <title>Exploring Fusion Techniques in Multimodal AI-Based Recruitment: Insights from FairCVdb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the large body of work on fairness-aware learning for individual modalities like tabular data, images, and text, less work has been done on multimodal data, which fuses various modalities for a comprehensive analysis. In this work, we investigate the fairness and bias implications of multimodal fusion techniques in the context of multimodal AI-based recruitment systems using the FairCVdb dataset. Our results show that early-fusion closely matches the ground truth for both demographics, achieving the lowest MAEs by integrating each modality's unique characteristics. In contrast, late-fusion leads to highly generalized mean scores and higher MAEs. Our findings emphasise the significant potential of early-fusion for accurate and fair applications, even in the presence of demographic biases, compared to late-fusion. Future research could explore alternative fusion strategies and incorporate modality-related fairness constraints to improve fairness.

      <title>Free to play: UN Trade and Development's experience with developing its own open-source Retrieval Augmented Generation Large Language Model application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular Large Language Models (LLMs), have exploded in popularity and attention since the release to the public of ChatGPT's Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-3.5 model in November of 2022. Due to the power of these general purpose models and their ability to communicate in natural language, they can be useful in a range of domains, including the work of official statistics and international organizations. However, with such a novel and seemingly complex technology, it can feel as if generative AI is something that happens to an organization, something that can be talked about but not understood, that can be commented on but not contributed to. Additionally, the costs of adoption and operation of proprietary solutions can be both uncertain and high, a barrier for often cost-constrained international organizations. In the face of these challenges, United Nations Trade and Development (UNCTAD), through its Global Crisis Response Group (GCRG), has explored and developed its own open-source Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM application. RAG makes LLMs aware of and more useful for the organization's domain and work. Developing in-house solutions comes with pros and cons, with pros including cost, flexibility, and fostering institutional knowledge. Cons include time and skill investments and gaps and application polish and power. The three libraries developed to produce the app, nlp_pipeline for document processing and statistical analysis, local_rag_llm for running a local RAG LLM, and streamlit_rag for the user interface, are publicly available on PyPI and GitHub with Dockerfiles. A fourth library, local_llm_finetune, is also available for fine-tuning existing LLMs which can then be used in the application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of the Internet in the field of education is becoming more and more popular, and a large amount of educational data is generated in the process. How to effectively use these data has always been a key issue in the field of educational data mining. In this work, a machine learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) was used to conduct an in-depth analysis of educational big data to evaluate student performance. The LSTM model efficiently processes time series data, allowing us to capture time-dependent and long-term trends in students' learning activities. This approach is particularly useful for analyzing student progress, engagement, and other behavioral patterns to support personalized education. In an experimental analysis, we verified the effectiveness of the deep learning method in predicting student performance by comparing the performance of different models. Strict cross-validation techniques are used to ensure the accuracy and generalization of experimental results.</description>

      <title>Generation Constraint Scaling Can Mitigate Hallucination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing the issue of hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) is a critical challenge. As the cognitive mechanisms of hallucination have been related to memory, here we explore hallucination for LLM that is enabled with explicit memory mechanisms. We empirically demonstrate that by simply scaling the readout vector that constrains generation in a memory-augmented LLM decoder, hallucination mitigation can be achieved in a training-free manner. Our method is geometry-inspired and outperforms a state-of-the-art LLM editing method on the task of generation of Wikipedia-like biography entries both in terms of generation quality and runtime complexity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are on the verge of a revolutionary era in space exploration, thanks to advancements in telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope (\textit{JWST}). High-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra from exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres have been collected over the past few decades, requiring the development of accurate and reliable pipelines and tools for their analysis. Accurately and swiftly determining the spectroscopic parameters from the observational spectra of these objects is crucial for understanding their atmospheric composition and guiding future follow-up observations. \texttt{TelescopeML} is a Python package developed to perform three main tasks: 1. Process the synthetic astronomical datasets for training a CNN model and prepare the observational dataset for later use for prediction; 2. Train a CNN model by implementing the optimal hyperparameters; and 3. Deploy the trained CNN models on the actual observational data to derive the output spectroscopic parameters.</description>

      <title>Handling Device Heterogeneity for Deep Learning-based Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based fingerprinting is one of the current promising technologies for outdoor localization in cellular networks. However, deploying such localization systems for heterogeneous phones affects their accuracy as the cellular received signal strength (RSS) readings vary for different types of phones. In this paper, we introduce a number of techniques for addressing the phones heterogeneity problem in the deep-learning based localization systems. The basic idea is either to approximate a function that maps the cellular RSS measurements between different devices or to transfer the knowledge across them.
  Evaluation of the proposed techniques using different Android phones on four independent testbeds shows that our techniques can improve the localization accuracy by more than 220% for the four testbeds as compared to the state-of-the-art systems. This highlights the promise of the proposed device heterogeneity handling techniques for enabling a wide deployment of deep learning-based localization systems over different devices.</description>

      <title>DeepCell: A Ubiquitous Accurate Provider-side Cellular-based Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although outdoor localization is already available to the general public and businesses through the wide spread use of the GPS, it is not supported by low-end phones, requires a direct line of sight to satellites and can drain phone battery quickly. The current fingerprinting solutions can provide high-accuracy localization but are based on the client side. This limits their ubiquitous deployment and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce DeepCell: a provider-side fingerprinting localization system that can provide high accuracy localization for any cell phone. To build its fingerprint, DeepCell leverages the unlabeled cellular measurements recorded by the cellular provider while opportunistically synchronizing with selected client devices to get location labels. The fingerprint is then used to train a deep neural network model that is harnessed for localization. To achieve this goal, DeepCell need to address a number of challenges including using unlabeled data from the provider side, handling noise and sparsity, scaling the data to large areas, and finally providing enough data that is required for training deep models without overhead. Evaluation of DeepCell in a typical realistic environment shows that it can achieve a consistent median accuracy of 29m. This accuracy outperforms the state-of-the-art client-based cellular-based systems by more than 75.4%. In addition, the same accuracy is extended to low-end phones.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a modeling-control synthesis to address the quality control challenges in multistage manufacturing systems (MMSs). A new feedforward control scheme is developed to minimize the quality variations caused by process disturbances in MMSs. Notably, the control framework leverages a stochastic deep Koopman (SDK) model to capture the quality propagation mechanism in the MMSs, highlighted by its ability to transform the nonlinear propagation dynamics into a linear one. Two roll-to-roll case studies are presented to validate the proposed method and demonstrate its effectiveness. The overall method is suitable for nonlinear MMSs and does not require extensive expert knowledge.</description>

      <title>Federated Automatic Latent Variable Selection in Multi-output Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a federated learning approach that automatically selects the number of latent processes in multi-output Gaussian processes (MGPs). The MGP has seen great success as a transfer learning tool when data is generated from multiple sources/units/entities. A common approach in MGPs to transfer knowledge across units involves gathering all data from each unit to a central server and extracting common independent latent processes to express each unit as a linear combination of the shared latent patterns. However, this approach poses key challenges in (i) determining the adequate number of latent processes and (ii) relying on centralized learning which leads to potential privacy risks and significant computational burdens on the central server. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical model that places spike-and-slab priors on the coefficients of each latent process. These priors help automatically select only needed latent processes by shrinking the coefficients of unnecessary ones to zero. To estimate the model while avoiding the drawbacks of centralized learning, we propose a variational inference-based approach, that formulates model inference as an optimization problem compatible with federated settings. We then design a federated learning algorithm that allows units to jointly select and infer the common latent processes without sharing their data. We also discuss an efficient learning approach for a new unit within our proposed federated framework. Simulation and case studies on Li-ion battery degradation and air temperature data demonstrate the advantageous features of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Provable Benefit of Annealed Langevin Monte Carlo for Non-log-concave Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the outstanding problem of sampling from an unnormalized density that may be non-log-concave and multimodal. To enhance the performance of simple Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, techniques of annealing type have been widely used. However, quantitative theoretical guarantees of these techniques are under-explored. This study takes a first step toward providing a non-asymptotic analysis of annealed MCMC. Specifically, we establish, for the first time, an oracle complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{d\beta^2{\cal A}^2}{\varepsilon^6}\right)$ for simple annealed Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm to achieve $\varepsilon^2$ accuracy in Kullback-Leibler divergence to the target distribution $\pi\propto{\rm e}^{-V}$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $\beta$-smooth potential $V$. Here, ${\cal A}$ represents the action of a curve of probability measures interpolating the target distribution $\pi$ and a readily sampleable distribution.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Trajectory Generation Through Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Location trajectories provide valuable insights for applications from urban planning to pandemic control. However, mobility data can also reveal sensitive information about individuals, such as political opinions, religious beliefs, or sexual orientations. Existing privacy-preserving approaches for publishing this data face a significant utility-privacy trade-off. Releasing synthetic trajectory data generated through deep learning offers a promising solution. Due to the trajectories' sequential nature, most existing models are based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, research in generative adversarial networks (GANs) largely employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image generation. This discrepancy raises the question of whether advances in computer vision can be applied to trajectory generation. In this work, we introduce a Reversible Trajectory-to-CNN Transformation (RTCT) that adapts trajectories into a format suitable for CNN-based models. We integrated this transformation with the well-known DCGAN in a proof-of-concept (PoC) and evaluated its performance against an RNN-based trajectory GAN using four metrics across two datasets. The PoC was superior in capturing spatial distributions compared to the RNN model but had difficulty replicating sequential and temporal properties. Although the PoC's utility is not sufficient for practical applications, the results demonstrate the transformation's potential to facilitate the use of CNNs for trajectory generation, opening up avenues for future research. To support continued research, all source code has been made available under an open-source license.</description>

      <title>Towards Transfer Unlearning: Empirical Evidence of Cross-Domain Bias Mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often inherit biases from vast amounts of training corpora. Traditional debiasing methods, while effective to some extent, do not completely eliminate memorized biases and toxicity in LLMs. In this paper, we study an unlearning-based approach to debiasing in LLMs by performing gradient ascent on hate speech against minority groups, i.e., minimizing the likelihood of biased or toxic content. Specifically, we propose a mask language modeling unlearning technique, which unlearns the harmful part of the text. This method enables LLMs to selectively forget and disassociate from biased and harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in diminishing bias while maintaining the language modeling abilities. Surprisingly, the results also unveil an unexpected potential for cross-domain transfer unlearning: debiasing in one bias form (e.g. gender) may contribute to mitigating others (e.g. race and religion).</description>

      <title>When AI Defeats Password Deception! A Deep Learning Framework to Distinguish Passwords and Honeywords</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: "Honeywords" have emerged as a promising defense mechanism for detecting data breaches and foiling offline dictionary attacks (ODA) by deceiving attackers with false passwords. In this paper, we propose PassFilter, a novel deep learning (DL) based attack framework, fundamental in its ability to identify passwords from a set of sweetwords associated with a user account, effectively challenging a variety of honeywords generation techniques (HGTs). The DL model in PassFilter is trained with a set of previously collected or adversarially generated passwords and honeywords, and carefully orchestrated to predict whether a sweetword is the password or a honeyword. Our model can compromise the security of state-of-the-art, heuristics-based, and representation learning-based HGTs proposed by Dionysiou et al. Specifically, our analysis with nine publicly available password datasets shows that PassFilter significantly outperforms the baseline random guessing success rate of 5%, achieving 6.10% to 52.78% on the 1st guessing attempt, considering 20 sweetwords per account. This success rate rapidly increases with additional login attempts before account lock-outs, often allowed on many real-world online services to maintain reasonable usability. For example, it ranges from 41.78% to 96.80% for five attempts, and from 72.87% to 99.00% for ten attempts, compared to 25% and 50% random guessing, respectively. We also examined PassFilter against general-purpose language models used for honeyword generation, like those proposed by Yu et al. These honeywords also proved vulnerable to our attack, with success rates of 14.19% for 1st guessing attempt, increasing to 30.23%, 41.70%, and 63.10% after 3rd, 5th, and 10th guessing attempts, respectively. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of DL model deployed in PassFilter in breaching state-of-the-art HGTs and compromising password security based on ODA.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Variance-Reduced Iterative Hard Thresholding in Graph Sparsity Optimization</title>

Abstract: Stochastic optimization algorithms are widely used for large-scale data analysis due to their low per-iteration costs, but they often suffer from slow asymptotic convergence caused by inherent variance. Variance-reduced techniques have been therefore used to address this issue in structured sparse models utilizing sparsity-inducing norms or $\ell_0$-norms. However, these techniques are not directly applicable to complex (non-convex) graph sparsity models, which are essential in applications like disease outbreak monitoring and social network analysis. In this paper, we introduce two stochastic variance-reduced gradient-based methods to solve graph sparsity optimization: GraphSVRG-IHT and GraphSCSG-IHT. We provide a general framework for theoretical analysis, demonstrating that our methods enjoy a linear convergence speed. Extensive experiments validate</description>

      <title>Towards Aligning Language Models with Textual Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ALT (ALignment with Textual feedback), an approach that aligns language models with user preferences expressed in text. We argue that text offers greater expressiveness, enabling users to provide richer feedback than simple comparative preferences and this richer feedback can lead to more efficient and effective alignment. ALT aligns the model by conditioning its generation on the textual feedback. Our method relies solely on language modeling techniques and requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning, though it still presents the main benefits of RL-based alignment algorithms and can effectively learn from textual feedback. We explore the efficacy and efficiency of textual feedback across different tasks such as toxicity reduction, summarization, and dialog response generation. We find that ALT outperforms PPO for the task of toxicity reduction while being able to match its performance on summarization with only 20% of the samples. We also explore how ALT can be used with feedback provided by an existing LLM where we explore an LLM providing constrained and unconstrained textual feedback. We also outline future directions to align models with natural language feedback.</description>

      <title>A Voter-Based Stochastic Rejection-Method Framework for Asymptotically Safe Language Model Outputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for preventing unsafe or otherwise low quality large language model (LLM) outputs, by leveraging the stochasticity of LLMs. We propose a system whereby LLM checkers vote on the acceptability of a generated output, regenerating it if a threshold of disapproval is reached, until sufficient checkers approve. We further propose estimators for cost and failure rate, and based on those estimators and experimental data tailored to the application, we propose an algorithm that achieves a desired failure rate at the least possible cost. We demonstrate that, under these models, failure rate decreases exponentially as a function of cost when voter count and threshold are chosen according to the algorithm, and that the models reasonably estimate the actual performance of such a system in action, even with limited data.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Procedure for Computing Bayesian Network Structure Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a globally optimal Bayesian network structure discovery algorithm based on a progressively leveled scoring approach. Bayesian network structure discovery is a fundamental yet NP-hard problem in the field of probabilistic graphical models, and as the number of variables increases, memory usage grows exponentially. The simple and effective method proposed by Silander and Myllym\"aki has been widely applied in this field, as it incrementally calculates local scores to achieve global optimality. However, existing methods that utilize disk storage, while capable of handling networks with a larger number of variables, introduce issues such as latency, fragmentation, and additional overhead associated with disk I/O operations. To avoid these problems, we explore how to further enhance computational efficiency and reduce peak memory usage using only memory. We introduce an efficient hierarchical computation method that requires only a single traversal of all local structures, retaining only the data and information necessary for the current computation, thereby improving efficiency and significantly reducing memory requirements. Experimental results indicate that our method, when using only memory, not only reduces peak memory usage but also improves computational efficiency compared to existing methods, demonstrating good scalability for handling larger networks and exhibiting stable experimental results. Ultimately, we successfully achieved the processing of a Bayesian network with 28 variables using only memory.</description>

      <title>OVR: A Dataset for Open Vocabulary Temporal Repetition Counting in Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dataset of annotations of temporal repetitions in videos. The dataset, OVR (pronounced as over), contains annotations for over 72K videos, with each annotation specifying the number of repetitions, the start and end time of the repetitions, and also a free-form description of what is repeating. The annotations are provided for videos sourced from Kinetics and Ego4D, and consequently cover both Exo and Ego viewing conditions, with a huge variety of actions and activities. Moreover, OVR is almost an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets for video repetition. We also propose a baseline transformer-based counting model, OVRCounter, that can localise and count repetitions in videos that are up to 320 frames long. The model is trained and evaluated on the OVR dataset, and its performance assessed with and without using text to specify the target class to count. The performance is also compared to a prior repetition counting model. The dataset is available for download at: https://sites.google.com/view/openvocabreps/</description>

      <title>Assessing Non-Nested Configurations of Multifidelity Machine Learning for Quantum-Chemical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multifidelity machine learning (MFML) for quantum chemical (QC) properties has seen strong development in the recent years. The method has been shown to reduce the cost of generating training data for high-accuracy low-cost ML models. In such a set-up, the ML models are trained on molecular geometries and some property of interest computed at various computational chemistry accuracies, or fidelities. These are then combined in training the MFML models. In some multifidelity models, the training data is required to be nested, that is the same molecular geometries are included to calculate the property across all the fidelities. In these multifidelity models, the requirement of a nested configuration restricts the kind of sampling that can be performed while selection training samples at different fidelities.
  This work assesses the use of non-nested training data for two of these multifidelity methods, namely MFML and optimized MFML (o-MFML). The assessment is carried out for the prediction of ground state energies and first vertical excitation energies of a diverse collection of molecules of the CheMFi dataset. Results indicate that the MFML method still requires a nested structure of training data across the fidelities. However, the o-MFML method shows promising results for non-nested multifidelity training data with model errors comparable to the nested configurations.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Testing: Can Large Language Models Implicitly Resolve Ambiguous Entities?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the major aspects contributing to the striking performance of large language models (LLMs) is the vast amount of factual knowledge accumulated during pre-training. Yet, many LLMs suffer from self-inconsistency, which raises doubts about their trustworthiness and reliability. In this paper, we focus on entity type ambiguity and analyze current state-of-the-art LLMs for their proficiency and consistency in applying their factual knowledge when prompted for entities under ambiguity. To do so, we propose an evaluation protocol that disentangles knowing from applying knowledge, and test state-of-the-art LLMs on 49 entities. Our experiments reveal that LLMs perform poorly with ambiguous prompts, achieving only 80% accuracy. Our results further demonstrate systematic discrepancies in LLM behavior and their failure to consistently apply information, indicating that the models can exhibit knowledge without being able to utilize it, significant biases for preferred readings, as well as self inconsistencies. Our study highlights the importance of handling entity ambiguity in future for more trustworthy LLMs</description>

      <title>NarrationDep: Narratives on Social Media For Automatic Depression Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media posts provide valuable insight into the narrative of users and their intentions, including providing an opportunity to automatically model whether a social media user is depressed or not. The challenge lies in faithfully modelling user narratives from their online social media posts, which could potentially be useful in several different applications. We have developed a novel and effective model called \texttt{NarrationDep}, which focuses on detecting narratives associated with depression. By analyzing a user's tweets, \texttt{NarrationDep} accurately identifies crucial narratives. \texttt{NarrationDep} is a deep learning framework that jointly models individual user tweet representations and clusters of users' tweets. As a result, \texttt{NarrationDep} is characterized by a novel two-layer deep learning model: the first layer models using social media text posts, and the second layer learns semantic representations of tweets associated with a cluster. To faithfully model these cluster representations, the second layer incorporates a novel component that hierarchically learns from users' posts. The results demonstrate that our framework outperforms other comparative models including recently developed models on a variety of datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an optimization algorithm to improve the design and performance of quantum communication networks. When physical architectures become too complex for analytical methods, numerical simulation becomes essential to study quantum network behavior. Although highly informative, these simulations involve complex numerical functions without known analytical forms, making traditional optimization techniques that assume continuity, differentiability, or convexity inapplicable. Additionally, quantum network simulations are computationally demanding, rendering global approaches like Simulated Annealing or genetic algorithms,
  which require extensive function evaluations, impractical. We introduce a more efficient optimization workflow using machine learning models, which serve as surrogates for a given objective function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to three well-known optimization problems in quantum networking: quantum memory allocation for multiple network nodes, tuning an experimental parameter in all physical links of a quantum entanglement switch, and finding efficient protocol settings within a large asymmetric quantum network. The solutions found by our algorithm consistently outperform those obtained with our baseline approaches -- Simulated Annealing and Bayesian optimization -- in the allotted time limit by up to 18\% and 20\%, respectively. Our framework thus allows for more comprehensive quantum network studies, integrating surrogate-assisted optimization with existing quantum network simulators.</description>

      <title>Generalization Bounds of Surrogate Policies for Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent stream of structured learning approaches has improved the practical state of the art for a range of combinatorial optimization problems with complex objectives encountered in operations research. Such approaches train policies that chain a statistical model with a surrogate combinatorial optimization oracle to map any instance of the problem to a feasible solution. The key idea is to exploit the statistical distribution over instances instead of dealing with instances separately. However learning such policies by risk minimization is challenging because the empirical risk is piecewise constant in the parameters, and few theoretical guarantees have been provided so far. In this article, we investigate methods that smooth the risk by perturbing the policy, which eases optimization and improves generalization. Our main contribution is a generalization bound that controls the perturbation bias, the statistical learning error, and the optimization error. Our analysis relies on the introduction of a uniform weak property, which captures and quantifies the interplay of the statistical model and the surrogate combinatorial optimization oracle. This property holds under mild assumptions on the statistical model, the surrogate optimization, and the instance data distribution. We illustrate the result on a range of applications such as stochastic vehicle scheduling. In particular, such policies are relevant for contextual stochastic optimization and our results cover this case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel computational approach for analyzing nonverbal social behavior in educational settings. Integrating multimodal behavioral cues, including facial expressions, gesture intensity, and spatial dynamics, the model assesses the nonverbal immediacy (NVI) of teachers from RGB classroom videos. A dataset of 400 30-second video segments from German classrooms was constructed for model training and validation. The gesture intensity regressor achieved a correlation of 0.84, the perceived distance regressor 0.55, and the NVI model 0.44 with median human ratings. The model demonstrates the potential to provide a valuable support in nonverbal behavior assessment, approximating the accuracy of individual human raters. Validated against both questionnaire data and trained observer ratings, our models show moderate to strong correlations with relevant educational outcomes, indicating their efficacy in reflecting effective teaching behaviors. This research advances the objective assessment of nonverbal communication behaviors, opening new pathways for educational research.</description>

Abstract: We propose a combination of machine learning and flux limiting for property-preserving subgrid scale modeling in the context of flux-limited finite volume methods for the one-dimensional shallow-water equations. The numerical fluxes of a conservative target scheme are fitted to the coarse-mesh averages of a monotone fine-grid discretization using a neural network to parametrize the subgrid scale components. To ensure positivity preservation and the validity of local maximum principles, we use a flux limiter that constrains the intermediate states of an equivalent fluctuation form to stay in a convex admissible set. The results of our numerical studies confirm that the proposed combination of machine learning with monolithic convex limiting produces meaningful closures even in scenarios for which the network was not trained.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores a specific type of nonconvex sparsity-promoting regularization problems, namely those involving $\ell_p$-norm regularization, in conjunction with a twice continuously differentiable loss function. We propose a novel second-order algorithm designed to effectively address this class of challenging nonconvex and nonsmooth problems, showcasing several innovative features: (i) The use of an alternating strategy to solve a reweighted $\ell_1$ regularized subproblem and the subspace approximate Newton step. (ii) The reweighted $\ell_1$ regularized subproblem relies on a convex approximation to the nonconvex regularization term, enabling a closed-form solution characterized by the soft-thresholding operator. This feature allows our method to be applied to various nonconvex regularization problems. (iii) Our algorithm ensures that the iterates maintain their sign values and that nonzero components are kept away from 0 for a sufficient number of iterations, eventually transitioning to a perturbed Newton method. (iv) We provide theoretical guarantees of global convergence, local superlinear convergence in the presence of the Kurdyka-\L ojasiewicz (KL) property, and local quadratic convergence when employing the exact Newton step in our algorithm. We also showcase the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on a diverse set of model prediction problems.</description>

Abstract: Federated learning is becoming an increasingly viable and accepted strategy for building machine learning models in critical privacy-preserving scenarios such as clinical settings. Often, the data involved is not limited to clinical data but also includes additional omics features (e.g. proteomics). Consequently, data is distributed not only across hospitals but also across omics centers, which are labs capable of generating such additional features from biosamples. This scenario leads to a hybrid setting where data is scattered both in terms of samples and features. In this hybrid setting, we present an efficient reformulation of the Kernel Regularized Least Squares algorithm, introduce two variants and validate them using well-established datasets. Lastly, we discuss security measures to defend against possible attacks.</description>

Abstract: In the domain of rotating machinery, bearings are vulnerable to different mechanical faults, including ball, inner, and outer race faults. Various techniques can be used in condition-based monitoring, from classical signal analysis to deep learning methods. Based on the complex working conditions of rotary machines, multivariate statistical process control charts such as Hotelling's $T^2$ and Squared Prediction Error are useful for providing early warnings. However, these methods are rarely applied to condition monitoring of rotating machinery due to the univariate nature of the datasets. In the present paper, we propose a multivariate statistical process control-based fault detection method that utilizes multivariate data composed of Fourier transform features extracted for fixed-time batches. Our approach makes use of the multidimensional nature of Fourier transform characteristics, which record more detailed information about the machine's status, in an effort to enhance early defect detection and diagnosis. Experiments with varying vibration measurement locations (Fan End, Drive End), fault types (ball, inner, and outer race faults), and motor loads (0-3 horsepower) are used to validate the suggested approach. The outcomes illustrate our method's effectiveness in fault detection and point to possible broader uses in industrial maintenance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant progress in recent years, but the choice of visual feature extractor remains a crucial design decision. This paper compares the performance of RL algorithms that train a convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch with those that utilize pre-trained visual representations (PVRs). We evaluate the Dormant Ratio Minimization (DRM) algorithm, a state-of-the-art visual RL method, against three PVRs: ResNet18, DINOv2, and Visual Cortex (VC). We use the Metaworld Push-v2 and Drawer-Open-v2 tasks for our comparison. Our results show that the choice of training from scratch compared to using PVRs for maximising performance is task-dependent, but PVRs offer advantages in terms of reduced replay buffer size and faster training times. We also identify a strong correlation between the dormant ratio and model performance, highlighting the importance of exploration in visual RL. Our study provides insights into the trade-offs between training from scratch and using PVRs, informing the design of future visual RL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Feature Learning via Regularisation: Integrating Neural Networks and Kernel Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method for feature learning and function estimation in supervised learning via regularised empirical risk minimisation. Our approach considers functions as expectations of Sobolev functions over all possible one-dimensional projections of the data. This framework is similar to kernel ridge regression, where the kernel is $\mathbb{E}_w ( k^{(B)}(w^\top x,w^\top x^\prime))$, with $k^{(B)}(a,b) := \min(|a|, |b|)1_{ab&gt;0}$ the Brownian kernel, and the distribution of the projections $w$ is learnt. This can also be viewed as an infinite-width one-hidden layer neural network, optimising the first layer's weights through gradient descent and explicitly adjusting the non-linearity and weights of the second layer. We introduce an efficient computation method for the estimator, called Brownian Kernel Neural Network (BKerNN), using particles to approximate the expectation. The optimisation is principled due to the positive homogeneity of the Brownian kernel. Using Rademacher complexity, we show that BKerNN's expected risk converges to the minimal risk with explicit high-probability rates of $O( \min((d/n)^{1/2}, n^{-1/6}))$ (up to logarithmic factors). Numerical experiments confirm our optimisation intuitions, and BKerNN outperforms kernel ridge regression, and favourably compares to a one-hidden layer neural network with ReLU activations in various settings and real data sets.</description>

      <title>Enhanced SMC$^2$: Leveraging Gradient Information from Differentiable Particle Filters Within Langevin Proposals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential Monte Carlo Squared (SMC$^2$) is a Bayesian method which can infer the states and parameters of non-linear, non-Gaussian state-space models. The standard random-walk proposal in SMC$^2$ faces challenges, particularly with high-dimensional parameter spaces. This study outlines a novel approach by harnessing first-order gradients derived from a Common Random Numbers - Particle Filter (CRN-PF) using PyTorch. The resulting gradients can be leveraged within a Langevin proposal without accept/reject. Including Langevin dynamics within the proposal can result in a higher effective sample size and more accurate parameter estimates when compared with the random-walk. The resulting algorithm is parallelized on distributed memory using Message Passing Interface (MPI) and runs in $\mathcal{O}(\log_2N)$ time complexity. Utilizing 64 computational cores we obtain a 51x speed-up when compared to a single core. A GitHub link is given which provides access to the code.</description>

      <title>Low dimensional representation of multi-patient flow cytometry datasets using optimal transport for minimal residual disease detection in leukemia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representing and quantifying Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, is essential in the prognosis and follow-up of AML patients. As traditional cytological analysis cannot detect leukemia cells below 5\%, the analysis of flow cytometry dataset is expected to provide more reliable results. In this paper, we explore statistical learning methods based on optimal transport (OT) to achieve a relevant low-dimensional representation of multi-patient flow cytometry measurements (FCM) datasets considered as high-dimensional probability distributions. Using the framework of OT, we justify the use of the K-means algorithm for dimensionality reduction of multiple large-scale point clouds through mean measure quantization by merging all the data into a single point cloud. After this quantization step, the visualization of the intra and inter-patients FCM variability is carried out by embedding low-dimensional quantized probability measures into a linear space using either Wasserstein Principal Component Analysis (PCA) through linearized OT or log-ratio PCA of compositional data. Using a publicly available FCM dataset and a FCM dataset from Bordeaux University Hospital, we demonstrate the benefits of our approach over the popular kernel mean embedding technique for statistical learning from multiple high-dimensional probability distributions. We also highlight the usefulness of our methodology for low-dimensional projection and clustering patient measurements according to their level of MRD in AML from FCM. In particular, our OT-based approach allows a relevant and informative two-dimensional representation of the results of the FlowSom algorithm, a state-of-the-art method for the detection of MRD in AML using multi-patient FCM.</description>

      <title>Mathematical programming algorithms for convex hull approximation with a hyperplane budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the following problem in computational geometry: given, in the d-dimensional real space, a set of points marked as positive and a set of points marked as negative, such that the convex hull of the positive set does not intersect the negative set, find K hyperplanes that separate, if possible, all the positive points from the negative ones. That is, we search for a convex polyhedron with at most K faces, containing all the positive points and no negative point. The problem is known in the literature for pure convex polyhedral approximation; our interest stems from its possible applications in constraint learning, where points are feasible or infeasible solutions of a Mixed Integer Program, and the K hyperplanes are linear constraints to be found. We cast the problem as an optimization one, minimizing the number of negative points inside the convex polyhedron, whenever exact separation cannot be achieved. We introduce models inspired by support vector machines and we design two mathematical programming formulations with binary variables. We exploit Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition to obtain extended formulations, and we devise column generation algorithms with ad-hoc pricing routines. We compare computing time and separation error values obtained by all our approaches on synthetic datasets, with number of points from hundreds up to a few thousands, showing our approaches to perform better than existing ones from the literature. Furthermore, we observe that key computational differences arise, depending on whether the budget K is sufficient to completely separate the positive points from the negative ones or not. On 8-dimensional instances (and over), existing convex hull algorithms become computational inapplicable, while our algorithms allow to identify good convex hull approximations in minutes of computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in engineering problems calls for the development of calibration methods capable of offering robust statistical reliability guarantees. The calibration of black box AI models is carried out via the optimization of hyperparameters dictating architecture, optimization, and/or inference configuration. Prior work has introduced learn-then-test (LTT), a calibration procedure for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) that provides statistical guarantees on average performance measures. Recognizing the importance of controlling risk-aware objectives in engineering contexts, this work introduces a variant of LTT that is designed to provide statistical guarantees on quantiles of a risk measure. We illustrate the practical advantages of this approach by applying the proposed algorithm to a radio access scheduling problem.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Approach to Misspelling Correction with BERT and Levenshtein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Writing, as an omnipresent form of human communication, permeates nearly every aspect of contemporary life. Consequently, inaccuracies or errors in written communication can lead to profound consequences, ranging from financial losses to potentially life-threatening situations. Spelling mistakes, among the most prevalent writing errors, are frequently encountered due to various factors. This research aims to identify and rectify diverse spelling errors in text using neural networks, specifically leveraging the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) masked language model. To achieve this goal, we compiled a comprehensive dataset encompassing both non-real-word and real-word errors after categorizing different types of spelling mistakes. Subsequently, multiple pre-trained BERT models were employed. To ensure optimal performance in correcting misspelling errors, we propose a combined approach utilizing the BERT masked language model and Levenshtein distance. The results from our evaluation data demonstrate that the system presented herein exhibits remarkable capabilities in identifying and rectifying spelling mistakes, often surpassing existing systems tailored for the Persian language.</description>

      <title>Causal modelling without counterfactuals and individualised effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most common approach to causal modelling is the potential outcomes framework due to Neyman and Rubin. In this framework, outcomes of counterfactual treatments are assumed to be well-defined. This metaphysical assumption is often thought to be problematic yet indispensable. The conventional approach relies not only on counterfactuals, but also on abstract notions of distributions and assumptions of independence that are not directly testable. In this paper, we construe causal inference as treatment-wise predictions for finite populations where all assumptions are testable; this means that one can not only test predictions themselves (without any fundamental problem), but also investigate sources of error when they fail. The new framework highlights the model-dependence of causal claims as well as the difference between statistical and scientific inference.</description>

      <title>Systematic Reasoning About Relational Domains With Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing models that can learn to reason is a notoriously challenging problem. We focus on reasoning in relational domains, where the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) seems like a natural choice. However, previous work on reasoning with GNNs has shown that such models tend to fail when presented with test examples that require longer inference chains than those seen during training. This suggests that GNNs lack the ability to generalize from training examples in a systematic way, which would fundamentally limit their reasoning abilities. A common solution is to instead rely on neuro-symbolic methods, which are capable of reasoning in a systematic way by design. Unfortunately, the scalability of such methods is often limited and they tend to rely on overly strong assumptions, e.g.\ that queries can be answered by inspecting a single relational path. In this paper, we revisit the idea of reasoning with GNNs, showing that systematic generalization is possible as long as the right inductive bias is provided. In particular, we argue that node embeddings should be treated as epistemic states and that GNN should be parameterised accordingly. We propose a simple GNN architecture which is based on this view and show that it is capable of achieving state-of-the-art results. We furthermore introduce a benchmark which requires models to aggregate evidence from multiple relational paths. We show that existing neuro-symbolic approaches fail on this benchmark, whereas our considered GNN model learns to reason accurately.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-preserving deep knowledge tracing with state-space models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central goal of both knowledge tracing and traditional assessment is to quantify student knowledge and skills at a given point in time. Deep knowledge tracing flexibly considers a student's response history but does not quantify epistemic uncertainty, while IRT and CDM compute measurement error but only consider responses to individual tests in isolation from a student's past responses. Elo and BKT could bridge this divide, but the simplicity of the underlying models limits information sharing across skills and imposes strong inductive biases. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dynamic LENS, a modeling paradigm that combines the flexible uncertainty-preserving properties of variational autoencoders with the principled information integration of Bayesian state-space models. Dynamic LENS allows information from student responses to be collected across time, while treating responses from the same test as exchangeable observations generated by a shared latent state. It represents student knowledge as Gaussian distributions in high-dimensional space and combines estimates both within tests and across time using Bayesian updating. We show that Dynamic LENS has similar predictive performance to competing models, while preserving the epistemic uncertainty - the deep learning analogue to measurement error - that DKT models lack. This approach provides a conceptual bridge across an important divide between models designed for formative practice and summative assessment.</description>

      <title>HumanVid: Demystifying Training Data for Camera-controllable Human Image Animation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human image animation involves generating videos from a character photo, allowing user control and unlocking potential for video and movie production. While recent approaches yield impressive results using high-quality training data, the inaccessibility of these datasets hampers fair and transparent benchmarking. Moreover, these approaches prioritize 2D human motion and overlook the significance of camera motions in videos, leading to limited control and unstable video generation.To demystify the training data, we present HumanVid, the first large-scale high-quality dataset tailored for human image animation, which combines crafted real-world and synthetic data. For the real-world data, we compile a vast collection of copyright-free real-world videos from the internet. Through a carefully designed rule-based filtering strategy, we ensure the inclusion of high-quality videos, resulting in a collection of 20K human-centric videos in 1080P resolution. Human and camera motion annotation is accomplished using a 2D pose estimator and a SLAM-based method. For the synthetic data, we gather 2,300 copyright-free 3D avatar assets to augment existing available 3D assets. Notably, we introduce a rule-based camera trajectory generation method, enabling the synthetic pipeline to incorporate diverse and precise camera motion annotation, which can rarely be found in real-world data. To verify the effectiveness of HumanVid, we establish a baseline model named CamAnimate, short for Camera-controllable Human Animation, that considers both human and camera motions as conditions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that such simple baseline training on our HumanVid achieves state-of-the-art performance in controlling both human pose and camera motions, setting a new benchmark. Code and data will be publicly available at \url{https://github.com/zhenzhiwang/HumanVid/}.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel generalisation of the signature of a path, motivated by fractional calculus, which is able to describe the solutions of linear Caputo controlled FDEs. We also propose another generalisation of the signature, inspired by the previous one, but more convenient to use in machine learning. Finally, we test this last signature in a toy application to the problem of handwritten digit recognition, where significant improvements in accuracy rates are observed compared to those of the original signature.</description>

      <title>SoNIC: Safe Social Navigation with Adaptive Conformal Inference and Constrained Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled social robots to generate trajectories without human-designed rules or interventions, which makes it more effective than hard-coded systems for generalizing to complex real-world scenarios. However, social navigation is a safety-critical task that requires robots to avoid collisions with pedestrians while previous RL-based solutions fall short in safety performance in complex environments. To enhance the safety of RL policies, to the best of our knowledge, we propose the first algorithm, SoNIC, that integrates adaptive conformal inference (ACI) with constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) to learn safe policies for social navigation. More specifically, our method augments RL observations with ACI-generated nonconformity scores and provides explicit guidance for agents to leverage the uncertainty metrics to avoid safety-critical areas by incorporating safety constraints with spatial relaxation. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both safety and adherence to social norms by a large margin and demonstrates much stronger robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios. Our code and video demos are available on our project website: https://sonic-social-nav.github.io/.</description>

      <title>CMR Scaling Law: Predicting Critical Mixture Ratios for Continual Pre-training of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in diverse tasks but often underperform in specialized fields due to limited domain-specific or proprietary corpus. Continual pre-training (CPT) enhances LLM capabilities by imbuing new domain-specific or proprietary knowledge while replaying general corpus to prevent catastrophic forgetting. The data mixture ratio of general corpus and domain-specific corpus, however, has been chosen heuristically, leading to sub-optimal training efficiency in practice. In this context, we attempt to re-visit the scaling behavior of LLMs under the hood of CPT, and discover a power-law relationship between loss, mixture ratio, and training tokens scale. We formalize the trade-off between general and domain-specific capabilities, leading to a well-defined Critical Mixture Ratio (CMR) of general and domain data. By striking the balance, CMR maintains the model's general ability and achieves the desired domain transfer, ensuring the highest utilization of available resources. Therefore, if we value the balance between efficiency and effectiveness, CMR can be consider as the optimal mixture ratio.Through extensive experiments, we ascertain the predictability of CMR, and propose CMR scaling law and have substantiated its generalization. These findings offer practical guidelines for optimizing LLM training in specialized domains, ensuring both general and domain-specific performance while efficiently managing training resources.</description>

Abstract: We show that any memory-constrained, first-order algorithm which minimizes $d$-dimensional, $1$-Lipschitz convex functions over the unit ball to $1/\mathrm{poly}(d)$ accuracy using at most $d^{1.25 - \delta}$ bits of memory must make at least $\tilde{\Omega}(d^{1 + (4/3)\delta})$ first-order queries (for any constant $\delta \in [0, 1/4]$). Consequently, the performance of such memory-constrained algorithms are a polynomial factor worse than the optimal $\tilde{O}(d)$ query bound for this problem obtained by cutting plane methods that use $\tilde{O}(d^2)$ memory. This resolves a COLT 2019 open problem of Woodworth and Srebro.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.09615v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classification tasks are usually evaluated in terms of accuracy. However, accuracy is discontinuous and cannot be directly optimized using gradient ascent. Popular methods minimize cross-entropy, hinge loss, or other surrogate losses, which can lead to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a new optimization framework by introducing stochasticity to a model's output and optimizing expected accuracy, i.e. accuracy of the stochastic model. Extensive experiments on linear models and deep image classification show that the proposed optimization method is a powerful alternative to widely used classification losses.</description>

Abstract: Modern advanced manufacturing and advanced materials design often require searches of relatively high-dimensional process control parameter spaces for settings that result in optimal structure, property, and performance parameters. The mapping from the former to the latter must be determined from noisy experiments or from expensive simulations. We abstract this problem to a mathematical framework in which an unknown function from a control space to a design space must be ascertained by means of expensive noisy measurements, which locate optimal control settings generating desired design features within specified tolerances, with quantified uncertainty. We describe targeted adaptive design (TAD), a new algorithm that performs this sampling task efficiently. TAD creates a Gaussian process surrogate model of the unknown mapping at each iterative stage, proposing a new batch of control settings to sample experimentally and optimizing the updated log-predictive likelihood of the target design. TAD either stops upon locating a solution with uncertainties that fit inside the tolerance box or uses a measure of expected future information to determine that the search space has been exhausted with no solution. TAD thus embodies the exploration-exploitation tension in a manner that recalls, but is essentially different from, Bayesian optimization and optimal experimental design.</description>

      <title>Active Learning of Piecewise Gaussian Process Surrogates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active learning of Gaussian process (GP) surrogates has been useful for optimizing experimental designs for physical/computer simulation experiments, and for steering data acquisition schemes in machine learning. In this paper, we develop a method for active learning of piecewise, Jump GP surrogates. Jump GPs are continuous within, but discontinuous across, regions of a design space, as required for applications spanning autonomous materials design, configuration of smart factory systems, and many others. Although our active learning heuristics are appropriated from strategies originally designed for ordinary GPs, we demonstrate that additionally accounting for model bias, as opposed to the usual model uncertainty, is essential in the Jump GP context. Toward that end, we develop an estimator for bias and variance of Jump GP models. Illustrations, and evidence of the advantage of our proposed methods, are provided on a suite of synthetic benchmarks, and real-simulation experiments of varying complexity.</description>

Abstract: Label-efficient time series representation learning, which aims to learn effective representations with limited labeled data, is crucial for deploying deep learning models in real-world applications. To address the scarcity of labeled time series data, various strategies, e.g., transfer learning, self-supervised learning, and semi-supervised learning, have been developed. In this survey, we introduce a novel taxonomy for the first time, categorizing existing approaches as in-domain or cross-domain, based on their reliance on external data sources or not. Furthermore, we present a review of the recent advances in each strategy, conclude the limitations of current methodologies, and suggest future research directions that promise further improvements in the field.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-augmented Graph Machine Learning for Drug Discovery: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the field of drug discovery has been a growing area of interdisciplinary scientific research. However, conventional AI models are heavily limited in handling complex biomedical structures (such as 2D or 3D protein and molecule structures) and providing interpretations for outputs, which hinders their practical application. As of late, Graph Machine Learning (GML) has gained considerable attention for its exceptional ability to model graph-structured biomedical data and investigate their properties and functional relationships. Despite extensive efforts, GML methods still suffer from several deficiencies, such as the limited ability to handle supervision sparsity and provide interpretability in learning and inference processes, and their ineffectiveness in utilising relevant domain knowledge. In response, recent studies have proposed integrating external biomedical knowledge into the GML pipeline to realise more precise and interpretable drug discovery with limited training instances. However, a systematic definition for this burgeoning research direction is yet to be established. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of long-standing drug discovery principles, provides the foundational concepts and cutting-edge techniques for graph-structured data and knowledge databases, and formally summarises Knowledge-augmented Graph Machine Learning (KaGML) for drug discovery. we propose a thorough review of related KaGML works, collected following a carefully designed search methodology, and organise them into four categories following a novel-defined taxonomy. To facilitate research in this promptly emerging field, we also share collected practical resources that are valuable for intelligent drug discovery and provide an in-depth discussion of the potential avenues for future advancements.</description>

      <title>Fourier-MIONet: Fourier-enhanced multiple-input neural operators for multiphase modeling of geological carbon sequestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geologic carbon sequestration (GCS) is a safety-critical technology that aims to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which also places high demands on reliability. Multiphase flow in porous media is essential to understand CO$_2$ migration and pressure fields in the subsurface associated with GCS. However, numerical simulation for such problems in 4D is computationally challenging and expensive, due to the multiphysics and multiscale nature of the highly nonlinear governing partial differential equations (PDEs). It prevents us from considering multiple subsurface scenarios and conducting real-time optimization. Here, we develop a Fourier-enhanced multiple-input neural operator (Fourier-MIONet) to learn the solution operator of the problem of multiphase flow in porous media. Fourier-MIONet utilizes the recently developed framework of the multiple-input deep neural operators (MIONet) and incorporates the Fourier neural operator (FNO) in the network architecture. Once Fourier-MIONet is trained, it can predict the evolution of saturation and pressure of the multiphase flow under various reservoir conditions, such as permeability and porosity heterogeneity, anisotropy, injection configurations, and multiphase flow properties. Compared to the enhanced FNO (U-FNO), the proposed Fourier-MIONet has 90% fewer unknown parameters, and it can be trained in significantly less time (about 3.5 times faster) with much lower CPU memory ($&lt;$ 15%) and GPU memory ($&lt;$ 35%) requirements, to achieve similar prediction accuracy. In addition to the lower computational cost, Fourier-MIONet can be trained with only 6 snapshots of time to predict the PDE solutions for 30 years. The excellent generalizability of Fourier-MIONet is enabled by its adherence to the physical principle that the solution to a PDE is continuous over time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study Euler characteristic techniques in topological data analysis. Pointwise computing the Euler characteristic of a family of simplicial complexes built from data gives rise to the so-called Euler characteristic profile. We show that this simple descriptor achieve state-of-the-art performance in supervised tasks at a very low computational cost. Inspired by signal analysis, we compute hybrid transforms of Euler characteristic profiles. These integral transforms mix Euler characteristic techniques with Lebesgue integration to provide highly efficient compressors of topological signals. As a consequence, they show remarkable performances in unsupervised settings. On the qualitative side, we provide numerous heuristics on the topological and geometric information captured by Euler profiles and their hybrid transforms. Finally, we prove stability results for these descriptors as well as asymptotic guarantees in random settings.</description>

      <title>Optimizer's Information Criterion: Dissecting and Correcting Bias in Data-Driven Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In data-driven optimization, the sample performance of the obtained decision typically incurs an optimistic bias against the true performance, a phenomenon commonly known as the Optimizer's Curse and intimately related to overfitting in machine learning. Common techniques to correct this bias, such as cross-validation, require repeatedly solving additional optimization problems and are therefore computationally expensive. We develop a general bias correction approach, building on what we call Optimizer's Information Criterion (OIC), that directly approximates the first-order bias and does not require solving any additional optimization problems. Our OIC generalizes the celebrated Akaike Information Criterion to evaluate the objective performance in data-driven optimization, which crucially involves not only model fitting but also its interplay with the downstream optimization. As such it can be used for decision selection instead of only model selection. We apply our approach to a range of data-driven optimization formulations comprising empirical and parametric models, their regularized counterparts, and furthermore contextual optimization. Finally, we provide numerical validation on the superior performance of our approach under synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Detecting Throat Cancer from Speech Signals using Machine Learning: A Scoping Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introduction: Cases of throat cancer are rising worldwide. With survival decreasing significantly at later stages, early detection is vital. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have the potential to detect throat cancer from patient speech, facilitating earlier diagnosis and reducing the burden on overstretched healthcare systems. However, no comprehensive review has explored the use of AI and ML for detecting throat cancer from speech. This review aims to fill this gap by evaluating how these technologies perform and identifying issues that need to be addressed in future research. Materials and Methods: We conducted a scoping literature review across three databases: Scopus,Web of Science, and PubMed. We included articles that classified speech using machine learning and specified the inclusion of throat cancer patients in their data. Articles were categorized based on whether they performed binary or multi-class classification. Results: We found 27 articles fitting our inclusion criteria, 12 performing binary classification, 13 performing multi-class classification, and two that do both binary and multiclass classification. The most common classification method used was neural networks, and the most frequently extracted feature was mel-spectrograms. We also documented pre-processing methods and classifier performance. We compared each article against the TRIPOD-AI checklist, which showed a significant lack of open science, with only one article sharing code and only three using open-access data. Conclusion: Open-source code is essential for external validation and further development in this field. Our review indicates that no single method or specific feature consistently outperforms others in detecting throat cancer from speech. Future research should focus on standardizing methodologies and improving the reproducibility of results.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Structure-Aware Hamiltonian (Graph) Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04885v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the assumption of a fixed embedding manifold often limits their adaptability to diverse graph geometries. Recently, Hamiltonian system-inspired GNNs have been proposed to address the dynamic nature of such embeddings by incorporating physical laws into node feature updates. We present Symplectic Structure-Aware Hamiltonian GNN (SAH-GNN), a novel approach that generalizes Hamiltonian dynamics for more flexible node feature updates. Unlike existing Hamiltonian approaches, SAH-GNN employs Riemannian optimization on the symplectic Stiefel manifold to adaptively learn the underlying symplectic structure, circumventing the limitations of existing Hamiltonian GNNs that rely on a pre-defined form of standard symplectic structure. This innovation allows SAH-GNN to automatically adapt to various graph datasets without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, it conserves energy during training meaning the implicit Hamiltonian system is physically meaningful. Finally, we empirically validate SAH-GNN's superiority and adaptability in node classification tasks across multiple types of graph datasets.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Continual Learning with Bayesian Adaptive Moment Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pursuit of long-term autonomy mandates that machine learning models must continuously adapt to their changing environments and learn to solve new tasks. Continual learning seeks to overcome the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where learning to solve new tasks causes a model to forget previously learnt information. Prior-based continual learning methods are appealing as they are computationally efficient and do not require auxiliary models or data storage. However, prior-based approaches typically fail on important benchmarks and are thus limited in their potential applications compared to their memory-based counterparts. We introduce Bayesian adaptive moment regularization (BAdam), a novel prior-based method that better constrains parameter growth, reducing catastrophic forgetting. Our method boasts a range of desirable properties such as being lightweight and task label-free, converging quickly, and offering calibrated uncertainty that is important for safe real-world deployment. Results show that BAdam achieves state-of-the-art performance for prior-based methods on challenging single-headed class-incremental experiments such as Split MNIST and Split FashionMNIST, and does so without relying on task labels or discrete task boundaries.</description>

      <title>On the Trade-offs between Adversarial Robustness and Actionable Explanations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly being employed in various high-stakes settings, it becomes important to ensure that predictions of these models are not only adversarially robust, but also readily explainable to relevant stakeholders. However, it is unclear if these two notions can be simultaneously achieved or if there exist trade-offs between them. In this work, we make one of the first attempts at studying the impact of adversarially robust models on actionable explanations which provide end users with a means for recourse. We theoretically and empirically analyze the cost (ease of implementation) and validity (probability of obtaining a positive model prediction) of recourses output by state-of-the-art algorithms when the underlying models are adversarially robust vs. non-robust. More specifically, we derive theoretical bounds on the differences between the cost and the validity of the recourses generated by state-of-the-art algorithms for adversarially robust vs. non-robust linear and non-linear models. Our empirical results with multiple real-world datasets validate our theoretical results and show the impact of varying degrees of model robustness on the cost and validity of the resulting recourses. Our analyses demonstrate that adversarially robust models significantly increase the cost and reduce the validity of the resulting recourses, thus shedding light on the inherent trade-offs between adversarial robustness and actionable explanations.</description>

      <title>Watermarks in the Sand: Impossibility of Strong Watermarking for Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04378v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Watermarking generative models consists of planting a statistical signal (watermark) in a model's output so that it can be later verified that the output was generated by the given model. A strong watermarking scheme satisfies the property that a computationally bounded attacker cannot erase the watermark without causing significant quality degradation. In this paper, we study the (im)possibility of strong watermarking schemes. We prove that, under well-specified and natural assumptions, strong watermarking is impossible to achieve. This holds even in the private detection algorithm setting, where the watermark insertion and detection algorithms share a secret key, unknown to the attacker. To prove this result, we introduce a generic efficient watermark attack; the attacker is not required to know the private key of the scheme or even which scheme is used. Our attack is based on two assumptions: (1) The attacker has access to a "quality oracle" that can evaluate whether a candidate output is a high-quality response to a prompt, and (2) The attacker has access to a "perturbation oracle" which can modify an output with a nontrivial probability of maintaining quality, and which induces an efficiently mixing random walk on high-quality outputs. We argue that both assumptions can be satisfied in practice by an attacker with weaker computational capabilities than the watermarked model itself, to which the attacker has only black-box access. Furthermore, our assumptions will likely only be easier to satisfy over time as models grow in capabilities and modalities. We demonstrate the feasibility of our attack by instantiating it to attack three existing watermarking schemes for large language models: Kirchenbauer et al. (2023), Kuditipudi et al. (2023), and Zhao et al. (2023). The same attack successfully removes the watermarks planted by all three schemes, with only minor quality degradation.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Neural Networks Local Stability for Aircraft Predictive Maintenance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06821v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surrogate Neural Networks are nowadays routinely used in industry as substitutes for computationally demanding engineering simulations (e.g., in structural analysis). They allow to generate faster predictions and thus analyses in industrial applications e.g., during a product design, testing or monitoring phases. Due to their performance and time-efficiency, these surrogate models are now being developed for use in safety-critical applications. Neural network verification and in particular the assessment of their robustness (e.g., to perturbations) is the next critical step to allow their inclusion in real-life applications and certification. We assess the applicability and scalability of empirical and formal methods in the context of aircraft predictive maintenance for surrogate neural networks designed to predict the stress sustained by an aircraft part from external loads. The case study covers a high-dimensional input and output space and the verification process thus accommodates multi-objective constraints. We explore the complementarity of verification methods in assessing the local stability property of such surrogate models to input noise. We showcase the effectiveness of sequentially combining methods in one verification 'pipeline' and demonstrate the subsequent gain in runtime required to assess the targeted property.</description>

      <title>Boosting Gradient Ascent for Continuous DR-submodular Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projected Gradient Ascent (PGA) is the most commonly used optimization scheme in machine learning and operations research areas. Nevertheless, numerous studies and examples have shown that the PGA methods may fail to achieve the tight approximation ratio for continuous DR-submodular maximization problems. To address this challenge, we present a boosting technique in this paper, which can efficiently improve the approximation guarantee of the standard PGA to \emph{optimal} with only small modifications on the objective function. The fundamental idea of our boosting technique is to exploit non-oblivious search to derive a novel auxiliary function $F$, whose stationary points are excellent approximations to the global maximum of the original DR-submodular objective $f$. Specifically, when $f$ is monotone and $\gamma$-weakly DR-submodular, we propose an auxiliary function $F$ whose stationary points can provide a better $(1-e^{-\gamma})$-approximation than the $(\gamma^2/(1+\gamma^2))$-approximation guaranteed by the stationary points of $f$ itself. Similarly, for the non-monotone case, we devise another auxiliary function $F$ whose stationary points can achieve an optimal $\frac{1-\min_{\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathcal{C}}\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_{\infty}}{4}$-approximation guarantee where $\mathcal{C}$ is a convex constraint set. In contrast, the stationary points of the original non-monotone DR-submodular function can be arbitrarily bad~\citep{chen2023continuous}. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of our boosting technique on four problems. In all of these four problems, our resulting variants of boosting PGA algorithm beat the previous standard PGA in several aspects such as approximation ratio and efficiency. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our boosting PGA methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17505v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the probabilistic modeling performed by Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) through the angle of time directionality, addressing a question first raised in (Shannon, 1951). For large enough models, we empirically find a time asymmetry in their ability to learn natural language: a difference in the average log-perplexity when trying to predict the next token versus when trying to predict the previous one. This difference is at the same time subtle and very consistent across various modalities (language, model size, training time, ...). Theoretically, this is surprising: from an information-theoretic point of view, there should be no such difference. We provide a theoretical framework to explain how such an asymmetry can appear from sparsity and computational complexity considerations, and outline a number of perspectives opened by our results.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel family of decision-aware surrogate losses, called Perturbation Gradient (PG) losses, for the predict-then-optimize framework. The key idea is to connect the expected downstream decision loss with the directional derivative of a particular plug-in objective, and then approximate this derivative using zeroth order gradient techniques. Unlike the original decision loss which is typically piecewise constant and discontinuous, our new PG losses can be optimized using off-the-shelf gradient-based methods. Most importantly, unlike existing surrogate losses, the approximation error of our PG losses vanishes as the number of samples grows. Hence, optimizing our surrogate loss yields a best-in-class policy asymptotically, even in misspecified settings. This is the first such result in misspecified settings, and we provide numerical evidence confirming our PG losses substantively outperform existing proposals when the underlying model is misspecified.</description>

Abstract: Ensembles of separate neural networks (NNs) have shown superior accuracy and confidence calibration over single NN across tasks. To improve the hardware efficiency of ensembles of separate NNs, recent methods create ensembles within a single network via adding early exits or considering multi input multi output approaches. However, it is unclear which of these methods is the most effective for a given task, needing a manual and separate search through each method. Our novel Single Architecture Ensemble (SAE) framework enables an automatic and joint search through the early exit and multi input multi output configurations and their previously unobserved in-between combinations. SAE consists of two parts: a scalable search space that generalises the previous methods and their in-between configurations, and an optimisation objective that allows learning the optimal configuration for a given task. Our image classification and regression experiments show that with SAE we can automatically find diverse configurations that fit the task, achieving competitive accuracy or confidence calibration to baselines while reducing the compute operations or parameter count by up to $1.5{\sim}3.7\times$.</description>

      <title>Solving Deep Reinforcement Learning Tasks with Evolution Strategies and Linear Policy Networks</title>

Abstract: Although deep reinforcement learning methods can learn effective policies for challenging problems such as Atari games and robotics tasks, algorithms are complex, and training times are often long. This study investigates how Evolution Strategies perform compared to gradient-based deep reinforcement learning methods. We use Evolution Strategies to optimize the weights of a neural network via neuroevolution, performing direct policy search. We benchmark both deep policy networks and networks consisting of a single linear layer from observations to actions for three gradient-based methods, such as Proximal Policy Optimization. These methods are evaluated against three classical Evolution Strategies and Augmented Random Search, which all use linear policy networks. Our results reveal that Evolution Strategies can find effective linear policies for many reinforcement learning benchmark tasks, unlike deep reinforcement learning methods that can only find successful policies using much larger networks, suggesting that current benchmarks are easier to solve than previously assumed. Interestingly, Evolution Strategies also achieve results comparable to gradient-based deep reinforcement learning algorithms for higher-complexity tasks. Furthermore, we find that by directly accessing the memory state of the game, Evolution Strategies can find successful policies in Atari that outperform the policies found by Deep Q-Learning. Evolution Strategies also outperform Augmented Random Search in most benchmarks, demonstrating superior sample efficiency and robustness in training linear policy networks.</description>

      <title>World Model on Million-Length Video And Language With Blockwise RingAttention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current language models fall short in understanding aspects of the world not easily described in words, and struggle with complex, long-form tasks. Video sequences offer valuable temporal information absent in language and static images, making them attractive for joint modeling with language. Such models could develop a understanding of both human textual knowledge and the physical world, enabling broader AI capabilities for assisting humans. However, learning from millions of tokens of video and language sequences poses challenges due to memory constraints, computational complexity, and limited datasets. To address these challenges, we curate a large dataset of diverse videos and books, utilize the Blockwise RingAttention technique to scalably train on long sequences, and gradually increase context size from 4K to 1M tokens. This paper makes the following contributions: (a) Largest context size neural network: We train one of the largest context size transformers on long video and language sequences, setting new benchmarks in difficult retrieval tasks and long video understanding. (b) Solutions for overcoming vision-language training challenges, including using masked sequence packing for mixing different sequence lengths, loss weighting to balance language and vision, and model-generated QA dataset for long sequence chat. (c) A highly-optimized implementation with RingAttention, Blockwise Transformers, masked sequence packing, and other key features for training on millions-length multimodal sequences. (d) Fully open-sourced a family of 7B parameter models capable of processing long text documents (LWM-Text, LWM-Text-Chat) and videos (LWM, LWM-Chat) of over 1M tokens. This work paves the way for training on massive datasets of long video and language to develop understanding of both human knowledge and the multimodal world, and broader capabilities.</description>

      <title>SLADE: Detecting Dynamic Anomalies in Edge Streams without Labels via Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To detect anomalies in real-world graphs, such as social, email, and financial networks, various approaches have been developed. While they typically assume static input graphs, most real-world graphs grow over time, naturally represented as edge streams. In this context, we aim to achieve three goals: (a) instantly detecting anomalies as they occur, (b) adapting to dynamically changing states, and (c) handling the scarcity of dynamic anomaly labels. In this paper, we propose SLADE (Self-supervised Learning for Anomaly Detection in Edge Streams) for rapid detection of dynamic anomalies in edge streams, without relying on labels. SLADE detects the shifts of nodes into abnormal states by observing deviations in their interaction patterns over time. To this end, it trains a deep neural network to perform two self-supervised tasks: (a) minimizing drift in node representations and (b) generating long-term interaction patterns from short-term ones. Failure in these tasks for a node signals its deviation from the norm. Notably, the neural network and tasks are carefully designed so that all required operations can be performed in constant time (w.r.t. the graph size) in response to each new edge in the input stream. In dynamic anomaly detection across four real-world datasets, SLADE outperforms nine competing methods, even those leveraging label supervision.</description>

      <title>A Library of Mirrors: Deep Neural Nets in Low Dimensions are Convex Lasso Models with Reflection Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01046v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that training neural networks on 1-D data is equivalent to solving convex Lasso problems with discrete, explicitly defined dictionary matrices. We consider neural networks with piecewise linear activations and depths ranging from 2 to an arbitrary but finite number of layers. We first show that two-layer networks with piecewise linear activations are equivalent to Lasso models using a discrete dictionary of ramp functions, with breakpoints corresponding to the training data points. In certain general architectures with absolute value or ReLU activations, a third layer surprisingly creates features that reflect the training data about themselves. Additional layers progressively generate reflections of these reflections. The Lasso representation provides valuable insights into the analysis of globally optimal networks, elucidating their solution landscapes and enabling closed-form solutions in certain special cases. Numerical results show that reflections also occur when optimizing standard deep networks using standard non-convex optimizers. Additionally, we demonstrate our theory with autoregressive time series models.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Language Models: Machine Unlearning via Selective Pruning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and shaping the behaviour of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly important as applications become more powerful and more frequently adopted. This paper introduces a machine unlearning method specifically designed for LLMs. We introduce a selective pruning method for LLMs that removes neurons based on their relative importance on a targeted capability compared to overall network performance. This approach is a compute- and data-efficient method for identifying and removing neurons that enable specific behaviours. Our findings reveal that both feed-forward and attention neurons in LLMs are specialized; that is, for specific tasks, certain neurons are more crucial than others. Code from all experiments is available at https://github.com/nickypro/selective-pruning</description>

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized the machine learning landscape, gradually making their way into everyday tasks and equipping our computers with "sparks of intelligence". However, their runtime requirements have prevented them from being broadly deployed on mobile. As personal devices become increasingly powerful and prompt privacy becomes an ever more pressing issue, we explore the current state of mobile execution of Large Language Models (LLMs). To achieve this, we have created our own automation infrastructure, MELT, which supports the headless execution and benchmarking of LLMs on device, supporting different models, devices and frameworks, including Android, iOS and Nvidia Jetson devices. We evaluate popular instruction fine-tuned LLMs and leverage different frameworks to measure their end-to-end and granular performance, tracing their memory and energy requirements along the way. Our analysis is the first systematic study of on-device LLM execution, quantifying performance, energy efficiency and accuracy across various state-of-the-art models and showcases the state of on-device intelligence in the era of hyperscale models. Results highlight the performance heterogeneity across targets and corroborates that LLM inference is largely memory-bound. Quantization drastically reduces memory requirements and renders execution viable, but at a non-negligible accuracy cost. Drawing from its energy footprint and thermal behavior, the continuous execution of LLMs remains elusive, as both factors negatively affect user experience. Last, our experience shows that the ecosystem is still in its infancy, and algorithmic as well as hardware breakthroughs can significantly shift the execution cost. We expect NPU acceleration, and framework-hardware co-design to be the biggest bet towards efficient standalone execution, with the alternative of offloading tailored towards edge deployments.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Model Editing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ROME and MEMIT are largely believed to be two different model editing algorithms, with the major difference between them being the ability to perform batched edits. In this paper, we unify these two algorithms under a single conceptual umbrella, optimizing for the same goal, which we call the preservation-memorization objective. ROME uses an equality constraint to optimize this objective to perform one edit at a time, whereas MEMIT employs a more flexible least-square constraint that allows for batched edits. We generalize ROME and enable batched editing with equality constraint in the form of EMMET - an Equality-constrained Mass Model Editing algorithm for Transformers, a new batched memory-editing algorithm. EMMET can perform batched-edits up to a batch-size of 10,000, with very similar performance to MEMIT across multiple dimensions. With the introduction of EMMET, we truly unify ROME and MEMIT and show that both algorithms are equivalent in terms of their optimization objective, their abilities (singular and batched editing), their model editing performance and their limitations.</description>

      <title>The Elements of Differentiable Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has recently experienced remarkable advances, fueled by large models, vast datasets, accelerated hardware, and, last but not least, the transformative power of differentiable programming. This new programming paradigm enables end-to-end differentiation of complex computer programs (including those with control flows and data structures), making gradient-based optimization of program parameters possible. As an emerging paradigm, differentiable programming builds upon several areas of computer science and applied mathematics, including automatic differentiation, graphical models, optimization and statistics. This book presents a comprehensive review of the fundamental concepts useful for differentiable programming. We adopt two main perspectives, that of optimization and that of probability, with clear analogies between the two. Differentiable programming is not merely the differentiation of programs, but also the thoughtful design of programs intended for differentiation. By making programs differentiable, we inherently introduce probability distributions over their execution, providing a means to quantify the uncertainty associated with program outputs.</description>

      <title>MambaMixer: Efficient Selective State Space Models with Dual Token and Channel Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19888v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have mainly relied on Transformers due to their data dependency and ability to learn at scale. The attention module in these architectures, however, exhibits quadratic time and space in input size, limiting their scalability for long-sequence modeling. Despite recent attempts to design efficient and effective architecture backbone for multi-dimensional data, such as images and multivariate time series, existing models are either data independent, or fail to allow inter- and intra-dimension communication. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), and more specifically Selective State Space Models, with efficient hardware-aware implementation, have shown promising potential for long sequence modeling. Motivated by the success of SSMs, we present MambaMixer, a new architecture with data-dependent weights that uses a dual selection mechanism across tokens and channels, called Selective Token and Channel Mixer. MambaMixer connects selective mixers using a weighted averaging mechanism, allowing layers to have direct access to early features. As a proof of concept, we design Vision MambaMixer (ViM2) and Time Series MambaMixer (TSM2) architectures based on the MambaMixer block and explore their performance in various vision and time series forecasting tasks. Our results underline the importance of selective mixing across both tokens and channels. In ImageNet classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, ViM2 achieves competitive performance with well-established vision models and outperforms SSM-based vision models. In time series forecasting, TSM2 achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating significantly improved computational cost. These results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.</description>

Abstract: Higher-order interactions (HOIs) are ubiquitous in real-world complex systems and applications. Investigation of deep learning for HOIs, thus, has become a valuable agenda for the data mining and machine learning communities. As networks of HOIs are expressed mathematically as hypergraphs, hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for representation learning on hypergraphs. Given the emerging trend, we present the first survey dedicated to HNNs, with an in-depth and step-by-step guide. Broadly, the present survey overviews HNN architectures, training strategies, and applications. First, we break existing HNNs down into four design components: (i) input features, (ii) input structures, (iii) message-passing schemes, and (iv) training strategies. Second, we examine how HNNs address and learn HOIs with each of their components. Third, we overview the recent applications of HNNs in recommendation, bioinformatics and medical science, time series analysis, and computer vision. Lastly, we conclude with a discussion on limitations and future directions.</description>

      <title>Investigating Resource-efficient Neutron/Gamma Classification ML Models Targeting eFPGAs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been considerable interest and resulting progress in implementing machine learning (ML) models in hardware over the last several years from the particle and nuclear physics communities. A big driver has been the release of the Python package, hls4ml, which has enabled porting models specified and trained using Python ML libraries to register transfer level (RTL) code. So far, the primary end targets have been commercial FPGAs or synthesized custom blocks on ASICs. However, recent developments in open-source embedded FPGA (eFPGA) frameworks now provide an alternate, more flexible pathway for implementing ML models in hardware. These customized eFPGA fabrics can be integrated as part of an overall chip design. In general, the decision between a fully custom, eFPGA, or commercial FPGA ML implementation will depend on the details of the end-use application. In this work, we explored the parameter space for eFPGA implementations of fully-connected neural network (fcNN) and boosted decision tree (BDT) models using the task of neutron/gamma classification with a specific focus on resource efficiency. We used data collected using an AmBe sealed source incident on Stilbene, which was optically coupled to an OnSemi J-series SiPM to generate training and test data for this study. We investigated relevant input features and the effects of bit-resolution and sampling rate as well as trade-offs in hyperparameters for both ML architectures while tracking total resource usage. The performance metric used to track model performance was the calculated neutron efficiency at a gamma leakage of 10$^{-3}$. The results of the study will be used to aid the specification of an eFPGA fabric, which will be integrated as part of a test chip.</description>

      <title>An Experimental Study on the Rashomon Effect of Balancing Methods in Imbalanced Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01557v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictive models may generate biased predictions when classifying imbalanced datasets. This happens when the model favors the majority class, leading to low performance in accurately predicting the minority class. To address this issue, balancing or resampling methods are critical data-centric AI approaches in the modeling process to improve prediction performance. However, there have been debates and questions about the functionality of these methods in recent years. In particular, many candidate models may exhibit very similar predictive performance, called the Rashomon effect, in model selection, and they may even produce different predictions for the same observations. Selecting one of these models without considering the predictive multiplicity -- which is the case of yielding conflicting models' predictions for any sample -- can result in blind selection. In this paper, the impact of balancing methods on predictive multiplicity is examined using the Rashomon effect. It is crucial because the blind model selection in data-centric AI is risky from a set of approximately equally accurate models. This may lead to severe problems in model selection, validation, and explanation. To tackle this matter, we conducted real dataset experiments to observe the impact of balancing methods on predictive multiplicity through the Rashomon effect by using a newly proposed metric obscurity in addition to the existing ones: ambiguity and discrepancy. Our findings showed that balancing methods inflate the predictive multiplicity and yield varying results. To monitor the trade-off between the prediction performance and predictive multiplicity for conducting the modeling process responsibly, we proposed using the extended version of the performance-gain plot when balancing the training data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07987v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that representations in AI models, particularly deep networks, are converging. First, we survey many examples of convergence in the literature: over time and across multiple domains, the ways by which different neural networks represent data are becoming more aligned. Next, we demonstrate convergence across data modalities: as vision models and language models get larger, they measure distance between datapoints in a more and more alike way. We hypothesize that this convergence is driving toward a shared statistical model of reality, akin to Plato's concept of an ideal reality. We term such a representation the platonic representation and discuss several possible selective pressures toward it. Finally, we discuss the implications of these trends, their limitations, and counterexamples to our analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The point cloud is a flexible representation for a wide variety of data types, and is a particularly natural fit for the 3D conformations of molecules. Extant molecule embedding/representation schemes typically focus on internal degrees of freedom, ignoring the global 3D orientation. For tasks that depend on knowledge of both molecular conformation and 3D orientation, such as the generation of molecular dimers, clusters, or condensed phases, we require a representation which is provably complete in the types and positions of atomic nuclei and roto-inversion equivariant with respect to the input point cloud. We develop, train, and evaluate a new type of autoencoder, molecular O(3) encoding net (Mo3ENet), for multi-type point clouds, for which we propose a new reconstruction loss, capitalizing on a Gaussian mixture representation of the input and output point clouds. Mo3ENet is end-to-end equivariant, meaning the learned representation can be manipulated on O(3), a practical bonus for downstream learning tasks. An appropriately trained Mo3ENet latent space comprises a universal embedding for scalar and vector molecule property prediction tasks, as well as other downstream tasks incorporating the 3D molecular pose.</description>

      <title>Quantum Implicit Neural Representations</title>

Abstract: Implicit neural representations have emerged as a powerful paradigm to represent signals such as images and sounds. This approach aims to utilize neural networks to parameterize the implicit function of the signal. However, when representing implicit functions, traditional neural networks such as ReLU-based multilayer perceptrons face challenges in accurately modeling high-frequency components of signals. Recent research has begun to explore the use of Fourier Neural Networks (FNNs) to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we propose Quantum Implicit Representation Network (QIREN), a novel quantum generalization of FNNs. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that QIREN possesses a quantum advantage over classical FNNs. Lastly, we conducted experiments in signal representation, image superresolution, and image generation tasks to show the superior performance of QIREN compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Our work not only incorporates quantum advantages into implicit neural representations but also uncovers a promising application direction for Quantum Neural Networks.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery over High-Dimensional Structured Hypothesis Spaces with Causal Graph Partitioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim in many sciences is to understand the mechanisms that underlie the observed distribution of variables, starting from a set of initial hypotheses. Causal discovery allows us to infer mechanisms as sets of cause and effect relationships in a generalized way -- without necessarily tailoring to a specific domain. Causal discovery algorithms search over a structured hypothesis space, defined by the set of directed acyclic graphs, to find the graph that best explains the data. For high-dimensional problems, however, this search becomes intractable and scalable algorithms for causal discovery are needed to bridge the gap. In this paper, we define a novel causal graph partition that allows for divide-and-conquer causal discovery with theoretical guarantees. We leverage the idea of a superstructure -- a set of learned or existing candidate hypotheses -- to partition the search space. We prove under certain assumptions that learning with a causal graph partition always yields the Markov Equivalence Class of the true causal graph. We show our algorithm achieves comparable accuracy and a faster time to solution for biologically-tuned synthetic networks and networks up to ${10^4}$ variables. This makes our method applicable to gene regulatory network inference and other domains with high-dimensional structured hypothesis spaces.</description>

      <title>Probing the Decision Boundaries of In-context Learning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-context learning is a key paradigm in large language models (LLMs) that enables them to generalize to new tasks and domains by simply prompting these models with a few exemplars without explicit parameter updates. Many attempts have been made to understand in-context learning in LLMs as a function of model scale, pretraining data, and other factors. In this work, we propose a new mechanism to probe and understand in-context learning from the lens of decision boundaries for in-context binary classification. Decision boundaries are straightforward to visualize and provide important information about the qualitative behavior of the inductive biases of standard classifiers. To our surprise, we find that the decision boundaries learned by current LLMs in simple binary classification tasks are often irregular and non-smooth, regardless of linear separability in the underlying task. This paper investigates the factors influencing these decision boundaries and explores methods to enhance their generalizability. We assess various approaches, including training-free and fine-tuning methods for LLMs, the impact of model architecture, and the effectiveness of active prompting techniques for smoothing decision boundaries in a data-efficient manner. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of in-context learning dynamics and offer practical improvements for enhancing robustness and generalizability of in-context learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Active Learning (AL) techniques can be effective in reducing annotation costs for training deep models. However, their effectiveness in low- and high-budget scenarios seems to require different strategies, and achieving optimal results across varying budget scenarios remains a challenge. In this study, we introduce Dynamic Coverage &amp; Margin mix (DCoM), a novel active learning approach designed to bridge this gap. Unlike existing strategies, DCoM dynamically adjusts its strategy, considering the competence of the current model. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on diverse datasets, including challenging computer vision tasks, we demonstrate DCoM's ability to overcome the cold start problem and consistently improve results across different budgetary constraints. Thus DCoM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both low- and high-budget regimes.</description>

      <title>FreeCG: Free the Design Space of Clebsch-Gordan Transform for Machine Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Clebsch-Gordan Transform (CG transform) effectively encodes many-body interactions. Many studies have proven its accuracy in depicting atomic environments, although this comes with high computational needs. The computational burden of this challenge is hard to reduce due to the need for permutation equivariance, which limits the design space of the CG transform layer. We show that, implementing the CG transform layer on permutation-invariant inputs allows complete freedom in the design of this layer without affecting symmetry. Developing further on this premise, our idea is to create a CG transform layer that operates on permutation-invariant abstract edges generated from real edge information. We bring in group CG transform with sparse path, abstract edges shuffling, and attention enhancer to form a powerful and efficient CG transform layer. Our method, known as FreeCG, achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) results in force prediction for MD17, rMD17, MD22, and property prediction in QM9 datasets with notable enhancement. The extensibility to other models is also examined. Molecular dynamics simulations are carried out on MD17 and other periodic systems, including water and LiPS, showcasing the capacity for real-world applications of FreeCG. It introduces a novel paradigm for carrying out efficient and expressive CG transform in future geometric neural network designs.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Guided Response for Security Operation Centers with Microsoft Copilot for Security</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Security operation centers contend with a constant stream of security incidents, ranging from straightforward to highly complex. To address this, we developed Copilot Guided Response (CGR), an industry-scale ML architecture that guides security analysts across three key tasks -- (1) investigation, providing essential historical context by identifying similar incidents; (2) triaging to ascertain the nature of the incident -- whether it is a true positive, false positive, or benign positive; and (3) remediation, recommending tailored containment actions. CGR is integrated into the Microsoft Defender XDR product and deployed worldwide, generating millions of recommendations across thousands of customers. Our extensive evaluation, incorporating internal evaluation, collaboration with security experts, and customer feedback, demonstrates that CGR delivers high-quality recommendations across all three tasks. We provide a comprehensive overview of the CGR architecture, setting a precedent as the first cybersecurity company to openly discuss these capabilities in such depth. Additionally, we GUIDE, the largest public collection of real-world security incidents, spanning 13M evidences across 1M annotated incidents. By enabling researchers and practitioners to conduct research on real-world data, GUIDE advances the state of cybersecurity and supports the development of next-generation machine learning systems.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Benefits of Self-Modeling in Neural Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-models have been a topic of great interest for decades in studies of human cognition and more recently in machine learning. Yet what benefits do self-models confer? Here we show that when artificial networks learn to predict their internal states as an auxiliary task, they change in a fundamental way. To better perform the self-model task, the network learns to make itself simpler, more regularized, more parameter-efficient, and therefore more amenable to being predictively modeled. To test the hypothesis of self-regularizing through self-modeling, we used a range of network architectures performing three classification tasks across two modalities. In all cases, adding self-modeling caused a significant reduction in network complexity. The reduction was observed in two ways. First, the distribution of weights was narrower when self-modeling was present. Second, a measure of network complexity, the real log canonical threshold (RLCT), was smaller when self-modeling was present. Not only were measures of complexity reduced, but the reduction became more pronounced as greater training weight was placed on the auxiliary task of self-modeling. These results strongly support the hypothesis that self-modeling is more than simply a network learning to predict itself. The learning has a restructuring effect, reducing complexity and increasing parameter efficiency. This self-regularization may help explain some of the benefits of self-models reported in recent machine learning literature, as well as the adaptive value of self-models to biological systems. In particular, these findings may shed light on the possible interaction between the ability to model oneself and the ability to be more easily modeled by others in a social or cooperative context.</description>

      <title>MetaLLM: A High-performant and Cost-efficient Dynamic Framework for Wrapping LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid progress in machine learning (ML) has brought forth many large language models (LLMs) that excel in various tasks and areas. These LLMs come with different abilities and costs in terms of computation or pricing. Since the demand for each query can vary, e.g., because of the queried domain or its complexity, defaulting to one LLM in an application is not usually the best choice, whether it is the biggest, priciest, or even the one with the best average test performance. Consequently, picking the right LLM that is both accurate and cost-effective for an application remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce MetaLLM, a framework that dynamically and intelligently routes each query to the optimal LLM (among several available LLMs) for classification tasks, achieving significantly improved accuracy and cost-effectiveness. By framing the selection problem as a multi-armed bandit, MetaLLM balances prediction accuracy and cost efficiency under uncertainty. Our experiments, conducted on popular LLM platforms such as OpenAI's GPT models, Amazon's Titan, Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's LLaMa, showcase MetaLLM's efficacy in real-world scenarios, laying the groundwork for future extensions beyond classification tasks.</description>

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved exceptional performance across various fields by learning complex nonlinear mappings from large-scale datasets. However, they encounter challenges such as high computational costs and limited interpretability. To address these issues, hybrid approaches that integrate physics with AI are gaining interest. This paper introduces a novel physics-based AI model called the "Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network", which treats the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NLSE) as a general-purpose trainable model for learning complex patterns including nonlinear mappings and memory effects from data. Existing physics-informed machine learning methods use neural networks to approximate the solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs). In contrast, our approach directly treats the PDE as a trainable model to obtain general nonlinear mappings that would otherwise require neural networks. As a type of physics-AI symbiosis, it offers a more interpretable and parameter-efficient alternative to traditional black-box neural networks, achieving comparable or better accuracy in some time series classification tasks while significantly reducing the number of required parameters. Notably, the trained Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network is interpretable, with all parameters having physical meanings as properties of a virtual physical system that transforms the data to a more separable space. This interpretability allows for insight into the underlying dynamics of the data transformation process. Applications to time series forecasting have also been explored. While our current implementation utilizes the NLSE, the proposed method of using physics equations as trainable models to learn nonlinear mappings from data is not limited to the NLSE and may be extended to other master equations of physics.</description>

      <title>Universally Harmonizing Differential Privacy Mechanisms for Federated Learning: Boosting Accuracy and Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) is a promising technique for collaborative model training while ensuring provable privacy for clients. However, optimizing the tradeoff between privacy and accuracy remains a critical challenge. To our best knowledge, we propose the first DP-FL framework (namely UDP-FL), which universally harmonizes any randomization mechanism (e.g., an optimal one) with the Gaussian Moments Accountant (viz. DP-SGD) to significantly boost accuracy and convergence. Specifically, UDP-FL demonstrates enhanced model performance by mitigating the reliance on Gaussian noise. The key mediator variable in this transformation is the R\'enyi Differential Privacy notion, which is carefully used to harmonize privacy budgets. We also propose an innovative method to theoretically analyze the convergence for DP-FL (including our UDP-FL ) based on mode connectivity analysis. Moreover, we evaluate our UDP-FL through extensive experiments benchmarked against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, demonstrating superior performance on both privacy guarantees and model performance. Notably, UDP-FL exhibits substantial resilience against different inference attacks, indicating a significant advance in safeguarding sensitive data in federated learning environments.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Temporal Cross-View Contrastive Pre-training for Check-in Sequence Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of location-based services (LBS) has yielded massive amounts of data on human mobility. Effectively extracting meaningful representations for user-generated check-in sequences is pivotal for facilitating various downstream services. However, the user-generated check-in data are simultaneously influenced by the surrounding objective circumstances and the user's subjective intention. Specifically, the temporal uncertainty and spatial diversity exhibited in check-in data make it difficult to capture the macroscopic spatial-temporal patterns of users and to understand the semantics of user mobility activities. Furthermore, the distinct characteristics of the temporal and spatial information in check-in sequences call for an effective fusion method to incorporate these two types of information. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Cross-view Contrastive Representation (STCCR) framework for check-in sequence representation learning. Specifically, STCCR addresses the above challenges by employing self-supervision from "spatial topic" and "temporal intention" views, facilitating effective fusion of spatial and temporal information at the semantic level. Besides, STCCR leverages contrastive clustering to uncover users' shared spatial topics from diverse mobility activities, while employing angular momentum contrast to mitigate the impact of temporal uncertainty and noise. We extensively evaluate STCCR on three real-world datasets and demonstrate its superior performance across three downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Logistic regression models for patient-level prediction based on massive observational data: Do we need all data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.07361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: Provide guidance on sample size considerations for developing predictive models by empirically establishing the adequate sample size, which balances the competing objectives of improving model performance and reducing model complexity as well as computational requirements.
  Materials and Methods: We empirically assess the effect of sample size on prediction performance and model complexity by generating learning curves for 81 prediction problems (23 outcomes predicted in a depression cohort, 58 outcomes predicted in a hypertension cohort) in three large observational health databases, requiring training of 17,248 prediction models. The adequate sample size was defined as the sample size for which the performance of a model equalled the maximum model performance minus a small threshold value.
  Results: The adequate sample size achieves a median reduction of the number of observations of 9.5%, 37.3%, 58.5%, and 78.5% for the thresholds of 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02, respectively. The median reduction of the number of predictors in the models was 8.6%, 32.2%, 48.2%, and 68.3% for the thresholds of 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02, respectively.
  Discussion: Based on our results a conservative, yet significant, reduction in sample size and model complexity can be estimated for future prediction work. Though, if a researcher is willing to generate a learning curve a much larger reduction of the model complexity may be possible as suggested by a large outcome-dependent variability.
  Conclusion: Our results suggest that in most cases only a fraction of the available data was sufficient to produce a model close to the performance of one developed on the full data set, but with a substantially reduced model complexity.</description>

Abstract: We consider the bandit-based framework for diversity-preserving recommendations introduced by Celis et al. (2019), who approached it in the case of a polytope mainly by a reduction to the setting of linear bandits. We design a UCB algorithm using the specific structure of the setting and show that it enjoys a bounded distribution-dependent regret in the natural cases when the optimal mixed actions put some probability mass on all actions (i.e., when diversity is desirable). The regret lower bounds provided show that otherwise, at least when the model is mean-unbounded, a $\ln T$ regret is suffered. We also discuss an example beyond the special case of polytopes.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Trajectory Tracking under Learned Dynamics with Contraction Metrics and Disturbance Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.08222v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to trajectory-centric learning control based on contraction metrics and disturbance estimation for nonlinear systems subject to matched uncertainties. The approach uses deep neural networks to learn uncertain dynamics while still providing guarantees of transient tracking performance throughout the learning phase. Within the proposed approach, a disturbance estimation law is adopted to estimate the pointwise value of the uncertainty, with pre-computable estimation error bounds (EEBs). The learned dynamics, the estimated disturbances, and the EEBs are then incorporated in a robust Riemann energy condition to compute the control law that guarantees exponential convergence of actual trajectories to desired ones throughout the learning phase, even when the learned model is poor. On the other hand, with improved accuracy, the learned model can help improve the robustness of the tracking controller, e.g., against input delays, and can be incorporated to plan better trajectories with improved performance, e.g., lower energy consumption and shorter travel time.The proposed framework is validated on a planar quadrotor example.</description>

      <title>Improved Random Features for Dot Product Kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.08712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dot product kernels, such as polynomial and exponential (softmax) kernels, are among the most widely used kernels in machine learning, as they enable modeling the interactions between input features, which is crucial in applications like computer vision, natural language processing, and recommender systems. We make several novel contributions for improving the efficiency of random feature approximations for dot product kernels, to make these kernels more useful in large scale learning. First, we present a generalization of existing random feature approximations for polynomial kernels, such as Rademacher and Gaussian sketches and TensorSRHT, using complex-valued random features. We show empirically that the use of complex features can significantly reduce the variances of these approximations. Second, we provide a theoretical analysis for understanding the factors affecting the efficiency of various random feature approximations, by deriving closed-form expressions for their variances. These variance formulas elucidate conditions under which certain approximations (e.g., TensorSRHT) achieve lower variances than others (e.g., Rademacher sketches), and conditions under which the use of complex features leads to lower variances than real features. Third, by using these variance formulas, which can be evaluated in practice, we develop a data-driven optimization approach to improve random feature approximations for general dot product kernels, which is also applicable to the Gaussian kernel. We describe the improvements brought by these contributions with extensive experiments on a variety of tasks and datasets.</description>

Abstract: Tensor networks, widely used for providing efficient representations of low-energy states of local quantum many-body systems, have been recently proposed as machine learning architectures which could present advantages with respect to traditional ones. In this work we show that tensor network architectures have especially prospective properties for privacy-preserving machine learning, which is important in tasks such as the processing of medical records. First, we describe a new privacy vulnerability that is present in feedforward neural networks, illustrating it in synthetic and real-world datasets. Then, we develop well-defined conditions to guarantee robustness to such vulnerability, which involve the characterization of models equivalent under gauge symmetry. We rigorously prove that such conditions are satisfied by tensor-network architectures. In doing so, we define a novel canonical form for matrix product states, which has a high degree of regularity and fixes the residual gauge that is left in the canonical forms based on singular value decompositions. We supplement the analytical findings with practical examples where matrix product states are trained on datasets of medical records, which show large reductions on the probability of an attacker extracting information about the training dataset from the model's parameters. Given the growing expertise in training tensor-network architectures, these results imply that one may not have to be forced to make a choice between accuracy in prediction and ensuring the privacy of the information processed.</description>

      <title>$\Phi$-DVAE: Physics-Informed Dynamical Variational Autoencoders for Unstructured Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating unstructured data into physical models is a challenging problem that is emerging in data assimilation. Traditional approaches focus on well-defined observation operators whose functional forms are typically assumed to be known. This prevents these methods from achieving a consistent model-data synthesis in configurations where the mapping from data-space to model-space is unknown. To address these shortcomings, in this paper we develop a physics-informed dynamical variational autoencoder ($\Phi$-DVAE) to embed diverse data streams into time-evolving physical systems described by differential equations. Our approach combines a standard, possibly nonlinear, filter for the latent state-space model and a VAE, to assimilate the unstructured data into the latent dynamical system. Unstructured data, in our example systems, comes in the form of video data and velocity field measurements, however the methodology is suitably generic to allow for arbitrary unknown observation operators. A variational Bayesian framework is used for the joint estimation of the encoding, latent states, and unknown system parameters. To demonstrate the method, we provide case studies with the Lorenz-63 ordinary differential equation, and the advection and Korteweg-de Vries partial differential equations. Our results, with synthetic data, show that $\Phi$-DVAE provides a data efficient dynamics encoding methodology which is competitive with standard approaches. Unknown parameters are recovered with uncertainty quantification, and unseen data are accurately predicted.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Information Field Theory for Modeling Physical Systems with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07609v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven approaches coupled with physical knowledge are powerful techniques to model systems. The goal of such models is to efficiently solve for the underlying field by combining measurements with known physical laws. As many systems contain unknown elements, such as missing parameters, noisy data, or incomplete physical laws, this is widely approached as an uncertainty quantification problem. The common techniques to handle all the variables typically depend on the numerical scheme used to approximate the posterior, and it is desirable to have a method which is independent of any such discretization. Information field theory (IFT) provides the tools necessary to perform statistics over fields that are not necessarily Gaussian. We extend IFT to physics-informed IFT (PIFT) by encoding the functional priors with information about the physical laws which describe the field. The posteriors derived from this PIFT remain independent of any numerical scheme and can capture multiple modes, allowing for the solution of problems which are ill-posed. We demonstrate our approach through an analytical example involving the Klein-Gordon equation. We then develop a variant of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to draw samples from the joint posterior over the field and model parameters. We apply our method to numerical examples with various degrees of model-form error and to inverse problems involving nonlinear differential equations. As an addendum, the method is equipped with a metric which allows the posterior to automatically quantify model-form uncertainty. Because of this, our numerical experiments show that the method remains robust to even an incorrect representation of the physics given sufficient data. We numerically demonstrate that the method correctly identifies when the physics cannot be trusted, in which case it automatically treats learning the field as a regression problem.</description>

      <title>Description-Based Text Similarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12517v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying texts with a given semantics is central for many information seeking scenarios. Similarity search over vector embeddings appear to be central to this ability, yet the similarity reflected in current text embeddings is corpus-driven, and is inconsistent and sub-optimal for many use cases. What, then, is a good notion of similarity for effective retrieval of text?
  We identify the need to search for texts based on abstract descriptions of their content, and the corresponding notion of \emph{description based similarity}. We demonstrate the inadequacy of current text embeddings and propose an alternative model that significantly improves when used in standard nearest neighbor search. The model is trained using positive and negative pairs sourced through prompting a LLM, demonstrating how data from LLMs can be used for creating new capabilities not immediately possible using the original model.</description>

      <title>Variation Spaces for Multi-Output Neural Networks: Insights on Multi-Task Learning and Network Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework for the analysis of vector-valued neural networks through the development of vector-valued variation spaces, a new class of reproducing kernel Banach spaces. These spaces emerge from studying the regularization effect of weight decay in training networks with activations like the rectified linear unit (ReLU). This framework offers a deeper understanding of multi-output networks and their function-space characteristics. A key contribution of this work is the development of a representer theorem for the vector-valued variation spaces. This representer theorem establishes that shallow vector-valued neural networks are the solutions to data-fitting problems over these infinite-dimensional spaces, where the network widths are bounded by the square of the number of training data. This observation reveals that the norm associated with these vector-valued variation spaces encourages the learning of features that are useful for multiple tasks, shedding new light on multi-task learning with neural networks. Finally, this paper develops a connection between weight-decay regularization and the multi-task lasso problem. This connection leads to novel bounds for layer widths in deep networks that depend on the intrinsic dimensions of the training data representations. This insight not only deepens the understanding of the deep network architectural requirements, but also yields a simple convex optimization method for deep neural network compression. The performance of this compression procedure is evaluated on various architectures.</description>

      <title>When Does Bottom-up Beat Top-down in Hierarchical Community Detection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical clustering of networks consists in finding a tree of communities, such that lower levels of the hierarchy reveal finer-grained community structures. There are two main classes of algorithms tackling this problem. Divisive ($\textit{top-down}$) algorithms recursively partition the nodes into two communities, until a stopping rule indicates that no further split is needed. In contrast, agglomerative ($\textit{bottom-up}$) algorithms first identify the smallest community structure and then repeatedly merge the communities using a $\textit{linkage}$ method. In this article, we establish theoretical guarantees for the recovery of the hierarchical tree and community structure of a Hierarchical Stochastic Block Model by a bottom-up algorithm. We also establish that this bottom-up algorithm attains the information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery at intermediate levels of the hierarchy. Notably, these recovery conditions are less restrictive compared to those existing for top-down algorithms. This shows that bottom-up algorithms extend the feasible region for achieving exact recovery at intermediate levels. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data sets confirm the superiority of bottom-up algorithms over top-down algorithms. We also observe that top-down algorithms can produce dendrograms with inversions. These findings contribute to a better understanding of hierarchical clustering techniques and their applications in network analysis.</description>

      <title>MovePose: A High-performance Human Pose Estimation Algorithm on Mobile and Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09084v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MovePose, an optimized lightweight convolutional neural network designed specifically for real-time body pose estimation on CPU-based mobile devices. The current solutions do not provide satisfactory accuracy and speed for human posture estimation, and MovePose addresses this gap. It aims to maintain real-time performance while improving the accuracy of human posture estimation for mobile devices. Our MovePose algorithm has attained an Mean Average Precision (mAP) score of 68.0 on the COCO \cite{cocodata} validation dataset. The MovePose algorithm displayed efficiency with a performance of 69+ frames per second (fps) when run on an Intel i9-10920x CPU. Additionally, it showcased an increased performance of 452+ fps on an NVIDIA RTX3090 GPU. On an Android phone equipped with a Snapdragon 8 + 4G processor, the fps reached above 11. To enhance accuracy, we incorporated three techniques: deconvolution, large kernel convolution, and coordinate classification methods. Compared to basic upsampling, deconvolution is trainable, improves model capacity, and enhances the receptive field. Large kernel convolution strengthens these properties at a decreased computational cost. In summary, MovePose provides high accuracy and real-time performance, marking it a potential tool for a variety of applications, including those focused on mobile-side human posture estimation. The code and models for this algorithm will be made publicly accessible.</description>

      <title>Learning a Patent-Informed Biomedical Knowledge Graph Reveals Technological Potential of Drug Repositioning Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drug repositioning-a promising strategy for discovering new therapeutic uses for existing drugs-has been increasingly explored in the computational science literature using biomedical databases. However, the technological potential of drug repositioning candidates has often been overlooked. This study presents a novel protocol to comprehensively analyse various sources such as pharmaceutical patents and biomedical databases, and identify drug repositioning candidates with both technological potential and scientific evidence. To this end, first, we constructed a scientific biomedical knowledge graph (s-BKG) comprising relationships between drugs, diseases, and genes derived from biomedical databases. Our protocol involves identifying drugs that exhibit limited association with the target disease but are closely located in the s-BKG, as potential drug candidates. We constructed a patent-informed biomedical knowledge graph (p-BKG) by adding pharmaceutical patent information. Finally, we developed a graph embedding protocol to ascertain the structure of the p-BKG, thereby calculating the relevance scores of those candidates with target disease-related patents to evaluate their technological potential. Our case study on Alzheimer's disease demonstrates its efficacy and feasibility, while the quantitative outcomes and systematic methods are expected to bridge the gap between computational discoveries and successful market applications in drug repositioning research.</description>

      <title>High-Probability Convergence for Composite and Distributed Stochastic Minimization and Variational Inequalities with Heavy-Tailed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-probability analysis of stochastic first-order optimization methods under mild assumptions on the noise has been gaining a lot of attention in recent years. Typically, gradient clipping is one of the key algorithmic ingredients to derive good high-probability guarantees when the noise is heavy-tailed. However, if implemented na\"ively, clipping can spoil the convergence of the popular methods for composite and distributed optimization (Prox-SGD/Parallel SGD) even in the absence of any noise. Due to this reason, many works on high-probability analysis consider only unconstrained non-distributed problems, and the existing results for composite/distributed problems do not include some important special cases (like strongly convex problems) and are not optimal. To address this issue, we propose new stochastic methods for composite and distributed optimization based on the clipping of stochastic gradient differences and prove tight high-probability convergence results (including nearly optimal ones) for the new methods. Using similar ideas, we also develop new methods for composite and distributed variational inequalities and analyze the high-probability convergence of these methods.</description>

      <title>Tree-Planner: Efficient Close-loop Task Planning with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies close-loop task planning, which refers to the process of generating a sequence of skills (a plan) to accomplish a specific goal while adapting the plan based on real-time observations. Recently, prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate actions iteratively has become a prevalent paradigm due to its superior performance and user-friendliness. However, this paradigm is plagued by two inefficiencies: high token consumption and redundant error correction, both of which hinder its scalability for large-scale testing and applications. To address these issues, we propose Tree-Planner, which reframes task planning with LLMs into three distinct phases: plan sampling, action tree construction, and grounded deciding. Tree-Planner starts by using an LLM to sample a set of potential plans before execution, followed by the aggregation of them to form an action tree. Finally, the LLM performs a top-down decision-making process on the tree, taking into account real-time environmental information. Experiments show that Tree-Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high efficiency. By decomposing LLM queries into a single plan-sampling call and multiple grounded-deciding calls, a considerable part of the prompt are less likely to be repeatedly consumed. As a result, token consumption is reduced by 92.2% compared to the previously best-performing model. Additionally, by enabling backtracking on the action tree as needed, the correction process becomes more flexible, leading to a 40.5% decrease in error corrections.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Topological Structure Enhancers for Text-Attributed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP). Inspired by the success of LLMs in NLP tasks, some recent work has begun investigating the potential of applying LLMs in graph learning tasks. However, most of the existing work focuses on utilizing LLMs as powerful node feature augmenters, leaving employing LLMs to enhance graph topological structures an understudied problem. In this work, we explore how to leverage the information retrieval and text generation capabilities of LLMs to refine/enhance the topological structure of text-attributed graphs (TAGs) under the node classification setting. First, we propose using LLMs to help remove unreliable edges and add reliable ones in the TAG. Specifically, we first let the LLM output the semantic similarity between node attributes through delicate prompt designs, and then perform edge deletion and edge addition based on the similarity. Second, we propose using pseudo-labels generated by the LLM to improve graph topology, that is, we introduce the pseudo-label propagation as a regularization to guide the graph neural network (GNN) in learning proper edge weights. Finally, we incorporate the two aforementioned LLM-based methods for graph topological refinement into the process of GNN training, and perform extensive experiments on four real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-based graph topology refinement (achieving a 0.15%--2.47% performance gain on public benchmarks).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphs are structured data that models complex relations between real-world entities. Heterophilous graphs, where linked nodes are prone to be with different labels or dissimilar features, have recently attracted significant attention and found many applications. Meanwhile, increasing efforts have been made to advance learning from heterophilous graphs. Although there exist surveys on the relevant topic, they focus on heterophilous GNNs, which are only sub-topics of heterophilous graph learning. In this survey, we comprehensively overview existing works on learning from graphs with heterophily.First, we collect over 180 publications and introduce the development of this field. Then, we systematically categorize existing methods based on a hierarchical taxonomy including learning strategies, model architectures and practical applications. Finally, we discuss the primary challenges of existing studies and highlight promising avenues for future research.More publication details and corresponding open-source codes can be accessed and will be continuously updated at our repositories:https://github.com/gongchenghua/Papers-Graphs-with-Heterophily.</description>

Abstract: Generative AI has witnessed rapid advancement in recent years, expanding their capabilities to create synthesized content such as text, images, audio, and code. The high fidelity and authenticity of contents generated by these Deep Generative Models (DGMs) have sparked significant copyright concerns. There have been various legal debates on how to effectively safeguard copyrights in DGMs. This work delves into this issue by providing a comprehensive overview of copyright protection from a technical perspective. We examine from two distinct viewpoints: the copyrights pertaining to the source data held by the data owners and those of the generative models maintained by the model builders. For data copyright, we delve into methods data owners can protect their content and DGMs can be utilized without infringing upon these rights. For model copyright, our discussion extends to strategies for preventing model theft and identifying outputs generated by specific models. Finally, we highlight the limitations of existing techniques and identify areas that remain unexplored. Furthermore, we discuss prospective directions for the future of copyright protection, underscoring its importance for the sustainable and ethical development of Generative AI.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool to improve the accuracy and performance of recommender systems. Modern recommender systems are not only designed to serve end users, but also to benefit other participants, such as items and items providers. These participants may have different or conflicting goals and interests, which raise the need for fairness and popularity bias considerations. GNN-based recommendation methods also face the challenges of unfairness and popularity bias and their normalization and aggregation processes suffer from these challenges. In this paper, we propose a fair GNN-based recommender system, called HetroFair, to improve items' side fairness. HetroFair uses two separate components to generate fairness-aware embeddings: i) fairnessaware attention which incorporates dot product in the normalization process of GNNs, to decrease the effect of nodes' degrees, and ii) heterophily feature weighting to assign distinct weights to different features during the aggregation process. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of HetroFair, we conduct extensive experiments over six real-world datasets. Our experimental results reveal that HetroFair not only alleviates the unfairness and popularity bias on items' side, but also achieves superior accuracy on users' side. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/NematGH/HetroFair.</description>

      <title>Efficient Unbiased Sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An unbiased $m$-sparsification of a vector $p\in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a random vector $Q\in \mathbb{R}^n$ with mean $p$ that has at most $m&lt;n$ nonzero coordinates. Unbiased sparsification compresses the original vector without introducing bias; it arises in various contexts, such as in federated learning and sampling sparse probability distributions. Ideally, unbiased sparsification should also minimize the expected value of a divergence function $\mathsf{Div}(Q,p)$ that measures how far away $Q$ is from the original $p$. If $Q$ is optimal in this sense, then we call it efficient. Our main results describe efficient unbiased sparsifications for divergences that are either permutation-invariant or additively separable. Surprisingly, the characterization for permutation-invariant divergences is robust to the choice of divergence function, in the sense that our class of optimal $Q$ for squared Euclidean distance coincides with our class of optimal $Q$ for Kullback-Leibler divergence, or indeed any of a wide variety of divergences.</description>

      <title>Supervised machine learning for microbiomics: bridging the gap between current and best practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is set to accelerate innovations in clinical microbiomics, such as in disease diagnostics and prognostics. This will require high-quality, reproducible, interpretable workflows whose predictive capabilities meet or exceed the high thresholds set for clinical tools by regulatory agencies. Here, we capture a snapshot of current practices in the application of supervised ML to microbiomics data, through an in-depth analysis of 100 peer-reviewed journal articles published in 2021-2022. We apply a data-driven approach to steer discussion of the merits of varied approaches to experimental design, including key considerations such as how to mitigate the effects of small dataset size while avoiding data leakage. We further provide guidance on how to avoid common experimental design pitfalls that can hurt model performance, trustworthiness, and reproducibility. Discussion is accompanied by an interactive online tutorial that demonstrates foundational principles of ML experimental design, tailored to the microbiomics community. Formalizing community best practices for supervised ML in microbiomics is an important step towards improving the success and efficiency of clinical research, to the benefit of patients and other stakeholders.</description>

      <title>RigorLLM: Resilient Guardrails for Large Language Models against Undesired Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities across various tasks in different domains. However, the emergence of biases and the potential for generating harmful content in LLMs, particularly under malicious inputs, pose significant challenges. Current mitigation strategies, while effective, are not resilient under adversarial attacks. This paper introduces Resilient Guardrails for Large Language Models (RigorLLM), a novel framework designed to efficiently and effectively moderate harmful and unsafe inputs and outputs for LLMs. By employing a multi-faceted approach that includes energy-based training data augmentation through Langevin dynamics, optimizing a safe suffix for inputs via minimax optimization, and integrating a fusion-based model combining robust KNN with LLMs based on our data augmentation, RigorLLM offers a robust solution to harmful content moderation. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that RigorLLM not only outperforms existing baselines like OpenAI API and Perspective API in detecting harmful content but also exhibits unparalleled resilience to jailbreaking attacks. The innovative use of constrained optimization and a fusion-based guardrail approach represents a significant step forward in developing more secure and reliable LLMs, setting a new standard for content moderation frameworks in the face of evolving digital threats.</description>

      <title>On the Federated Learning Framework for Cooperative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17147v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperative perception is essential to enhance the efficiency and safety of future transportation systems, requiring extensive data sharing among vehicles on the road, which raises significant privacy concerns. Federated learning offers a promising solution by enabling data privacy-preserving collaborative enhancements in perception, decision-making, and planning among connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). However, federated learning is impeded by significant challenges arising from data heterogeneity across diverse clients, potentially diminishing model accuracy and prolonging convergence periods. This study introduces a specialized federated learning framework for CP, termed the federated dynamic weighted aggregation (FedDWA) algorithm, facilitated by dynamic adjusting loss (DALoss) function. This framework employs dynamic client weighting to direct model convergence and integrates a novel loss function that utilizes Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) to counteract the detrimental effects of non-independently and identically distributed (Non-IID) and unbalanced data. Utilizing the BEV transformer as the primary model, our rigorous testing on the OpenV2V dataset, augmented with FedBEVT data, demonstrates significant improvements in the average intersection over union (IoU). These results highlight the substantial potential of our federated learning framework to address data heterogeneity challenges in CP, thereby enhancing the accuracy of environmental perception models and facilitating more robust and efficient collaborative learning solutions in the transportation sector.</description>

      <title>QUACK: Quantum Aligned Centroid Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) seems to show potential for application in machine learning (ML). In particular quantum kernel methods (QKM) exhibit promising properties for use in supervised ML tasks. However, a major disadvantage of kernel methods is their unfavorable quadratic scaling with the number of training samples. Together with the limits imposed by currently available quantum hardware (NISQ devices) with their low qubit coherence times, small number of qubits, and high error rates, the use of QC in ML at an industrially relevant scale is currently impossible. As a small step in improving the potential applications of QKMs, we introduce QUACK, a quantum kernel algorithm whose time complexity scales linear with the number of samples during training, and independent of the number of training samples in the inference stage. In the training process, only the kernel entries for the samples and the centers of the classes are calculated, i.e. the maximum shape of the kernel for n samples and c classes is (n, c). During training, the parameters of the quantum kernel and the positions of the centroids are optimized iteratively. In the inference stage, for every new sample the circuit is only evaluated for every centroid, i.e. c times. We show that the QUACK algorithm nevertheless provides satisfactory results and can perform at a similar level as classical kernel methods with quadratic scaling during training. In addition, our (simulated) algorithm is able to handle high-dimensional datasets such as MNIST with 784 features without any dimensionality reduction.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Splitting of Reusable Temporal Monitors for Rare Traffic Violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are often tested in simulation to estimate the probability they will violate safety specifications. Two common issues arise when using existing techniques to produce this estimation: If violations occur rarely, simple Monte-Carlo sampling techniques can fail to produce efficient estimates; if simulation horizons are too long, importance sampling techniques (which learn proposal distributions from past simulations) can fail to converge. This paper addresses both issues by interleaving rare-event sampling techniques with online specification monitoring algorithms. We use adaptive multi-level splitting to decompose simulations into partial trajectories, then calculate the distance of those partial trajectories to failure by leveraging robustness metrics from Signal Temporal Logic (STL). By caching those partial robustness metric values, we can efficiently re-use computations across multiple sampling stages. Our experiments on an interstate lane-change scenario show our method is viable for testing simulated AV-pipelines, efficiently estimating failure probabilities for STL specifications based on real traffic rules. We produce better estimates than Monte-Carlo and importance sampling in fewer simulations.</description>

      <title>Probing the Information Theoretical Roots of Spatial Dependence Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intuitively, there is a relation between measures of spatial dependence and information theoretical measures of entropy. For instance, we can provide an intuition of why spatial data is special by stating that, on average, spatial data samples contain less than expected information. Similarly, spatial data, e.g., remotely sensed imagery, that is easy to compress is also likely to show significant spatial autocorrelation. Formulating our (highly specific) core concepts of spatial information theory in the widely used language of information theory opens new perspectives on their differences and similarities and also fosters cross-disciplinary collaboration, e.g., with the broader AI/ML communities. Interestingly, however, this intuitive relation is challenging to formalize and generalize, leading prior work to rely mostly on experimental results, e.g., for describing landscape patterns. In this work, we will explore the information theoretical roots of spatial autocorrelation, more specifically Moran's I, through the lens of self-information (also known as surprisal) and provide both formal proofs and experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach in the Multimodal Learning Analytics field. Within this approach, we have developed a tool to visualize and analyze eye movement data collected during learning sessions in online courses. The tool is named VAAD, an acronym for Visual Attention Analysis Dashboard. These eye movement data have been gathered using an eye-tracker and subsequently processed and visualized for interpretation. The purpose of the tool is to conduct a descriptive analysis of the data by facilitating its visualization, enabling the identification of differences and learning patterns among various learner populations. Additionally, it integrates a predictive module capable of anticipating learner activities during a learning session. Consequently, VAAD holds the potential to offer valuable insights into online learning behaviors from both descriptive and predictive perspectives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence techniques are increasingly being applied to solve control problems, but often rely on black-box methods without transparent output generation. To improve the interpretability and transparency in control systems, models can be defined as white-box symbolic policies described by mathematical expressions. While current approaches to learn symbolic policies focus on static policies that directly map observations to control signals, these may fail in partially observable and volatile environments. We instead consider dynamic symbolic policies with memory, optimised with genetic programming. The resulting policies are robust, and consist of easy to interpret coupled differential equations. Our results show that dynamic symbolic policies compare with black-box policies on a variety of control tasks. Furthermore, the benefit of the memory in dynamic policies is demonstrated on experiments where static policies fall short. Overall, we present a method for evolving high-performing symbolic policies that offer interpretability and transparency, which lacks in black-box models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal interleaved datasets featuring free-form interleaved sequences of images and text are crucial for training frontier large multimodal models (LMMs). Despite the rapid progression of open-source LMMs, there remains a pronounced scarcity of large-scale, diverse open-source multimodal interleaved datasets. In response, we introduce MINT-1T, the most extensive and diverse open-source Multimodal INTerleaved dataset to date. MINT-1T comprises one trillion text tokens and 3.4 billion images, a 10x scale-up from existing open-source datasets. Additionally, we include previously untapped sources such as PDFs and ArXiv papers. As scaling multimodal interleaved datasets requires substantial engineering effort, sharing the data curation process and releasing the dataset greatly benefits the community. Our experiments show that LMMs trained on MINT-1T rival the performance of models trained on the previous leading dataset, OBELICS. Our data and code will be released at https://github.com/mlfoundations/MINT-1T.</description>

      <title>Multi-Convformer: Extending Conformer with Multiple Convolution Kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convolutions have become essential in state-of-the-art end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition~(ASR) systems due to their efficient modelling of local context. Notably, its use in Conformers has led to superior performance compared to vanilla Transformer-based ASR systems. While components other than the convolution module in the Conformer have been reexamined, altering the convolution module itself has been far less explored. Towards this, we introduce Multi-Convformer that uses multiple convolution kernels within the convolution module of the Conformer in conjunction with gating. This helps in improved modeling of local dependencies at varying granularities. Our model rivals existing Conformer variants such as CgMLP and E-Branchformer in performance, while being more parameter efficient. We empirically compare our approach with Conformer and its variants across four different datasets and three different modelling paradigms and show up to 8% relative word error rate~(WER) improvements.</description>

      <title>Enabling On-Device LLMs Personalization with Smartphone Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This demo presents a novel end-to-end framework that combines on-device large language models (LLMs) with smartphone sensing technologies to achieve context-aware and personalized services. The framework addresses critical limitations of current personalization solutions via cloud LLMs, such as privacy concerns, latency and cost, and limited personal information. To achieve this, we innovatively proposed deploying LLMs on smartphones with multimodal sensor data through context-aware sensing and customized prompt engineering, ensuring privacy and enhancing personalization performance. A case study involving a university student demonstrated the capability of the framework to provide tailored recommendations. In addition, we show that the framework achieves the best trade-off in privacy, performance, latency, cost, battery and energy consumption between on-device and cloud LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework to provide on-device LLMs personalization with smartphone sensing. Future work will incorporate more diverse sensor data and involve extensive user studies to enhance personalization. Our proposed framework has the potential to substantially improve user experiences across domains including healthcare, productivity, and entertainment.</description>

      <title>Empirical analysis of Binding Precedent efficiency in the Brazilian Supreme Court via Similar Case Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binding precedents (S\'umulas Vinculantes) constitute a juridical instrument unique to the Brazilian legal system and whose objectives include the protection of the Federal Supreme Court against repetitive demands. Studies of the effectiveness of these instruments in decreasing the Court's exposure to similar cases, however, indicate that they tend to fail in such a direction, with some of the binding precedents seemingly creating new demands. We empirically assess the legal impact of five binding precedents, 11, 14, 17, 26 and 37, at the highest court level through their effects on the legal subjects they address. This analysis is only possible through the comparison of the Court's ruling about the precedents' themes before they are created, which means that these decisions should be detected through techniques of Similar Case Retrieval. The contributions of this article are therefore twofold: on the mathematical side, we compare the uses of different methods of Natural Language Processing -- TF-IDF, LSTM, BERT, and regex -- for Similar Case Retrieval, whereas on the legal side, we contrast the inefficiency of these binding precedents with a set of hypotheses that may justify their repeated usage. We observe that the deep learning models performed significantly worse in the specific Similar Case Retrieval task and that the reasons for binding precedents to fail in responding to repetitive demand are heterogeneous and case-dependent, making it impossible to single out a specific cause.</description>

      <title>CADC: Encoding User-Item Interactions for Compressing Recommendation Model Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) are at the heart of the current e-commerce industry. However, the amount of training data used to train these large models is growing exponentially, leading to substantial training hurdles. The training dataset contains two primary types of information: content-based information (features of users and items) and collaborative information (interactions between users and items). One approach to reduce the training dataset is to remove user-item interactions. But that significantly diminishes collaborative information, which is crucial for maintaining accuracy due to its inclusion of interaction histories. This loss profoundly impacts DLRM performance.
  This paper makes an important observation that if one can capture the user-item interaction history to enrich the user and item embeddings, then the interaction history can be compressed without losing model accuracy. Thus, this work, Collaborative Aware Data Compression (CADC), takes a two-step approach to training dataset compression. In the first step, we use matrix factorization of the user-item interaction matrix to create a novel embedding representation for both the users and items. Once the user and item embeddings are enriched by the interaction history information the approach then applies uniform random sampling of the training dataset to drastically reduce the training dataset size while minimizing model accuracy drop. The source code of CADC is available at \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DSS-RM-8C1D/README.md}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DSS-RM-8C1D/README.md}.</description>

Abstract: We introduce, Q-Sparse, a simple yet effective approach to training sparsely-activated large language models (LLMs). Q-Sparse enables full sparsity of activations in LLMs which can bring significant efficiency gains in inference. This is achieved by applying top-K sparsification to the activations and the straight-through-estimator to the training. We also introduce Block Q-Sparse for batch training and inference. The key results from this work are, (1) Q-Sparse can achieve results comparable to those of baseline LLMs while being much more efficient at inference time; (2) We present an inference-optimal scaling law for sparsely-activated LLMs; (3) Q-Sparse is effective in different settings, including training-from-scratch, continue-training of off-the-shelf LLMs, and finetuning; (4) Q-Sparse works for both full-precision and 1-bit LLMs (e.g., BitNet b1.58). Particularly, the synergy of BitNet b1.58 and Q-Sparse (can be equipped with MoE) provides the cornerstone and a clear path to revolutionize the efficiency, including cost and energy consumption, of future LLMs.</description>

      <title>Proof-of-Collaborative-Learning: A Multi-winner Federated Learning Consensus Algorithm</title>

Abstract: Regardless of their variations, blockchains require a consensus mechanism to validate transactions, supervise added blocks, maintain network security, synchronize the network state, and distribute incentives. Proof-of-Work (PoW), one of the most influential implementations of consensus mechanisms, consumes an extraordinary amount of energy for a task that lacks direct productive output. In this paper, we propose Proof-of-Collaborative-Learning (PoCL), a multi-winner federated learning validated consensus mechanism that redirects the computation power of blockchains to train federated learning models. In addition, we present a novel evaluation mechanism to ensure the efficiency of the locally trained models of miners. We evaluated the security of our evaluation mechanism by introducing and conducting probable attacks. Moreover, we present a novel reward distribution mechanism to incentivize winning miners fairly, and demonstrate that our reward system is fair both within and across all rounds.</description>

      <title>Consent in Crisis: The Rapid Decline of the AI Data Commons</title>

Abstract: General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems are built on massive swathes of public web data, assembled into corpora such as C4, RefinedWeb, and Dolma. To our knowledge, we conduct the first, large-scale, longitudinal audit of the consent protocols for the web domains underlying AI training corpora. Our audit of 14,000 web domains provides an expansive view of crawlable web data and how codified data use preferences are changing over time. We observe a proliferation of AI-specific clauses to limit use, acute differences in restrictions on AI developers, as well as general inconsistencies between websites' expressed intentions in their Terms of Service and their robots.txt. We diagnose these as symptoms of ineffective web protocols, not designed to cope with the widespread re-purposing of the internet for AI. Our longitudinal analyses show that in a single year (2023-2024) there has been a rapid crescendo of data restrictions from web sources, rendering ~5%+ of all tokens in C4, or 28%+ of the most actively maintained, critical sources in C4, fully restricted from use. For Terms of Service crawling restrictions, a full 45% of C4 is now restricted. If respected or enforced, these restrictions are rapidly biasing the diversity, freshness, and scaling laws for general-purpose AI systems. We hope to illustrate the emerging crises in data consent, for both developers and creators. The foreclosure of much of the open web will impact not only commercial AI, but also non-commercial AI and academic research.</description>

      <title>A spatiotemporal deep learning framework for prediction of crack dynamics in heterogeneous solids: efficient mapping of concrete microstructures to its fracture properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spatiotemporal deep learning framework is proposed that is capable of 2D full-field prediction of fracture in concrete mesostructures. This framework not only predicts fractures but also captures the entire history of the fracture process, from the crack initiation in the interfacial transition zone to the subsequent propagation of the cracks in the mortar matrix. In addition, a convolutional neural network is developed which can predict the averaged stress-strain curve of the mesostructures. The UNet modeling framework, which comprises an encoder-decoder section with skip connections, is used as the deep learning surrogate model. Training and test data are generated from high-fidelity fracture simulations of randomly generated concrete mesostructures. These mesostructures include geometric variabilities such as different aggregate particle geometrical features, spatial distribution, and the total volume fraction of aggregates. The fracture simulations are carried out in Abaqus, utilizing the cohesive phase-field fracture modeling technique as the fracture modeling approach. In this work, to reduce the number of training datasets, the spatial distribution of three sets of material properties for three-phase concrete mesostructures, along with the spatial phase-field damage index, are fed to the UNet to predict the corresponding stress and spatial damage index at the subsequent step. It is shown that after the training process using this methodology, the UNet model is capable of accurately predicting damage on the unseen test dataset by using 470 datasets. Moreover, another novel aspect of this work is the conversion of irregular finite element data into regular grids using a developed pipeline. This approach allows for the implementation of less complex UNet architecture and facilitates the integration of phase-field fracture equations into surrogate models for future developments.</description>

      <title>Self-driving lab discovers principles for steering spontaneous emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We developed an autonomous experimentation platform to accelerate interpretable scientific discovery in ultrafast nanophotonics, targeting a novel method to steer spontaneous emission from reconfigurable semiconductor metasurfaces. Controlling spontaneous emission is crucial for clean-energy solutions in illumination, thermal radiation engineering, and remote sensing. Despite the potential of reconfigurable semiconductor metasurfaces with embedded sources for spatiotemporal control, achieving arbitrary far-field control remains challenging. Here, we present a self-driving lab (SDL) platform that addresses this challenge by discovering the governing equations for predicting the far-field emission profile from light-emitting metasurfaces. We discover that both the spatial gradient (grating-like) and the curvature (lens-like) of the local refractive index are key factors in steering spontaneous emission. The SDL employs a machine-learning framework comprising: (1) a variational autoencoder for generating complex spatial refractive index profiles, (2) an active learning agent for guiding experiments with real-time closed-loop feedback, and (3) a neural network-based equation learner to uncover structure-property relationships. The SDL demonstrated a four-fold enhancement in peak emission directivity (up to 77%) over a 72{\deg} field of view within ~300 experiments. Our findings reveal that combinations of positive gratings and lenses are as effective as negative lenses and gratings for all emission angles, offering a novel strategy for controlling spontaneous emission beyond conventional Fourier optics.</description>

      <title>On the Utility of Speech and Audio Foundation Models for Marmoset Call Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Marmoset monkeys encode vital information in their calls and serve as a surrogate model for neuro-biologists to understand the evolutionary origins of human vocal communication. Traditionally analyzed with signal processing-based features, recent approaches have utilized self-supervised models pre-trained on human speech for feature extraction, capitalizing on their ability to learn a signal's intrinsic structure independently of its acoustic domain. However, the utility of such foundation models remains unclear for marmoset call analysis in terms of multi-class classification, bandwidth, and pre-training domain. This study assesses feature representations derived from speech and general audio domains, across pre-training bandwidths of 4, 8, and 16 kHz for marmoset call-type and caller classification tasks. Results show that models with higher bandwidth improve performance, and pre-training on speech or general audio yields comparable results, improving over a spectral baseline.</description>

      <title>A Simulation Benchmark for Autonomous Racing with Large-Scale Human Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the availability of international prize-money competitions, scaled vehicles, and simulation environments, research on autonomous racing and the control of sports cars operating close to the limit of handling has been limited by the high costs of vehicle acquisition and management, as well as the limited physics accuracy of open-source simulators. In this paper, we propose a racing simulation platform based on the simulator Assetto Corsa to test, validate, and benchmark autonomous driving algorithms, including reinforcement learning (RL) and classical Model Predictive Control (MPC), in realistic and challenging scenarios. Our contributions include the development of this simulation platform, several state-of-the-art algorithms tailored to the racing environment, and a comprehensive dataset collected from human drivers. Additionally, we evaluate algorithms in the offline RL setting. All the necessary code (including environment and benchmarks), working examples, datasets, and videos are publicly released and can be found at: https://assetto-corsa-gym.github.io</description>
