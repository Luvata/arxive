      <description>arXiv:2408.16002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning: Fundamentals and Theory" offers a comprehensive exploration of the foundational principles and advanced methodologies in neural networks and deep learning. This book begins with essential concepts in descriptive statistics and probability theory, laying a solid groundwork for understanding data and probability distributions. As the reader progresses, they are introduced to matrix calculus and gradient optimization, crucial for training and fine-tuning neural networks. The book delves into multilayer feed-forward neural networks, explaining their architecture, training processes, and the backpropagation algorithm. Key challenges in neural network optimization, such as activation function saturation, vanishing and exploding gradients, and weight initialization, are thoroughly discussed. The text covers various learning rate schedules and adaptive algorithms, providing strategies to optimize the training process. Techniques for generalization and hyperparameter tuning, including Bayesian optimization and Gaussian processes, are also presented to enhance model performance and prevent overfitting. Advanced activation functions are explored in detail, categorized into sigmoid-based, ReLU-based, ELU-based, miscellaneous, non-standard, and combined types. Each activation function is examined for its properties and applications, offering readers a deep understanding of their impact on neural network behavior. The final chapter introduces complex-valued neural networks, discussing complex numbers, functions, and visualizations, as well as complex calculus and backpropagation algorithms. This book equips readers with the knowledge and skills necessary to design, and optimize advanced neural network models, contributing to the ongoing advancements in artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Toward Time-Continuous Data Inference in Sparse Urban CrowdSensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) is a promising paradigm that leverages mobile users and their smart portable devices to perform various real-world tasks. However, due to budget constraints and the inaccessibility of certain areas, Sparse MCS has emerged as a more practical alternative, collecting data from a limited number of target subareas and utilizing inference algorithms to complete the full sensing map. While existing approaches typically assume a time-discrete setting with data remaining constant within each sensing cycle, this simplification can introduce significant errors, especially when dealing with long cycles, as real-world sensing data often changes continuously. In this paper, we go from fine-grained completion, i.e., the subdivision of sensing cycles into minimal time units, towards a more accurate, time-continuous completion. We first introduce Deep Matrix Factorization (DMF) as a neural network-enabled framework and enhance it with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN-DMF) to capture temporal correlations in these finer time slices. To further deal with the continuous data, we propose TIME-DMF, which captures temporal information across unequal intervals, enabling time-continuous completion. Additionally, we present the Query-Generate (Q-G) strategy within TIME-DMF to model the infinite states of continuous data. Extensive experiments across five types of sensing tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our models and the advantages of time-continuous completion.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learn Unimodal Signals with Weak Supervision for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to effectively integrate information from various sources to infer sentiment, where in many cases there are no annotations for unimodal labels. Therefore, most works rely on multimodal labels for training. However, there exists the noisy label problem for the learning of unimodal signals as multimodal annotations are not always the ideal substitutes for the unimodal ones, failing to achieve finer optimization for individual modalities. In this paper, we explore the learning of unimodal labels under the weak supervision from the annotated multimodal labels. Specifically, we propose a novel meta uni-label generation (MUG) framework to address the above problem, which leverages the available multimodal labels to learn the corresponding unimodal labels by the meta uni-label correction network (MUCN). We first design a contrastive-based projection module to bridge the gap between unimodal and multimodal representations, so as to use multimodal annotations to guide the learning of MUCN. Afterwards, we propose unimodal and multimodal denoising tasks to train MUCN with explicit supervision via a bi-level optimization strategy. We then jointly train unimodal and multimodal learning tasks to extract discriminative unimodal features for multimodal inference. Experimental results suggest that MUG outperforms competitive baselines and can learn accurate unimodal labels.</description>

      <title>EMP: Enhance Memory in Data Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, large language and vision models have shown strong performance, but due to high pre-training and fine-tuning costs, research has shifted towards faster training via dataset pruning. Previous methods used sample loss as an evaluation criterion, aiming to select the most "difficult" samples for training. However, when the pruning rate increases, the number of times each sample is trained becomes more evenly distributed, which causes many critical or general samples to not be effectively fitted. We refer to this as Low-Frequency Learning (LFL). In other words, LFL prevents the model from remembering most samples. In our work, we decompose the scoring function of LFL, provide a theoretical explanation for the inefficiency of LFL, and propose adding a memory term to the scoring function to enhance the model's memory capability, along with an approximation of this memory term. Similarly, we explore memory in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), marking the first discussion on SSL memory. Using contrastive learning, we derive the memory term both theoretically and experimentally. Finally, we propose Enhance Memory Pruning (EMP), which addresses the issue of insufficient memory under high pruning rates by enhancing the model's memory of data, thereby improving its performance. We evaluated the performance of EMP in tasks such as image classification, natural language understanding, and model pre-training. The results show that EMP can improve model performance under extreme pruning rates. For example, in the CIFAR100-ResNet50 pre-training task, with 70\% pruning, EMP outperforms current methods by 2.2\%.</description>

      <title>An Extremely Data-efficient and Generative LLM-based Reinforcement Learning Agent for Recommenders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled understanding webpage contexts, product details, and human instructions. Utilizing LLMs as the foundational architecture for either reward models or policies in reinforcement learning has gained popularity -- a notable achievement is the success of InstructGPT. RL algorithms have been instrumental in maximizing long-term customer satisfaction and avoiding short-term, myopic goals in industrial recommender systems, which often rely on deep learning models to predict immediate clicks or purchases.
  In this project, several RL methods are implemented and evaluated using the WebShop benchmark environment, data, simulator, and pre-trained model checkpoints. The goal is to train an RL agent to maximize the purchase reward given a detailed human instruction describing a desired product. The RL agents are developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model with various objectives, learning from preferences without a reward model, and employing contemporary training techniques such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as used in InstructGPT, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This report also evaluates the RL agents trained using generative trajectories. Evaluations were conducted using Thompson sampling in the WebShop simulator environment.
  The simulated online experiments demonstrate that agents trained on generated trajectories exhibited comparable task performance to those trained using human trajectories. This has demonstrated an example of an extremely low-cost data-efficient way of training reinforcement learning agents. Also, with limited training time (&lt;2hours), without utilizing any images, a DPO agent achieved a 19% success rate after approximately 3000 steps or 30 minutes of training on T4 GPUs, compared to a PPO agent, which reached a 15% success rate.</description>

      <title>Fairness, Accuracy, and Unreliable Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates three areas targeted at improving the reliability of machine learning; fairness in machine learning, strategic classification, and algorithmic robustness. Each of these domains has special properties or structure that can complicate learning. A theme throughout this thesis is thinking about ways in which a `plain' empirical risk minimization algorithm will be misleading or ineffective because of a mis-match between classical learning theory assumptions and specific properties of some data distribution in the wild. Theoretical understanding in eachof these domains can help guide best practices and allow for the design of effective, reliable, and robust systems.</description>

      <title>Scaling Up Diffusion and Flow-based XGBoost Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel machine learning methods for tabular data generation are often developed on small datasets which do not match the scale required for scientific applications. We investigate a recent proposal to use XGBoost as the function approximator in diffusion and flow-matching models on tabular data, which proved to be extremely memory intensive, even on tiny datasets. In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of the existing implementation from an engineering perspective, and show that these limitations are not fundamental to the method; with better implementation it can be scaled to datasets 370x larger than previously used. Our efficient implementation also unlocks scaling models to much larger sizes which we show directly leads to improved performance on benchmark tasks. We also propose algorithmic improvements that can further benefit resource usage and model performance, including multi-output trees which are well-suited to generative modeling. Finally, we present results on large-scale scientific datasets derived from experimental particle physics as part of the Fast Calorimeter Simulation Challenge.

      <title>Ensuring Equitable Financial Decisions: Leveraging Counterfactual Fairness and Deep Learning for Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concerns regarding fairness and bias have been raised in recent years due to the growing use of machine learning models in crucial decision-making processes, especially when it comes to delicate characteristics like gender. In order to address biases in machine learning models, this research paper investigates advanced bias mitigation techniques, with a particular focus on counterfactual fairness in conjunction with data augmentation. The study looks into how these integrated approaches can lessen gender bias in the financial industry, specifically in loan approval procedures. We show that these approaches are effective in achieving more equitable results through thorough testing and assessment on a skewed financial dataset. The findings emphasize how crucial it is to use fairness-aware techniques when creating machine learning models in order to guarantee morally righteous and impartial decision-making.</description>

      <title>EPO: Hierarchical LLM Agents with Environment Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-horizon decision-making tasks present significant challenges for LLM-based agents due to the need for extensive planning over multiple steps. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical framework that decomposes complex tasks into manageable subgoals, utilizing separate LLMs for subgoal prediction and low-level action generation. To address the challenge of creating training signals for unannotated datasets, we develop a reward model that leverages multimodal environment feedback to automatically generate reward signals. We introduce Environment Preference Optimization (EPO), a novel method that generates preference signals from the environment's feedback and uses them to train LLM-based agents. Extensive experiments on ALFRED demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our framework, achieving first place on the ALFRED public leaderboard and showcasing its potential to improve long-horizon decision-making in diverse environments.</description>

      <title>Negative Binomial Matrix Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix completion focuses on recovering missing or incomplete information in matrices. This problem arises in various applications, including image processing and network analysis. Previous research proposed Poisson matrix completion for count data with noise that follows a Poisson distribution, which assumes that the mean and variance are equal. Since overdispersed count data, whose variance is greater than the mean, is more likely to occur in realistic settings, we assume that the noise follows the negative binomial (NB) distribution, which can be more general than the Poisson distribution. In this paper, we introduce NB matrix completion by proposing a nuclear-norm regularized model that can be solved by proximal gradient descent. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the NB model outperforms Poisson matrix completion in various noise and missing data settings on real data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of learning uncertainty-aware representations for graph-structured data. While Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (GNODE) are effective in learning node representations, they fail to quantify uncertainty. To address this, we introduce Latent Graph Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (LGNSDE), which enhance GNODE by embedding randomness through Brownian motion to quantify uncertainty. We provide theoretical guarantees for LGNSDE and empirically show better performance in uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>RAIN: Reinforcement Algorithms for Improving Numerical Weather and Climate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with idealised climate models to address key parameterisation challenges in climate science. Current climate models rely on complex mathematical parameterisations to represent sub-grid scale processes, which can introduce substantial uncertainties. RL offers capabilities to enhance these parameterisation schemes, including direct interaction, handling sparse or delayed feedback, continuous online learning, and long-term optimisation. We evaluate the performance of eight RL algorithms on two idealised environments: one for temperature bias correction, another for radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) imitating real-world computational constraints. Results show different RL approaches excel in different climate scenarios with exploration algorithms performing better in bias correction, while exploitation algorithms proving more effective for RCE. These findings support the potential of RL-based parameterisation schemes to be integrated into global climate models, improving accuracy and efficiency in capturing complex climate dynamics. Overall, this work represents an important first step towards leveraging RL to enhance climate model accuracy, critical for improving climate understanding and predictions.

      <title>Variational Mode Decomposition and Linear Embeddings are What You Need For Time-Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-series forecasting often faces challenges due to data volatility, which can lead to inaccurate predictions. Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) has emerged as a promising technique to mitigate volatility by decomposing data into distinct modes, thereby enhancing forecast accuracy. In this study, we integrate VMD with linear models to develop a robust forecasting framework. Our approach is evaluated on 13 diverse datasets, including ETTm2, WindTurbine, M4, and 10 air quality datasets from various Southeast Asian cities. The effectiveness of the VMD strategy is assessed by comparing Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values from models utilizing VMD against those without it. Additionally, we benchmark linear-based models against well-known neural network architectures such as LSTM, BLSTM, and RNN. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in RMSE across nearly all models following VMD application. Notably, the Linear + VMD model achieved the lowest average RMSE in univariate forecasting at 0.619. In multivariate forecasting, the DLinear + VMD model consistently outperformed others, attaining the lowest RMSE across all datasets with an average of 0.019. These findings underscore the effectiveness of combining VMD with linear models for superior time-series forecasting.</description>

      <title>Thinner Latent Spaces: Detecting dimension and imposing invariance through autoencoder gradient constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal Autoencoders are a neural network architecture that imposes orthogonality conditions between the gradients of latent variables towards achieving disentangled representations of data. In this letter we show that orthogonality relations within the latent layer of the network can be leveraged to infer the intrinsic dimensionality of nonlinear manifold data sets (locally characterized by the dimension of their tangent space), while simultaneously computing encoding and decoding (embedding) maps. We outline the relevant theory relying on differential geometry, and describe the corresponding gradient-descent optimization algorithm. The method is applied to standard data sets and we highlight its applicability, advantages, and shortcomings. In addition, we demonstrate that the same computational technology can be used to build coordinate invariance to local group actions when defined only on a (reduced) submanifold of the embedding space.</description>

      <title>Improving the Prediction of Individual Engagement in Recommendations Using Cognitive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For public health programs with limited resources, the ability to predict how behaviors change over time and in response to interventions is crucial for deciding when and to whom interventions should be allocated. Using data from a real-world maternal health program, we demonstrate how a cognitive model based on Instance-Based Learning (IBL) Theory can augment existing purely computational approaches. Our findings show that, compared to general time-series forecasters (e.g., LSTMs), IBL models, which reflect human decision-making processes, better predict the dynamics of individuals' states. Additionally, IBL provides estimates of the volatility in individuals' states and their sensitivity to interventions, which can improve the efficiency of training of other time series models.</description>

      <title>CLPNets: Coupled Lie-Poisson Neural Networks for Multi-Part Hamiltonian Systems with Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To accurately compute data-based prediction of Hamiltonian systems, especially the long-term evolution of such systems, it is essential to utilize methods that preserve the structure of the equations over time. We consider a case that is particularly challenging for data-based methods: systems with interacting parts that do not reduce to pure momentum evolution. Such systems are essential in scientific computations. For example, any discretization of a continuum elastic rod can be viewed as interacting elements that can move and rotate in space, with each discrete element moving on the group of rotations and translations $SE(3)$.
  We develop a novel method of data-based computation and complete phase space learning of such systems. We follow the original framework of \emph{SympNets} (Jin et al, 2020) building the neural network from canonical phase space mappings, and transformations that preserve the Lie-Poisson structure (\emph{LPNets}) as in (Eldred et al, 2024). We derive a novel system of mappings that are built into neural networks for coupled systems. We call such networks Coupled Lie-Poisson Neural Networks, or \emph{CLPNets}. We consider increasingly complex examples for the applications of CLPNets: rotation of two rigid bodies about a common axis, the free rotation of two rigid bodies, and finally the evolution of two connected and interacting $SE(3)$ components. Our method preserves all Casimir invariants of each system to machine precision, irrespective of the quality of the training data, and preserves energy to high accuracy. Our method also shows good resistance to the curse of dimensionality, requiring only a few thousand data points for all cases studied, with the effective dimension varying from three to eighteen. Additionally, the method is highly economical in memory requirements, requiring only about 200 parameters for the most complex case considered.</description>

      <title>Free Lunch in the Forest: Functionally-Identical Pruning of Boosted Tree Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree ensembles, including boosting methods, are highly effective and widely used for tabular data. However, large ensembles lack interpretability and require longer inference times. We introduce a method to prune a tree ensemble into a reduced version that is "functionally identical" to the original model. In other words, our method guarantees that the prediction function stays unchanged for any possible input. As a consequence, this pruning algorithm is lossless for any aggregated metric. We formalize the problem of functionally identical pruning on ensembles, introduce an exact optimization model, and provide a fast yet highly effective method to prune large ensembles. Our algorithm iteratively prunes considering a finite set of points, which is incrementally augmented using an adversarial model. In multiple computational experiments, we show that our approach is a "free lunch", significantly reducing the ensemble size without altering the model's behavior. Thus, we can preserve state-of-the-art performance at a fraction of the original model's size.</description>

      <title>LeMON: Learning to Learn Multi-Operator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-operator learning involves training a deep neural network to learn a specific operator, whereas recent work in multi-operator learning uses an operator embedding structure to train a single neural network on data from multiple operators. Thus, multi-operator learning is capable of predicting a range of operators within one model. In this work, we propose pretraining and fine-tuning strategies for solving PDEs using multi-operator learning. One key aspect is that by increasing the number of families of operators used in pretraining, a PDE foundation model can be fine-tuned to downstream tasks involving new PDEs with a limited number of samples, thus outperforming single operator neural networks. Specifically, a multi-operator learning model pre-trained with data from diverse PDE families can predict unseen operators after fine-tuning with only a limited number of operators from the new family, enabling them to serve as a data-free PDE solver. We also show that the proposed training and fine-tuning method is able to predict new operators in zero-shot prediction without samples. Additionally, we introduce a PDE-agnostic meta-learning algorithm to improve the adaptability of the model to various PDEs by providing a better parameter initialization process. To address the needs of applications with limited computing resources, we explore low-rank adaptation methods that reduce computational costs while enhancing solver accuracy. Lastly, by examining the scaling law with respect to the number of operator families, we establish and highlight its potential for broad adaptation in PDE-solving tasks.</description>

      <title>Simulating realistic short tandem repeat capillary electrophoretic signal using a generative adversarial network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA profiles are made up from multiple series of electrophoretic signal measuring fluorescence over time. Typically, human DNA analysts 'read' DNA profiles using their experience to distinguish instrument noise, artefactual signal, and signal corresponding to DNA fragments of interest. Recent work has developed an artificial neural network, ANN, to carry out the task of classifying fluorescence types into categories in DNA profile electrophoretic signal. But the creation of the necessarily large amount of labelled training data for the ANN is time consuming and expensive, and a limiting factor in the ability to robustly train the ANN. If realistic, prelabelled, training data could be simulated then this would remove the barrier to training an ANN with high efficacy. Here we develop a generative adversarial network, GAN, modified from the pix2pix GAN to achieve this task. With 1078 DNA profiles we train the GAN and achieve the ability to simulate DNA profile information, and then use the generator from the GAN as a 'realism filter' that applies the noise and artefact elements exhibited in typical electrophoretic signal.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a group of novel datasets representing real-time time-series and streaming data of energy prices in New Zealand, sourced from the Electricity Market Information (EMI) website maintained by the New Zealand government. The datasets are intended to address the scarcity of proper datasets for streaming regression learning tasks. We conduct extensive analyses and experiments on these datasets, covering preprocessing techniques, regression tasks, prediction intervals, concept drift detection, and anomaly detection. Our experiments demonstrate the datasets' utility and highlight the challenges and opportunities for future research in energy price forecasting.</description>

      <title>Variational Mode-Driven Graph Convolutional Network for Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on spatio-temporal (ST) traffic prediction traffic using graph neural networks. Given that ST data consists of non-stationary and complex time events, interpreting and predicting such trends is comparatively complicated. Representation of ST data in modes helps us infer behavior and assess the impact of noise on prediction applications. We propose a framework that decomposes ST data into modes using the variational mode decomposition (VMD) method, which is then fed into the neural network for forecasting future states. This hybrid approach is known as a variational mode graph convolutional network (VMGCN). Instead of exhaustively searching for the number of modes, they are determined using the reconstruction loss from the real-time application data. We also study the significance of each mode and the impact of bandwidth constraints on different horizon predictions in traffic flow data. We evaluate the performance of our proposed network on the LargeST dataset for both short and long-term predictions. Our framework yields better results compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Short-Term Electricity-Load Forecasting by Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-Term Electricity-Load Forecasting (STELF) refers to the prediction of the immediate demand (in the next few hours to several days) for the power system. Various external factors, such as weather changes and the emergence of new electricity consumption scenarios, can impact electricity demand, causing load data to fluctuate and become non-linear, which increases the complexity and difficulty of STELF. In the past decade, deep learning has been applied to STELF, modeling and predicting electricity demand with high accuracy, and contributing significantly to the development of STELF. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on deep-learning-based STELF over the past ten years. It examines the entire forecasting process, including data pre-processing, feature extraction, deep-learning modeling and optimization, and results evaluation. This paper also identifies some research challenges and potential research directions to be further investigated in future work.</description>

      <title>Revisit Micro-batch Clipping: Adaptive Data Pruning via Gradient Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-batch clipping, a gradient clipping method, has recently shown potential in enhancing auto-speech recognition (ASR) model performance. However, the underlying mechanism behind this improvement remains mysterious, particularly the observation that only certain micro-batch sizes are beneficial. In this paper, we make the first attempt to explain this phenomenon. Inspired by recent data pruning research, we assume that specific training samples may impede model convergence during certain training phases. Under this assumption, the convergence analysis shows that micro-batch clipping can improve the convergence rate asymptotically at the cost of an additional constant bias that does not diminish with more training iterations. The bias is dependent on a few factors and can be minimized at specific micro-batch size, thereby elucidating the existence of the sweet-spot micro-batch size observed previously. We also verify the effectiveness of micro-batch clipping beyond speech models on vision and language models, and show promising performance gains in these domains. An exploration of potential limitations shows that micro-batch clipping is less effective when training data originates from multiple distinct domains.</description>

      <title>ReXamine-Global: A Framework for Uncovering Inconsistencies in Radiology Report Generation Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the rapidly expanding capabilities of generative AI models for radiology, there is a need for robust metrics that can accurately measure the quality of AI-generated radiology reports across diverse hospitals. We develop ReXamine-Global, a LLM-powered, multi-site framework that tests metrics across different writing styles and patient populations, exposing gaps in their generalization. First, our method tests whether a metric is undesirably sensitive to reporting style, providing different scores depending on whether AI-generated reports are stylistically similar to ground-truth reports or not. Second, our method measures whether a metric reliably agrees with experts, or whether metric and expert scores of AI-generated report quality diverge for some sites. Using 240 reports from 6 hospitals around the world, we apply ReXamine-Global to 7 established report evaluation metrics and uncover serious gaps in their generalizability. Developers can apply ReXamine-Global when designing new report evaluation metrics, ensuring their robustness across sites. Additionally, our analysis of existing metrics can guide users of those metrics towards evaluation procedures that work reliably at their sites of interest.</description>

      <title>Targeted Cause Discovery with Data-Driven Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel machine learning approach for inferring causal variables of a target variable from observations. Our goal is to identify both direct and indirect causes within a system, thereby efficiently regulating the target variable when the difficulty and cost of intervening on each causal variable vary. Our method employs a neural network trained to identify causality through supervised learning on simulated data. By implementing a local-inference strategy, we achieve linear complexity with respect to the number of variables, efficiently scaling up to thousands of variables. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in identifying causal relationships within large-scale gene regulatory networks, outperforming existing causal discovery methods that primarily focus on direct causality. We validate our model's generalization capability across novel graph structures and generating mechanisms, including gene regulatory networks of E. coli and the human K562 cell line. Implementation codes are available at https://github.com/snu-mllab/Targeted-Cause-Discovery.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Multi-omic Biosequence Transformers for Modeling Peptide-Nucleotide Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transformer architecture has revolutionized bioinformatics and driven progress in the understanding and prediction of the properties of biomolecules. Almost all research on large-scale biosequence transformers has focused on one domain at a time (single-omic), usually nucleotides or peptides. These models have seen incredible success in downstream tasks in each domain and have achieved particularly noteworthy breakthroughs in sequences of peptides and structural modeling. However, these single-omic models are naturally incapable of modeling multi-omic tasks, one of the most biologically critical being nucleotide-peptide interactions.
  We present our work training the first multi-omic nucleotide-peptide foundation models. We show that these multi-omic models (MOMs) can learn joint representations between various single-omic distributions that are emergently consistent with the Central Dogma of molecular biology, despite only being trained on unlabeled biosequences. We further demonstrate that MOMs can be fine-tuned to achieve state-of-the-art results on peptide-nucleotide interaction tasks, namely predicting the change in Gibbs free energy ({\Delta}G) of the binding interaction between a given oligonucleotide and peptide, as well as the effect on this binding interaction due to mutations in the oligonucleotide sequence ({\Delta}{\Delta}G).
  Remarkably, we show that multi-omic biosequence transformers emergently learn useful structural information without any prior structural training, allowing us to predict which peptide residues are most involved in the peptide-nucleotide binding interaction. Lastly, we provide evidence that multi-omic biosequence models are non-inferior to foundation models trained on single-omics distributions, suggesting a more generalized or foundational approach to building these models.</description>

      <title>Iterated Energy-based Flow Matching for Sampling from Boltzmann Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of training a generator from evaluations of energy functions or unnormalized densities. This is a fundamental problem in probabilistic inference, which is crucial for scientific applications such as learning the 3D coordinate distribution of a molecule. To solve this problem, we propose iterated energy-based flow matching (iEFM), the first off-policy approach to train continuous normalizing flow (CNF) models from unnormalized densities. We introduce the simulation-free energy-based flow matching objective, which trains the model to predict the Monte Carlo estimation of the marginal vector field constructed from known energy functions. Our framework is general and can be extended to variance-exploding (VE) and optimal transport (OT) conditional probability paths. We evaluate iEFM on a two-dimensional Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and an eight-dimensional four-particle double-well potential (DW-4) energy function. Our results demonstrate that iEFM outperforms existing methods, showcasing its potential for efficient and scalable probabilistic modeling in complex high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Coalitions of AI-based Methods Predict 15-Year Risks of Breast Cancer Metastasis Using Real-World Clinical Data with AUC up to 0.9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the two cancers responsible for the most deaths in women, with about 42,000 deaths each year in the US. That there are over 300,000 breast cancers newly diagnosed each year suggests that only a fraction of the cancers result in mortality. Thus, most of the women undergo seemingly curative treatment for localized cancers, but a significant later succumb to metastatic disease for which current treatments are only temporizing for the vast majority. The current prognostic metrics are of little actionable value for 4 of the 5 women seemingly cured after local treatment, and many women are exposed to morbid and even mortal adjuvant therapies unnecessarily, with these adjuvant therapies reducing metastatic recurrence by only a third. Thus, there is a need for better prognostics to target aggressive treatment at those who are likely to relapse and spare those who were actually cured. While there is a plethora of molecular and tumor-marker assays in use and under-development to detect recurrence early, these are time consuming, expensive and still often un-validated as to actionable prognostic utility. A different approach would use large data techniques to determine clinical and histopathological parameters that would provide accurate prognostics using existing data. Herein, we report on machine learning, together with grid search and Bayesian Networks to develop algorithms that present a AUC of up to 0.9 in ROC analyses, using only extant data. Such algorithms could be rapidly translated to clinical management as they do not require testing beyond routine tumor evaluations.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Time-Series Training Dataset through Lens of Spectrum in Deep State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates a method to evaluate time-series datasets in terms of the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) with state space models (deep SSMs) trained on the dataset. SSMs have attracted attention as components inside DNNs to address time-series data. Since deep SSMs have powerful representation capacities, training datasets play a crucial role in solving a new task. However, the effectiveness of training datasets cannot be known until deep SSMs are actually trained on them. This can increase the cost of data collection for new tasks, as a trial-and-error process of data collection and time-consuming training are needed to achieve the necessary performance. To advance the practical use of deep SSMs, the metric of datasets to estimate the performance early in the training can be one key element. To this end, we introduce the concept of data evaluation methods used in system identification. In system identification of linear dynamical systems, the effectiveness of datasets is evaluated by using the spectrum of input signals. We introduce this concept to deep SSMs, which are nonlinear dynamical systems. We propose the K-spectral metric, which is the sum of the top-K spectra of signals inside deep SSMs, by focusing on the fact that each layer of a deep SSM can be regarded as a linear dynamical system. Our experiments show that the K-spectral metric has a large absolute value of the correlation coefficient with the performance and can be used to evaluate the quality of training datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the average-reward criterion. We focus on Q-learning algorithms based on relative value iteration (RVI), which are model-free stochastic analogues of the classical RVI method for average-reward MDPs. These algorithms have low per-iteration complexity, making them well-suited for large state space problems. We extend the almost-sure convergence analysis of RVI Q-learning algorithms developed by Abounadi, Bertsekas, and Borkar (2001) from unichain to weakly communicating MDPs. This extension is important both practically and theoretically: weakly communicating MDPs cover a much broader range of applications compared to unichain MDPs, and their optimality equations have a richer solution structure (with multiple degrees of freedom), introducing additional complexity in proving algorithmic convergence. We also characterize the sets to which RVI Q-learning algorithms converge, showing that they are compact, connected, potentially nonconvex, and comprised of solutions to the average-reward optimality equation, with exactly one less degree of freedom than the general solution set of this equation. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to two RVI-based hierarchical average-reward RL algorithms using the options framework, proving their almost-sure convergence and characterizing their sets of convergence under the assumption that the underlying semi-Markov decision process is weakly communicating.</description>

      <title>Web Service QoS Prediction via Extended Canonical Polyadic-based Tensor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today, numerous web services with similar functionalities are available on the Internet. Users often evaluate the Quality of Service (QoS) to choose the best option among them. Predicting the QoS values of these web services is a significant challenge in the field of web services. A Canonical Polyadic (CP)-based tensor network model has proven to be efficient for predicting dynamic QoS data. However, current CP-based tensor network models do not consider the correlation of users and services in the low-dimensional latent feature space, thereby limiting model's prediction capability. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes an Extended Canonical polyadic-based Tensor Network (ECTN) model. It models the correlation of users and services via building a relation dimension between user feature and service feature in low-dimensional space, and then designs an extended CP decomposition structure to improve prediction accuracy. Experiments are conducted on two public dynamic QoS data, and the results show that compared with state-of-the-art QoS prediction models, the ECTN obtains higher prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Customer Churn Prediction in Telecommunications: An Adaptive Ensemble Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Customer churn, the discontinuation of services by existing customers, poses a significant challenge to the telecommunications industry. This paper proposes a novel adaptive ensemble learning framework for highly accurate customer churn prediction. The framework integrates multiple base models, including XGBoost, LightGBM, LSTM, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). These models are strategically combined using a stacking ensemble method, further enhanced by meta-feature generation from base model predictions. A rigorous data preprocessing pipeline, coupled with a multi-faceted feature engineering approach, optimizes model performance. The framework is evaluated on three publicly available telecom churn datasets, demonstrating substantial accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art techniques. The research achieves a remarkable 99.28% accuracy, signifying a major advancement in churn prediction.The implications of this research for developing proactive customer retention strategies withinthe telecommunications industry are discussed.</description>

      <title>ART: Actually Robust Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current interest in deep learning captures the attention of many programmers and researchers. Unfortunately, the lack of a unified schema for developing deep learning models results in methodological inconsistencies, unclear documentation, and problems with reproducibility. Some guidelines have been proposed, yet currently, they lack practical implementations. Furthermore, neural network training often takes on the form of trial and error, lacking a structured and thoughtful process. To alleviate these issues, in this paper, we introduce Art, a Python library designed to help automatically impose rules and standards while developing deep learning pipelines. Art divides model development into a series of smaller steps of increasing complexity, each concluded with a validation check improving the interpretability and robustness of the process. The current version of Art comes equipped with nine predefined steps inspired by Andrej Karpathy's Recipe for Training Neural Networks, a visualization dashboard, and integration with loggers such as Neptune. The code related to this paper is available at: https://github.com/SebChw/Actually-Robust-Training.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Policy Identification in Robust Constrained Markov Decision Processes via Epigraph Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing a safe policy for uncertain environments is crucial in real-world control applications. However, this challenge remains inadequately addressed within the Markov decision process (MDP) framework. This paper presents the first algorithm capable of identifying a near-optimal policy in a robust constrained MDP (RCMDP), where an optimal policy minimizes cumulative cost while satisfying constraints in the worst-case scenario across a set of environments. We first prove that the conventional Lagrangian max-min formulation with policy gradient methods can become trapped in suboptimal solutions by encountering a sum of conflicting gradients from the objective and constraint functions during its inner minimization problem. To address this, we leverage the epigraph form of the RCMDP problem, which resolves the conflict by selecting a single gradient from either the objective or the constraints. Building on the epigraph form, we propose a binary search algorithm with a policy gradient subroutine and prove that it identifies an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in an RCMDP with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ policy evaluations.</description>

      <title>OpenFGL: A Comprehensive Benchmarks for Federated Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) has emerged as a promising distributed training paradigm for graph neural networks across multiple local systems without direct data sharing. This approach is particularly beneficial in privacy-sensitive scenarios and offers a new perspective on addressing scalability challenges in large-scale graph learning. Despite the proliferation of FGL, the diverse motivations from practical applications, spanning various research backgrounds and experimental settings, pose a significant challenge to fair evaluation. To fill this gap, we propose OpenFGL, a unified benchmark designed for the primary FGL scenarios: Graph-FL and Subgraph-FL. Specifically, OpenFGL includes 38 graph datasets from 16 application domains, 8 federated data simulation strategies that emphasize graph properties, and 5 graph-based downstream tasks. Additionally, it offers 18 recently proposed SOTA FGL algorithms through a user-friendly API, enabling a thorough comparison and comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate the ability of FGL while also revealing its potential limitations, offering valuable insights for future exploration in this thriving field.</description>

      <title>Flexible framework for generating synthetic electrocardiograms and photoplethysmograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By generating synthetic biosignals, the quantity and variety of health data can be increased. This is especially useful when training machine learning models by enabling data augmentation and introduction of more physiologically plausible variation to the data. For these purposes, we have developed a synthetic biosignal model for two signal modalities, electrocardiography (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG). The model produces realistic signals that account for physiological effects such as breathing modulation and changes in heart rate due to physical stress. Arrhythmic signals can be generated with beat intervals extracted from real measurements. The model also includes a flexible approach to adding different kinds of noise and signal artifacts. The noise is generated from power spectral densities extracted from both measured noisy signals and modeled power spectra. Importantly, the model also automatically produces labels for noise, segmentation (e.g. P and T waves, QRS complex, for electrocardiograms), and artifacts. We assessed how this comprehensive model can be used in practice to improve the performance of models trained on ECG or PPG data. For example, we trained an LSTM to detect ECG R-peaks using both real ECG signals from the MIT-BIH arrythmia set and our new generator. The F1 score of the model was 0.83 using real data, in comparison to 0.98 using our generator. In addition, the model can be used for example in signal segmentation, quality detection and bench-marking detection algorithms. The model code has been released in \url{https://github.com/UTU-Health-Research/framework_for_synthetic_biosignals}</description>

      <title>Minimising changes to audit when updating decision trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretable models are important, but what happens when the model is updated on new training data? We propose an algorithm for updating a decision tree while minimising the number of changes to the tree that a human would need to audit. We achieve this via a greedy approach that incorporates the number of changes to the tree as part of the objective function. We compare our algorithm to existing methods and show that it sits in a sweet spot between final accuracy and number of changes to audit.</description>

      <title>Self-Improving Diffusion Models with Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The artificial intelligence (AI) world is running out of real data for training increasingly large generative models, resulting in accelerating pressure to train on synthetic data. Unfortunately, training new generative models with synthetic data from current or past generation models creates an autophagous (self-consuming) loop that degrades the quality and/or diversity of the synthetic data in what has been termed model autophagy disorder (MAD) and model collapse. Current thinking around model autophagy recommends that synthetic data is to be avoided for model training lest the system deteriorate into MADness. In this paper, we take a different tack that treats synthetic data differently from real data. Self-IMproving diffusion models with Synthetic data (SIMS) is a new training concept for diffusion models that uses self-synthesized data to provide negative guidance during the generation process to steer a model's generative process away from the non-ideal synthetic data manifold and towards the real data distribution. We demonstrate that SIMS is capable of self-improvement; it establishes new records based on the Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) metric for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-64 generation and achieves competitive results on FFHQ-64 and ImageNet-512. Moreover, SIMS is, to the best of our knowledge, the first prophylactic generative AI algorithm that can be iteratively trained on self-generated synthetic data without going MAD. As a bonus, SIMS can adjust a diffusion model's synthetic data distribution to match any desired in-domain target distribution to help mitigate biases and ensure fairness.</description>

      <title>GL-TSVM: A robust and smooth twin support vector machine with guardian loss function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twin support vector machine (TSVM), a variant of support vector machine (SVM), has garnered significant attention due to its $3/4$ times lower computational complexity compared to SVM. However, due to the utilization of the hinge loss function, TSVM is sensitive to outliers or noise. To remedy it, we introduce the guardian loss (G-loss), a novel loss function distinguished by its asymmetric, bounded, and smooth characteristics. We then fuse the proposed G-loss function into the TSVM and yield a robust and smooth classifier termed GL-TSVM. Further, to adhere to the structural risk minimization (SRM) principle and reduce overfitting, we incorporate a regularization term into the objective function of GL-TSVM. To address the optimization challenges of GL-TSVM, we devise an efficient iterative algorithm. The experimental analysis on UCI and KEEL datasets substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed GL-TSVM in comparison to the baseline models. Moreover, to showcase the efficacy of the proposed GL-TSVM in the biomedical domain, we evaluated it on the breast cancer (BreaKHis) and schizophrenia datasets. The outcomes strongly demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed GL-TSVM against the baseline models.</description>

      <title>Do Graph Neural Networks Work for High Entropy Alloys?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have excelled in predictive modeling for both crystals and molecules, owing to the expressiveness of graph representations. High-entropy alloys (HEAs), however, lack chemical long-range order, limiting the applicability of current graph representations. To overcome this challenge, we propose a representation of HEAs as a collection of local environment (LE) graphs. Based on this representation, we introduce the LESets machine learning model, an accurate, interpretable GNN for HEA property prediction. We demonstrate the accuracy of LESets in modeling the mechanical properties of quaternary HEAs. Through analyses and interpretation, we further extract insights into the modeling and design of HEAs. In a broader sense, LESets extends the potential applicability of GNNs to disordered materials with combinatorial complexity formed by diverse constituents and their flexible configurations.</description>

      <title>TG-PhyNN: An Enhanced Physically-Aware Graph Neural Network framework for forecasting Spatio-Temporal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately forecasting dynamic processes on graphs, such as traffic flow or disease spread, remains a challenge. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling and forecasting spatio-temporal data, they often lack the ability to directly incorporate underlying physical laws. This work presents TG-PhyNN, a novel Temporal Graph Physics-Informed Neural Network framework. TG-PhyNN leverages the power of GNNs for graph-based modeling while simultaneously incorporating physical constraints as a guiding principle during training. This is achieved through a two-step prediction strategy that enables the calculation of physical equation derivatives within the GNN architecture. Our findings demonstrate that TG-PhyNN significantly outperforms traditional forecasting models (e.g., GRU, LSTM, GAT) on real-world spatio-temporal datasets like PedalMe (traffic flow), COVID-19 spread, and Chickenpox outbreaks. These datasets are all governed by well-defined physical principles, which TG-PhyNN effectively exploits to offer more reliable and accurate forecasts in various domains where physical processes govern the dynamics of data. This paves the way for improved forecasting in areas like traffic flow prediction, disease outbreak prediction, and potentially other fields where physics plays a crucial role.</description>

      <title>TempoKGAT: A Novel Graph Attention Network Approach for Temporal Graph Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNN) have shown significant capabilities in handling structured data, yet their application to dynamic, temporal data remains limited. This paper presents a new type of graph attention network, called TempoKGAT, which combines time-decaying weight and a selective neighbor aggregation mechanism on the spatial domain, which helps uncover latent patterns in the graph data. In this approach, a top-k neighbor selection based on the edge weights is introduced to represent the evolving features of the graph data. We evaluated the performance of our TempoKGAT on multiple datasets from the traffic, energy, and health sectors involving spatio-temporal data. We compared the performance of our approach to several state-of-the-art methods found in the literature on several open-source datasets. Our method shows superior accuracy on all datasets. These results indicate that TempoKGAT builds on existing methodologies to optimize prediction accuracy and provide new insights into model interpretation in temporal contexts.</description>

      <title>Illuminating the Diversity-Fitness Trade-Off in Black-Box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world applications, users often favor structurally diverse design choices over one high-quality solution. It is hence important to consider more solutions that decision-makers can compare and further explore based on additional criteria. Alongside the existing approaches of evolutionary diversity optimization, quality diversity, and multimodal optimization, this paper presents a fresh perspective on this challenge by considering the problem of identifying a fixed number of solutions with a pairwise distance above a specified threshold while maximizing their average quality.
  We obtain first insight into these objectives by performing a subset selection on the search trajectories of different well-established search heuristics, whether specifically designed with diversity in mind or not. We emphasize that the main goal of our work is not to present a new algorithm but to look at the problem in a more fundamental and theoretically tractable way by asking the question: What trade-off exists between the minimum distance within batches of solutions and the average quality of their fitness? These insights also provide us with a way of making general claims concerning the properties of optimization problems that shall be useful in turn for benchmarking algorithms of the approaches enumerated above.
  A possibly surprising outcome of our empirical study is the observation that naive uniform random sampling establishes a very strong baseline for our problem, hardly ever outperformed by the search trajectories of the considered heuristics. We interpret these results as a motivation to develop algorithms tailored to produce diverse solutions of high average quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential propagation of chaos (SPoC) is a recently developed tool to solve mean-field stochastic differential equations and their related nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations. Based on the theory of SPoC, we present a new method (deepSPoC) that combines the interacting particle system of SPoC and deep learning. Under the framework of deepSPoC, two classes of frequently used deep models include fully connected neural networks and normalizing flows are considered. For high-dimensional problems, spatial adaptive method are designed to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of deepSPoC. We analysis the convergence of the framework of deepSPoC under some simplified conditions and also provide a posterior error estimation for the algorithm. Finally, we test our methods on a wide range of different types of mean-field equations.</description>

      <title>Fourier Spectral Physics Informed Neural Network: An Efficient and Low-Memory PINN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With growing investigations into solving partial differential equations by physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), more accurate and efficient PINNs are required to meet the practical demands of scientific computing. One bottleneck of current PINNs is computing the high-order derivatives via automatic differentiation which often necessitates substantial computing resources. In this paper, we focus on removing the automatic differentiation of the spatial derivatives and propose a spectral-based neural network that substitutes the differential operator with a multiplication. Compared to the PINNs, our approach requires lower memory and shorter training time. Thanks to the exponential convergence of the spectral basis, our approach is more accurate. Moreover, to handle the different situations between physics domain and spectral domain, we provide two strategies to train networks by their spectral information. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, We validate the aforementioned merits of our proposed network.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Hyperparameter Tuning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study emphasizes the challenge of finding the optimal trade-off between bias and variance, especially as hyperparameter optimization increases in complexity. Through empirical analysis, three hyperparameter tuning algorithms Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE), Genetic Search, and Random Search are evaluated across regression and classification tasks. The results show that nonlinear models, with properly tuned hyperparameters, significantly outperform linear models. Interestingly, Random Search excelled in regression tasks, while TPE was more effective for classification tasks. This suggests that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, as different algorithms perform better depending on the task and model type. The findings underscore the importance of selecting the appropriate tuning method and highlight the computational challenges involved in optimizing machine learning models, particularly as search spaces expand.</description>

      <title>Gradient-free variational learning with conditional mixture networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balancing computational efficiency with robust predictive performance is crucial in supervised learning, especially for critical applications. Standard deep learning models, while accurate and scalable, often lack probabilistic features like calibrated predictions and uncertainty quantification. Bayesian methods address these issues but can be computationally expensive as model and data complexity increase. Previous work shows that fast variational methods can reduce the compute requirements of Bayesian methods by eliminating the need for gradient computation or sampling, but are often limited to simple models. We demonstrate that conditional mixture networks (CMNs), a probabilistic variant of the mixture-of-experts (MoE) model, are suitable for fast, gradient-free inference and can solve complex classification tasks. CMNs employ linear experts and a softmax gating network. By exploiting conditional conjugacy and P\'olya-Gamma augmentation, we furnish Gaussian likelihoods for the weights of both the linear experts and the gating network. This enables efficient variational updates using coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI), avoiding traditional gradient-based optimization. We validate this approach by training two-layer CMNs on standard benchmarks from the UCI repository. Our method, CAVI-CMN, achieves competitive and often superior predictive accuracy compared to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with backpropagation, while maintaining competitive runtime and full posterior distributions over all model parameters. Moreover, as input size or the number of experts increases, computation time scales competitively with MLE and other gradient-based solutions like black-box variational inference (BBVI), making CAVI-CMN a promising tool for deep, fast, and gradient-free Bayesian networks.</description>

      <title>HYGENE: A Diffusion-based Hypergraph Generation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are powerful mathematical structures that can model complex, high-order relationships in various domains, including social networks, bioinformatics, and recommender systems. However, generating realistic and diverse hypergraphs remains challenging due to their inherent complexity and lack of effective generative models. In this paper, we introduce a diffusion-based Hypergraph Generation (HYGENE) method that addresses these challenges through a progressive local expansion approach. HYGENE works on the bipartite representation of hypergraphs, starting with a single pair of connected nodes and iteratively expanding it to form the target hypergraph. At each step, nodes and hyperedges are added in a localized manner using a denoising diffusion process, which allows for the construction of the global structure before refining local details. Our experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of HYGENE, proving its ability to closely mimic a variety of properties in hypergraphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to employ deep learning models for hypergraph generation, and our work aims to lay the groundwork for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>An Exploratory Deep Learning Approach for Predicting Subsequent Suicidal Acts in Chinese Psychological Support Hotlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Psychological support hotlines are an effective suicide prevention measure that typically relies on professionals using suicide risk assessment scales to predict individual risk scores. However, the accuracy of scale-based predictive methods for suicide risk assessment can vary widely depending on the expertise of the operator. This limitation underscores the need for more reliable methods, prompting this research's innovative exploration of the use of artificial intelligence to improve the accuracy and efficiency of suicide risk prediction within the context of psychological support hotlines. The study included data from 1,549 subjects from 2015-2017 in China who contacted a psychological support hotline. Each participant was followed for 12 months to identify instances of suicidal behavior. We proposed a novel multi-task learning method that uses the large-scale pre-trained model Whisper for feature extraction and fits psychological scales while predicting the risk of suicide. The proposed method yields a 2.4\% points improvement in F1-score compared to the traditional manual approach based on the psychological scales. Our model demonstrated superior performance compared to the other eight popular models. To our knowledge, this study is the first to apply deep learning to long-term speech data to predict suicide risk in China, indicating grate potential for clinical applications.

      <description>arXiv:2408.16495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for time-series in pervasive computing keep getting larger and more complicated. The Transformer model is by far the most compelling of these AI models. However, it is difficult to obtain the desired performance when deploying such a massive model on a sensor device with limited resources. My research focuses on optimizing the Transformer model for time-series forecasting tasks. The optimized model will be deployed as hardware accelerators on embedded Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). I will investigate the impact of applying Quantization-aware Training to the Transformer model to reduce its size and runtime memory footprint while maximizing the advantages of FPGAs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational continual learning (VCL) is a turn-key learning algorithm that has state-of-the-art performance among the best continual learning models. In our work, we explore an extension of the generalized variational continual learning (GVCL) model, named AutoVCL, which combines task heuristics for informed learning and model optimization. We demonstrate that our model outperforms the standard GVCL with fixed hyperparameters, benefiting from the automatic adjustment of the hyperparameter based on the difficulty and similarity of the incoming task compared to the previous tasks.</description>

      <title>Multitask learning for improved scour detection: A dynamic wave tank study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Population-based structural health monitoring (PBSHM), aims to share information between members of a population. An offshore wind (OW) farm could be considered as a population of nominally-identical wind-turbine structures. However, benign variations exist among members, such as geometry, sea-bed conditions and temperature differences. These factors could influence structural properties and therefore the dynamic response, making it more difficult to detect structural problems via traditional SHM techniques.
  This paper explores the use of a Bayesian hierarchical model as a means of multitask learning, to infer foundation stiffness distribution parameters at both population and local levels. To do this, observations of natural frequency from populations of structures were first generated from both numerical and experimental models. These observations were then used in a partially-pooled Bayesian hierarchical model in tandem with surrogate FE models of the structures to infer foundation stiffness parameters. Finally, it is demonstrated how the learned parameters may be used as a basis to perform more robust anomaly detection (as compared to a no-pooling approach) e.g. as a result of scour.</description>

      <title>TinyTNAS: GPU-Free, Time-Bound, Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search for TinyML Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present TinyTNAS, a novel hardware-aware multi-objective Neural Architecture Search (NAS) tool specifically designed for TinyML time series classification. Unlike traditional NAS methods that rely on GPU capabilities, TinyTNAS operates efficiently on CPUs, making it accessible for a broader range of applications. Users can define constraints on RAM, FLASH, and MAC operations to discover optimal neural network architectures within these parameters. Additionally, the tool allows for time-bound searches, ensuring the best possible model is found within a user-specified duration. By experimenting with benchmark dataset UCI HAR, PAMAP2, WISDM, MIT BIH, and PTB Diagnostic ECG Databas TinyTNAS demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy with significant reductions in RAM, FLASH, MAC usage, and latency. For example, on the UCI HAR dataset, TinyTNAS achieves a 12x reduction in RAM usage, a 144x reduction in MAC operations, and a 78x reduction in FLASH memory while maintaining superior accuracy and reducing latency by 149x. Similarly, on the PAMAP2 and WISDM datasets, it achieves a 6x reduction in RAM usage, a 40x reduction in MAC operations, an 83x reduction in FLASH, and a 67x reduction in latency, all while maintaining superior accuracy. Notably, the search process completes within 10 minutes in a CPU environment. These results highlight TinyTNAS's capability to optimize neural network architectures effectively for resource-constrained TinyML applications, ensuring both efficiency and high performance. The code for TinyTNAS is available at the GitHub repository and can be accessed at https://github.com/BidyutSaha/TinyTNAS.git.</description>

      <title>SFR-GNN: Simple and Fast Robust GNNs against Structural Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated commendable performance for graph-structured data. Yet, GNNs are often vulnerable to adversarial structural attacks as embedding generation relies on graph topology. Existing efforts are dedicated to purifying the maliciously modified structure or applying adaptive aggregation, thereby enhancing the robustness against adversarial structural attacks. It is inevitable for a defender to consume heavy computational costs due to lacking prior knowledge about modified structures. To this end, we propose an efficient defense method, called Simple and Fast Robust Graph Neural Network (SFR-GNN), supported by mutual information theory. The SFR-GNN first pre-trains a GNN model using node attributes and then fine-tunes it over the modified graph in the manner of contrastive learning, which is free of purifying modified structures and adaptive aggregation, thus achieving great efficiency gains. Consequently, SFR-GNN exhibits a 24%--162% speedup compared to advanced robust models, demonstrating superior robustness for node classification tasks.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Latent Factorization of Tensors Model for Embedding Dynamic Communication Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dynamic Communication Network (DCN) describes the interactions over time among various communication nodes, and it is widely used in Big-data applications as a data source. As the number of communication nodes increases and temporal slots accumulate, each node interacts in with only a few nodes in a given temporal slot, the DCN can be represented by an High-Dimensional Sparse (HDS) tensor. In order to extract rich behavioral patterns from an HDS tensor in DCN, this paper proposes an Adaptive Temporal-dependent Tensor low-rank representation (ATT) model. It adopts a three-fold approach: a) designing a temporal-dependent method to reconstruct temporal feature matrix, thereby precisely represent the data by capturing the temporal patterns; b) achieving hyper-parameters adaptation of the model via the Differential Evolutionary Algorithms (DEA) to avoid tedious hyper-parameters tuning; c) employing nonnegative learning schemes for the model parameters to effectively handle an the nonnegativity inherent in HDS data. The experimental results on four real-world DCNs demonstrate that the proposed ATT model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art models in both prediction errors and convergence rounds.</description>

      <title>Seeking the Sufficiency and Necessity Causal Features in Multimodal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning representations with a high Probability of Necessary and Sufficient Causes (PNS) has been shown to enhance deep learning models' ability. This task involves identifying causal features that are both sufficient (guaranteeing the outcome) and necessary (without which the outcome cannot occur). However, current research predominantly focuses on unimodal data, and extending PNS learning to multimodal settings presents significant challenges. The challenges arise as the conditions for PNS identifiability, Exogeneity and Monotonicity, need to be reconsidered in a multimodal context, where sufficient and necessary causal features are distributed across different modalities. To address this, we first propose conceptualizing multimodal representations as comprising modality-invariant and modality-specific components. We then analyze PNS identifiability for each component, while ensuring non-trivial PNS estimation. Finally, we formulate tractable optimization objectives that enable multimodal models to learn high-PNS representations, thereby enhancing their predictive performance. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that carefully adjusting the tokenizer of the Whisper speech recognition model significantly improves the precision of word-level timestamps when applying dynamic time warping to the decoder's cross-attention scores. We fine-tune the model to produce more verbatim speech transcriptions and employ several techniques to increase robustness against multiple speakers and background noise. These adjustments achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks for verbatim speech transcription, word segmentation, and the timed detection of filler events, and can further mitigate transcription hallucinations.

      <title>High-Dimensional Sparse Data Low-rank Representation via Accelerated Asynchronous Parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data characterized by high dimensionality and sparsity are commonly used to describe real-world node interactions. Low-rank representation (LR) can map high-dimensional sparse (HDS) data to low-dimensional feature spaces and infer node interactions via modeling data latent associations. Unfortunately, existing optimization algorithms for LR models are computationally inefficient and slowly convergent on large-scale datasets. To address this issue, this paper proposes an Accelerated Asynchronous Parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent A2PSGD for High-Dimensional Sparse Data Low-rank Representation with three fold-ideas: a) establishing a lock-free scheduler to simultaneously respond to scheduling requests from multiple threads; b) introducing a greedy algorithm-based load balancing strategy for balancing the computational load among threads; c) incorporating Nesterov's accelerated gradient into the learning scheme to accelerate model convergence. Empirical studies show that A2PSGD outperforms existing optimization algorithms for HDS data LR in both accuracy and training time.</description>

      <title>sEMG-Driven Physics-Informed Gated Recurrent Networks for Modeling Upper Limb Multi-Joint Movement Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoskeletons and rehabilitation systems offer great potential for enhancing human strength and recovery through advanced human-machine interfaces (HMIs) that adapt to movement dynamics. However, the real-time application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is limited by their reliance on fixed input lengths and surrogate models. This study introduces a novel physics-informed Gated Recurrent Network (PiGRN) designed to predict multi-joint torques using surface electromyography (sEMG) data. The PiGRN model employs a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to convert time-series sEMG inputs into multi-joint kinematics and external loads, which are then integrated into an equation of motion to ensure consistency with physical laws. Experimental validation with sEMG data from five participants performing elbow flexion-extension tasks showed that the PiGRN model accurately predicted joint torques for 10 unfamiliar movements, with RMSE values between 4.02\% and 11.40\% and correlation coefficients ranging from 0.87 to 0.98. These findings highlight the PiGRN's potential for real-time exoskeleton and rehabilitation applications. Future research will explore more diverse datasets, improve musculoskeletal models, and investigate unsupervised learning methods.</description>

      <title>Data Quality Monitoring through Transfer Learning on Anomaly Detection for the Hadron Calorimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of sensors brings an immense volume of spatio-temporal (ST) data in many domains for various purposes, including monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics applications. Data curation is a time-consuming process for a large volume of data, making it challenging and expensive to deploy data analytics platforms in new environments. Transfer learning (TL) mechanisms promise to mitigate data sparsity and model complexity by utilizing pre-trained models for a new task. Despite the triumph of TL in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, efforts on complex ST models for anomaly detection (AD) applications are limited. In this study, we present the potential of TL within the context of AD for the Hadron Calorimeter of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at CERN. We have transferred the ST AD models trained on data collected from one part of a calorimeter to another. We have investigated different configurations of TL on semi-supervised autoencoders of the ST AD models -- transferring convolutional, graph, and recurrent neural networks of both the encoder and decoder networks. The experiment results demonstrate that TL effectively enhances the model learning accuracy on a target subdetector. The TL achieves promising data reconstruction and AD performance while substantially reducing the trainable parameters of the AD models. It also improves robustness against anomaly contamination in the training data sets of the semi-supervised AD models.</description>

      <title>Blending Low and High-Level Semantics of Time Series for Better Masked Time Series Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches in time series generation (TSG), such as TimeVQVAE, utilize vector quantization-based tokenization to effectively model complex distributions of time series. These approaches first learn to transform time series into a sequence of discrete latent vectors, and then a prior model is learned to model the sequence. The discrete latent vectors, however, only capture low-level semantics (\textit{e.g.,} shapes). We hypothesize that higher-fidelity time series can be generated by training a prior model on more informative discrete latent vectors that contain both low and high-level semantics (\textit{e.g.,} characteristic dynamics). In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, termed NC-VQVAE, to integrate self-supervised learning into those TSG methods to derive a discrete latent space where low and high-level semantics are captured. Our experimental results demonstrate that NC-VQVAE results in a considerable improvement in the quality of synthetic samples.</description>

      <title>Hyperdimensional Vector Tsetlin Machines with Applications to Sequence Learning and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a two-layered model for learning and generating sequential data that is both computationally fast and competitive with vanilla Tsetlin machines, adding numerous advantages. Through the use of hyperdimensional vector computing (HVC) algebras and Tsetlin machine clause structures, we demonstrate that the combination of both inherits the generality of data encoding and decoding of HVC with the fast interpretable nature of Tsetlin machines to yield a powerful machine learning model. We apply the approach in two areas, namely in forecasting, generating new sequences, and classification. For the latter, we derive results for the entire UCR Time Series Archive and compare with the standard benchmarks to see how well the method competes in time series classification.</description>

      <title>Optimal Parallelization of Boosting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works on the parallel complexity of Boosting have established strong lower bounds on the tradeoff between the number of training rounds $p$ and the total parallel work per round $t$. These works have also presented highly non-trivial parallel algorithms that shed light on different regions of this tradeoff. Despite these advancements, a significant gap persists between the theoretical lower bounds and the performance of these algorithms across much of the tradeoff space. In this work, we essentially close this gap by providing both improved lower bounds on the parallel complexity of weak-to-strong learners, and a parallel Boosting algorithm whose performance matches these bounds across the entire $p$ vs.~$t$ compromise spectrum, up to logarithmic factors. Ultimately, this work settles the true parallel complexity of Boosting algorithms that are nearly sample-optimal.</description>

      <title>Iterative Graph Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By compressing diverse narratives, LLMs go beyond memorization, achieving intelligence by capturing generalizable causal relationships. However, they suffer from local 'representation gaps' due to insufficient training data diversity, limiting their real-world utility, especially in tasks requiring strict alignment to rules. Traditional alignment methods relying on heavy human annotations are inefficient and unscalable. Recent self-alignment techniques also fall short, as they often depend on self-selection based prompting and memorization-based learning. To address these issues, we introduce Iterative Graph Alignment (IGA), an annotation-free rule-based alignment algorithm. A teacher model (VLM) employs Iterative Graph Prompting (IGP) to create logical graphs and reference answers. The student model (LLM) identifies local knowledge gaps by attempting to align its responses with these references, collaborating with helper models to generate diverse answers. These aligned responses are then used for iterative supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our evaluations across five rule-based scenarios demonstrate IGP's effectiveness, with a 73.12\% alignment improvement in Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Llama3-8B-Instruct achieving an 86.20\% improvement, outperforming Claude Sonnet 3.5 in rule-based alignment.</description>

      <title>Entropic Distribution Matching in Supervised Fine-tuning of LLMs: Less Overfitting and Better Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to specialize in downstream tasks. Cross Entropy (CE) loss is the de facto choice in SFT, but it often leads to overfitting and limited output diversity due to its aggressive updates to the data distribution. This paper aim to address these issues by introducing the maximum entropy principle, which favors models with flatter distributions that still effectively capture the data. Specifically, we develop a new distribution matching method called GEM, which solves reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization with an entropy regularizer.
  For the SFT of Llama-3-8B models, GEM outperforms CE in several aspects. First, when applied to the UltraFeedback dataset to develop general instruction-following abilities, GEM exhibits reduced overfitting, evidenced by lower perplexity and better performance on the IFEval benchmark. Furthermore, GEM enhances output diversity, leading to performance gains of up to 7 points on math reasoning and code generation tasks using best-of-n sampling, even without domain-specific data. Second, when fine-tuning with domain-specific datasets for math reasoning and code generation, GEM also shows less overfitting and improvements of up to 10 points compared with CE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for learning on CW-complex structured data points. Recent advances have discussed CW-complexes as ideal learning representations for problems in cheminformatics. However, there is a lack of available machine learning methods suitable for learning on CW-complexes. In this paper we develop notions of convolution and attention that are well defined for CW-complexes. These notions enable us to create the first neural network that can receive a CW-complex as input. We illustrate and interpret this framework in the context of supervised prediction.</description>

      <title>SympGNNs: Symplectic Graph Neural Networks for identifiying high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems and node classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing neural network models to learn Hamiltonian systems, such as SympNets, although accurate in low-dimensions, struggle to learn the correct dynamics for high-dimensional many-body systems. Herein, we introduce Symplectic Graph Neural Networks (SympGNNs) that can effectively handle system identification in high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems, as well as node classification. SympGNNs combines symplectic maps with permutation equivariance, a property of graph neural networks. Specifically, we propose two variants of SympGNNs: i) G-SympGNN and ii) LA-SympGNN, arising from different parameterizations of the kinetic and potential energy. We demonstrate the capabilities of SympGNN on two physical examples: a 40-particle coupled Harmonic oscillator, and a 2000-particle molecular dynamics simulation in a two-dimensional Lennard-Jones potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance of SympGNN in the node classification task, achieving accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art. We also empirically show that SympGNN can overcome the oversmoothing and heterophily problems, two key challenges in the field of graph neural networks.</description>

      <title>Enhanced forecasting of stock prices based on variational mode decomposition, PatchTST, and adaptive scale-weighted layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The significant fluctuations in stock index prices in recent years highlight the critical need for accurate forecasting to guide investment and financial strategies. This study introduces a novel composite forecasting framework that integrates variational mode decomposition (VMD), PatchTST, and adaptive scale-weighted layer (ASWL) to address these challenges. Utilizing datasets of four major stock indices--SP500, DJI, SSEC, and FTSE--from 2000 to 2024, the proposed method first decomposes the raw price series into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using VMD. Each IMF is then modeled with PatchTST to capture temporal patterns effectively. The ASWL module is applied to incorporate scale information, enhancing prediction accuracy. The final forecast is derived by aggregating predictions from all IMFs. The VMD-PatchTST-ASWL framework demonstrates significant improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to traditional models, showing robust performance across different indices. This innovative approach provides a powerful tool for stock index price forecasting, with potential applications in various financial analysis and investment decision-making contexts.</description>

      <title>A GREAT Architecture for Edge-Based Graph Problems Like TSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last years, many neural network-based approaches have been proposed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems such as routing problems. Many of these approaches are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) or related transformers, operating on the Euclidean coordinates representing the routing problems. However, GNNs are inherently not well suited to operate on dense graphs, such as in routing problems. Furthermore, models operating on Euclidean coordinates cannot be applied to non-Euclidean versions of routing problems that are often found in real-world settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel GNN-related edge-based neural model called Graph Edge Attention Network (GREAT). We evaluate the performance of GREAT in the edge-classification task to predict optimal edges in the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We can use such a trained GREAT model to produce sparse TSP graph instances, keeping only the edges GREAT finds promising. Compared to other, non-learning-based methods to sparsify TSP graphs, GREAT can produce very sparse graphs while keeping most of the optimal edges. Furthermore, we build a reinforcement learning-based GREAT framework which we apply to Euclidean and non-Euclidean asymmetric TSP. This framework achieves state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>A Score-Based Density Formula, with Applications in Diffusion Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) have revolutionized the field of generative modeling, achieving unprecedented success in generating realistic and diverse content. Despite empirical advances, the theoretical basis for why optimizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on the log-likelihood is effective for training diffusion generative models, such as DDPMs, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we address this question by establishing a density formula for a continuous-time diffusion process, which can be viewed as the continuous-time limit of the forward process in an SGM. This formula reveals the connection between the target density and the score function associated with each step of the forward process. Building on this, we demonstrate that the minimizer of the optimization objective for training DDPMs nearly coincides with that of the true objective, providing a theoretical foundation for optimizing DDPMs using the ELBO. Furthermore, we offer new insights into the role of score-matching regularization in training GANs, the use of ELBO in diffusion classifiers, and the recently proposed diffusion loss.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Publication of Electricity Time Series Data in Smart Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart grids are a valuable data source to study consumer behavior and guide energy policy decisions. In particular, time-series of power consumption over geographical areas are essential in deciding the optimal placement of expensive resources (e.g., transformers, storage elements) and their activation schedules. However, publication of such data raises significant privacy issues, as it may reveal sensitive details about personal habits and lifestyles. Differential privacy (DP) is well-suited for sanitization of individual data, but current DP techniques for time series lead to significant loss in utility, due to the existence of temporal correlation between data readings. We introduce {\em STPT (Spatio-Temporal Private Timeseries)}, a novel method for DP-compliant publication of electricity consumption data that analyzes spatio-temporal attributes and captures both micro and macro patterns by leveraging RNNs. Additionally, it employs a partitioning method for releasing electricity consumption time series based on identified patterns. We demonstrate through extensive experiments, on both real-world and synthetic datasets, that STPT significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, providing a well-balanced trade-off between data utility and user privacy.</description>

      <title>SPICED: Syntactical Bug and Trojan Pattern Identification in A/MS Circuits using LLM-Enhanced Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog and mixed-signal (A/MS) integrated circuits (ICs) are crucial in modern electronics, playing key roles in signal processing, amplification, sensing, and power management. Many IC companies outsource manufacturing to third-party foundries, creating security risks such as stealthy analog Trojans. Traditional detection methods, including embedding circuit watermarks or conducting hardware-based monitoring, often impose significant area and power overheads, and may not effectively identify all types of Trojans. To address these shortcomings, we propose SPICED, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework that operates within the software domain, eliminating the need for hardware modifications for Trojan detection and localization. This is the first work using LLM-aided techniques for detecting and localizing syntactical bugs and analog Trojans in circuit netlists, requiring no explicit training and incurring zero area overhead. Our framework employs chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot examples to teach anomaly detection rules to LLMs. With the proposed method, we achieve an average Trojan coverage of 93.32% and an average true positive rate of 93.4% in identifying Trojan-impacted nodes for the evaluated analog benchmark circuits. These experimental results validate the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting and locating both syntactical bugs and Trojans within analog netlists.</description>

      <title>XG-NID: Dual-Modality Network Intrusion Detection using a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network and Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity, the integration of flow-level and packet-level information for real-time intrusion detection remains a largely untapped area of research. This paper introduces "XG-NID," a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to fuse flow-level and packet-level data within a heterogeneous graph structure, offering a comprehensive analysis of network traffic. Leveraging a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) with graph-level classification, XG-NID uniquely enables real-time inference while effectively capturing the intricate relationships between flow and packet payload data. Unlike traditional GNN-based methodologies that predominantly analyze historical data, XG-NID is designed to accommodate the heterogeneous nature of network traffic, providing a robust and real-time defense mechanism. Our framework extends beyond mere classification; it integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate detailed, human-readable explanations and suggest potential remedial actions, ensuring that the insights produced are both actionable and comprehensible. Additionally, we introduce a new set of flow features based on temporal information, further enhancing the contextual and explainable inferences provided by our model. To facilitate practical application and accessibility, we developed "GNN4ID," an open-source tool that enables the extraction and transformation of raw network traffic into the proposed heterogeneous graph structure, seamlessly integrating flow and packet-level data. Our comprehensive quantitative comparative analysis demonstrates that XG-NID achieves an F1 score of 97\% in multi-class classification, outperforming existing baseline and state-of-the-art methods. This sets a new standard in Network Intrusion Detection Systems by combining innovative data fusion with enhanced interpretability and real-time capabilities.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Physician Referral Networks with Ricci Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying (a) systemic barriers to quality healthcare access and (b) key indicators of care efficacy in the United States remains a significant challenge. To improve our understanding of regional disparities in care delivery, we introduce a novel application of curvature, a geometrical-topological property of networks, to Physician Referral Networks. Our initial findings reveal that Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci curvature measures, which are known for their expressive power in characterizing network structure, offer promising indicators for detecting variations in healthcare efficacy while capturing a range of significant regional demographic features. We also present APPARENT, an open-source tool that leverages Ricci curvature and other network features to examine correlations between regional Physician Referral Networks structure, local census data, healthcare effectiveness, and patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Improving Adversarial Robustness in Android Malware Detection by Reducing the Impact of Spurious Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated significant advancements in Android malware detection (AMD); however, the resilience of ML against realistic evasion attacks remains a major obstacle for AMD. One of the primary factors contributing to this challenge is the scarcity of reliable generalizations. Malware classifiers with limited generalizability tend to overfit spurious correlations derived from biased features. Consequently, adversarial examples (AEs), generated by evasion attacks, can modify these features to evade detection. In this study, we propose a domain adaptation technique to improve the generalizability of AMD by aligning the distribution of malware samples and AEs. Specifically, we utilize meaningful feature dependencies, reflecting domain constraints in the feature space, to establish a robust feature space. Training on the proposed robust feature space enables malware classifiers to learn from predefined patterns associated with app functionality rather than from individual features. This approach helps mitigate spurious correlations inherent in the initial feature space. Our experiments conducted on DREBIN, a renowned Android malware detector, demonstrate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art defense, Sec-SVM, when facing realistic evasion attacks. In particular, our defense can improve adversarial robustness by up to 55% against realistic evasion attacks compared to Sec-SVM.</description>

      <title>ANVIL: Anomaly-based Vulnerability Identification without Labelled Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervised learning-based software vulnerability detectors often fall short due to the inadequate availability of labelled training data. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, are not trained on labelled data, but when prompted to detect vulnerabilities, LLM prediction accuracy is only marginally better than random guessing. In this paper, we explore a different approach by reframing vulnerability detection as one of anomaly detection. Since the vast majority of code does not contain vulnerabilities and LLMs are trained on massive amounts of such code, vulnerable code can be viewed as an anomaly from the LLM's predicted code distribution, freeing the model from the need for labelled data to provide a learnable representation of vulnerable code. Leveraging this perspective, we demonstrate that LLMs trained for code generation exhibit a significant gap in prediction accuracy when prompted to reconstruct vulnerable versus non-vulnerable code.
  Using this insight, we implement ANVIL, a detector that identifies software vulnerabilities at line-level granularity. Our experiments explore the discriminating power of different anomaly scoring methods, as well as the sensitivity of ANVIL to context size. We also study the effectiveness of ANVIL on various LLM families, and conduct leakage experiments on vulnerabilities that were discovered after the knowledge cutoff of our evaluated LLMs. On a collection of vulnerabilities from the Magma benchmark, ANVIL outperforms state-of-the-art line-level vulnerability detectors, LineVul and LineVD, which have been trained with labelled data, despite ANVIL having never been trained with labelled vulnerabilities. Specifically, our approach achieves $1.62\times$ to $2.18\times$ better Top-5 accuracies and $1.02\times$ to $1.29\times$ times better ROC scores on line-level vulnerability detection tasks.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Approach to Localizing Multi-level Airway Collapse Based on Snoring Sounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of machine/deep learning to classify snoring sounds excited at different levels of the upper airway in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) using data from drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE). The snoring sounds of 39 subjects were analyzed and labeled according to the Velum, Oropharynx, Tongue Base, and Epiglottis (VOTE) classification system. The dataset, comprising 5,173 one-second segments, was used to train and test models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and ResNet-50. The ResNet-50, a convolutional neural network (CNN), showed the best overall performance in classifying snoring acoustics, particularly in identifying multi-level obstructions. The study emphasizes the potential of integrating snoring acoustics with deep learning to improve the diagnosis and treatment of OSA. However, challenges such as limited sample size, data imbalance, and differences between pharmacologically induced and natural snoring sounds were noted, suggesting further research to enhance model accuracy and generalizability.</description>

      <title>Systematic Evaluation of Synthetic Data Augmentation for Multi-class NetFlow Traffic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of cyber-attacks in computer networks is a crucial and ongoing research challenge. Machine learning-based attack classification offers a promising solution, as these models can be continuously updated with new data, enhancing the effectiveness of network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Unlike binary classification models that simply indicate the presence of an attack, multi-class models can identify specific types of attacks, allowing for more targeted and effective incident responses. However, a significant drawback of these classification models is their sensitivity to imbalanced training data. Recent advances suggest that generative models can assist in data augmentation, claiming to offer superior solutions for imbalanced datasets. Classical balancing methods, although less novel, also provide potential remedies for this issue. Despite these claims, a comprehensive comparison of these methods within the NIDS domain is lacking. Most existing studies focus narrowly on individual methods, making it difficult to compare results due to varying experimental setups. To close this gap, we designed a systematic framework to compare classical and generative resampling methods for class balancing across multiple popular classification models in the NIDS domain, evaluated on several NIDS benchmark datasets. Our experiments indicate that resampling methods for balancing training data do not reliably improve classification performance. Although some instances show performance improvements, the majority of results indicate decreased performance, with no consistent trend in favor of a specific resampling technique enhancing a particular classifier.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Diagnostics (Part II): Prevalence, Linear Independence, and Unsupervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second manuscript in a two-part series that uses diagnostic testing to understand the connection between prevalence (i.e. number of elements in a class), uncertainty quantification (UQ), and classification theory. Part I considered the context of supervised machine learning (ML) and established a duality between prevalence and the concept of relative conditional probability. The key idea of that analysis was to train a family of discriminative classifiers by minimizing a sum of prevalence-weighted empirical risk functions. The resulting outputs can be interpreted as relative probability level-sets, which thereby yield uncertainty estimates in the class labels. This procedure also demonstrated that certain discriminative and generative ML models are equivalent. Part II considers the extent to which these results can be extended to tasks in unsupervised learning through recourse to ideas in linear algebra. We first observe that the distribution of an impure population, for which the class of a corresponding sample is unknown, can be parameterized in terms of a prevalence. This motivates us to introduce the concept of linearly independent populations, which have different but unknown prevalence values. Using this, we identify an isomorphism between classifiers defined in terms of impure and pure populations. In certain cases, this also leads to a nonlinear system of equations whose solution yields the prevalence values of the linearly independent populations, fully realizing unsupervised learning as a generalization of supervised learning. We illustrate our methods in the context of synthetic data and a research-use-only SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</description>

      <title>Unlocking Global Optimality in Bilevel Optimization: A Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization has witnessed a resurgence of interest, driven by its critical role in trustworthy and efficient machine learning applications. Recent research has focused on proposing efficient methods with provable convergence guarantees. However, while many prior works have established convergence to stationary points or local minima, obtaining the global optimum of bilevel optimization remains an important yet open problem. The difficulty lies in the fact that unlike many prior non-convex single-level problems, this bilevel problem does not admit a ``benign" landscape, and may indeed have multiple spurious local solutions. Nevertheless, attaining the global optimality is indispensable for ensuring reliability, safety, and cost-effectiveness, particularly in high-stakes engineering applications that rely on bilevel optimization. In this paper, we first explore the challenges of establishing a global convergence theory for bilevel optimization, and present two sufficient conditions for global convergence. We provide algorithm-specific proofs to rigorously substantiate these sufficient conditions along the optimization trajectory, focusing on two specific bilevel learning scenarios: representation learning and data hypercleaning (a.k.a. reweighting). Experiments corroborate the theoretical findings, demonstrating convergence to global minimum in both cases.</description>

      <title>A nudge to the truth: atom conservation as a hard constraint in models of atmospheric composition using an uncertainty-weighted correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational models of atmospheric composition are not always physically consistent. For example, not all models respect fundamental conservation laws such as conservation of atoms in an interconnected chemical system. In well performing models, these nonphysical deviations are often ignored because they are frequently minor, and thus only need a small nudge to perfectly conserve mass. Here we introduce a method that anchors a prediction from any numerical model to physically consistent hard constraints, nudging concentrations to the nearest solution that respects the conservation laws. This closed-form model-agnostic correction uses a single matrix operation to minimally perturb the predicted concentrations to ensure that atoms are conserved to machine precision. To demonstrate this approach, we train a gradient boosting decision tree ensemble to emulate a small reference model of ozone photochemistry and test the effect of the correction on accurate but non-conservative predictions. The nudging approach minimally perturbs the already well-predicted results for most species, but decreases the accuracy of important oxidants, including radicals. We develop a weighted extension of this nudging approach that considers the uncertainty and magnitude of each species in the correction. This species-level weighting approach is essential to accurately predict important low concentration species such as radicals. We find that applying the uncertainty-weighted correction to the nonphysical predictions slightly improves overall accuracy, by nudging the predictions to a more likely mass-conserving solution.</description>

      <title>ChartEye: A Deep Learning Framework for Chart Information Extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of charts and infographics as a means of data visualization in various domains has inspired recent research in automated chart understanding. However, information extraction from chart images is a complex multitasked process due to style variations and, as a consequence, it is challenging to design an end-to-end system. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based framework that provides a solution for key steps in the chart information extraction pipeline. The proposed framework utilizes hierarchal vision transformers for the tasks of chart-type and text-role classification, while YOLOv7 for text detection. The detected text is then enhanced using Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks to improve the recognition output of the OCR. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset show that our proposed framework achieves excellent performance at every stage with F1-scores of 0.97 for chart-type classification, 0.91 for text-role classification, and a mean Average Precision of 0.95 for text detection.</description>

Abstract: Achieving robust speech separation for overlapping speakers in various acoustic environments with noise and reverberation remains an open challenge. Although existing datasets are available to train separators for specific scenarios, they do not effectively generalize across diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel data simulation pipeline that produces diverse training data from a range of acoustic environments and content, and propose new training paradigms to improve quality of a general speech separation model. Specifically, we first introduce AC-SIM, a data simulation pipeline that incorporates broad variations in both content and acoustics. Then we integrate multiple training objectives into the permutation invariant training (PIT) to enhance separation quality and generalization of the trained model. Finally, we conduct comprehensive objective and human listening experiments across separation architectures and benchmarks to validate our methods, demonstrating substantial improvement of generalization on both non-homologous and real-world test sets.</description>

      <title>Using Backbone Foundation Model for Evaluating Fairness in Chest Radiography Without Demographic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring consistent performance across diverse populations and incorporating fairness into machine learning models are crucial for advancing medical image diagnostics and promoting equitable healthcare. However, many databases do not provide protected attributes or contain unbalanced representations of demographic groups, complicating the evaluation of model performance across different demographics and the application of bias mitigation techniques that rely on these attributes. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of using the backbone of Foundation Models as an embedding extractor for creating groups that represent protected attributes, such as gender and age. We propose utilizing these groups in different stages of bias mitigation, including pre-processing, in-processing, and evaluation. Using databases in and out-of-distribution scenarios, it is possible to identify that the method can create groups that represent gender in both databases and reduce in 4.44% the difference between the gender attribute in-distribution and 6.16% in out-of-distribution. However, the model lacks robustness in handling age attributes, underscoring the need for more fundamentally fair and robust Foundation models. These findings suggest a role in promoting fairness assessment in scenarios where we lack knowledge of attributes, contributing to the development of more equitable medical diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Does Data-Efficient Generalization Exacerbate Bias in Foundation Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as robust models with label efficiency in diverse domains. In medical imaging, these models contribute to the advancement of medical diagnoses due to the difficulty in obtaining labeled data. However, it is unclear whether using a large amount of unlabeled data, biased by the presence of sensitive attributes during pre-training, influences the fairness of the model. This research examines the bias in the Foundation model (RetFound) when it is applied to fine-tune the Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset (BRSET), which has a different population than the pre-training dataset. The model evaluation, in comparison with supervised learning, shows that the Foundation Model has the potential to reduce the gap between the maximum AUC and minimum AUC evaluations across gender and age groups. However, in a data-efficient generalization, the model increases the bias when the data amount decreases. These findings suggest that when deploying a Foundation Model in real-life scenarios with limited data, the possibility of fairness issues should be considered.</description>

      <title>CardBench: A Benchmark for Learned Cardinality Estimation in Relational Databases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardinality estimation is crucial for enabling high query performance in relational databases. Recently learned cardinality estimation models have been proposed to improve accuracy but there is no systematic benchmark or datasets which allows researchers to evaluate the progress made by new learned approaches and even systematically develop new learned approaches. In this paper, we are releasing a benchmark, containing thousands of queries over 20 distinct real-world databases for learned cardinality estimation. In contrast to other initial benchmarks, our benchmark is much more diverse and can be used for training and testing learned models systematically. Using this benchmark, we explored whether learned cardinality estimation can be transferred to an unseen dataset in a zero-shot manner. We trained GNN-based and transformer-based models to study the problem in three setups: 1-) instance-based, 2-) zero-shot, and 3-) fine-tuned. Our results show that while we get promising results for zero-shot cardinality estimation on simple single table queries; as soon as we add joins, the accuracy drops. However, we show that with fine-tuning, we can still utilize pre-trained models for cardinality estimation, significantly reducing training overheads compared to instance specific models. We are open sourcing our scripts to collect statistics, generate queries and training datasets to foster more extensive research, also from the ML community on the important problem of cardinality estimation and in particular improve on recent directions such as pre-trained cardinality estimation.</description>

      <title>A Minibatch-SGD-Based Learning Meta-Policy for Inventory Systems with Myopic Optimal Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has proven effective in solving many inventory control problems with demand learning. However, it often faces the pitfall of an infeasible target inventory level that is lower than the current inventory level. Several recent works (e.g., Huh and Rusmevichientong (2009), Shi et al.(2016)) are successful to resolve this issue in various inventory systems. However, their techniques are rather sophisticated and difficult to be applied to more complicated scenarios such as multi-product and multi-constraint inventory systems.
  In this paper, we address the infeasible-target-inventory-level issue from a new technical perspective -- we propose a novel minibatch-SGD-based meta-policy. Our meta-policy is flexible enough to be applied to a general inventory systems framework covering a wide range of inventory management problems with myopic clairvoyant optimal policy. By devising the optimal minibatch scheme, our meta-policy achieves a regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ for the general convex case and $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ for the strongly convex case. To demonstrate the power and flexibility of our meta-policy, we apply it to three important inventory control problems: multi-product and multi-constraint systems, multi-echelon serial systems, and one-warehouse and multi-store systems by carefully designing application-specific subroutines.We also conduct extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate that our meta-policy enjoys competitive regret performance, high computational efficiency, and low variances among a wide range of applications.</description>

The main setting of interest is when the objective and constraint functions may be nonlinear and/or nonconvex, and when constraint values and derivatives are tractable to compute, but objective function values and derivatives can only be estimated. The algorithm is intended primarily for a setting that is similar for stochastic-gradient methods for unconstrained optimization, namely, the setting when stochastic-gradient estimates are available and employed in place of gradients of the objective, and when no objective function values (nor estimates of them) are employed. This is achieved by the interior-point framework having a single-loop structure rather than the nested-loop structure that is typical of contemporary interior-point methods. For completeness, convergence guarantees for the framework are provided both for deterministic and stochastic settings. Numerical experiments show that the algorithm yields good performance on a large set of test problems.</description>

      <title>A More Unified Theory of Transfer Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that some basic moduli of continuity $\delta$ -- which measure how fast target risk decreases as source risk decreases -- appear to be at the root of many of the classical relatedness measures in transfer learning and related literature. Namely, bounds in terms of $\delta$ recover many of the existing bounds in terms of other measures of relatedness -- both in regression and classification -- and can at times be tighter.
  We are particularly interested in general situations where the learner has access to both source data and some or no target data. The unified perspective allowed by the moduli $\delta$ allow us to extend many existing notions of relatedness at once to these scenarios involving target data: interestingly, while $\delta$ itself might not be efficiently estimated, adaptive procedures exist -- based on reductions to confidence sets -- which can get nearly tight rates in terms of $\delta$ with no prior distributional knowledge. Such adaptivity to unknown $\delta$ immediately implies adaptivity to many classical relatedness notions, in terms of combined source and target samples' sizes.</description>

      <title>Uni-3DAD: GAN-Inversion Aided Universal 3D Anomaly Detection on Model-free Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection is a long-standing challenge in manufacturing systems. Traditionally, anomaly detection has relied on human inspectors. However, 3D point clouds have gained attention due to their robustness to environmental factors and their ability to represent geometric data. Existing 3D anomaly detection methods generally fall into two categories. One compares scanned 3D point clouds with design files, assuming these files are always available. However, such assumptions are often violated in many real-world applications where model-free products exist, such as fresh produce (i.e., ``Cookie", ``Potato", etc.), dentures, bone, etc. The other category compares patches of scanned 3D point clouds with a library of normal patches named memory bank. However, those methods usually fail to detect incomplete shapes, which is a fairly common defect type (i.e., missing pieces of different products). The main challenge is that missing areas in 3D point clouds represent the absence of scanned points. This makes it infeasible to compare the missing region with existing point cloud patches in the memory bank. To address these two challenges, we proposed a unified, unsupervised 3D anomaly detection framework capable of identifying all types of defects on model-free products. Our method integrates two detection modules: a feature-based detection module and a reconstruction-based detection module. Feature-based detection covers geometric defects, such as dents, holes, and cracks, while the reconstruction-based method detects missing regions. Additionally, we employ a One-class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) to fuse the detection results from both modules. The results demonstrate that (1) our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in identifying incomplete shapes and (2) it still maintains comparable performance with the SOTA methods in detecting all other types of anomalies.</description>

      <title>The Application of Machine Learning in Tidal Evolution Simulation of Star-Planet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the release of a large amount of astronomical data, an increasing number of close-in hot Jupiters have been discovered. Calculating their evolutionary curves using star-planet interaction models presents a challenge. To expedite the generation of evolutionary curves for these close-in hot Jupiter systems, we utilized tidal interaction models established on MESA to create 15,745 samples of star-planet systems and 7,500 samples of stars. Additionally, we employed a neural network (Multi-Layer Perceptron - MLP) to predict the evolutionary curves of the systems, including stellar effective temperature, radius, stellar rotation period, and planetary orbital period. The median relative errors of the predicted evolutionary curves were found to be 0.15%, 0.43%, 2.61%, and 0.57%, respectively. Furthermore, the speed at which we generate evolutionary curves exceeds that of model-generated curves by more than four orders of magnitude. We also extracted features of planetary migration states and utilized lightGBM to classify the samples into 6 categories for prediction. We found that by combining three types that undergo long-term double synchronization into one label, the classifier effectively recognized these features. Apart from systems experiencing long-term double synchronization, the median relative errors of the predicted evolutionary curves were all below 4%. Our work provides an efficient method to save significant computational resources and time with minimal loss in accuracy. This research also lays the foundation for analyzing the evolutionary characteristics of systems under different migration states, aiding in the understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms of such systems. Finally, to a large extent, our approach could replace the calculations of theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Network Optimization under Bandit Feedback: Maximizing Utility in Non-Stationary Multi-Hop Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Network Optimization (SNO) concerns scheduling in stochastic queueing systems. It has been widely studied in network theory. Classical SNO algorithms require network conditions to be stationary with time, which fails to capture the non-stationary components in many real-world scenarios. Many existing algorithms also assume knowledge of network conditions before decision, which rules out applications where unpredictability presents.
  Motivated by these issues, we consider Adversarial Network Optimization (ANO) under bandit feedback. Specifically, we consider the task of *i)* maximizing some unknown and time-varying utility function associated to scheduler's actions, where *ii)* the underlying network is a non-stationary multi-hop one whose conditions change arbitrarily with time, and *iii)* only bandit feedback (effect of actually deployed actions) is revealed after decisions. Our proposed `UMO2` algorithm ensures network stability and also matches the utility maximization performance of any "mildly varying" reference policy up to a polynomially decaying gap. To our knowledge, no previous ANO algorithm handled multi-hop networks or achieved utility guarantees under bandit feedback, whereas ours can do both.
  Technically, our method builds upon a novel integration of online learning into Lyapunov analyses: To handle complex inter-dependencies among queues in multi-hop networks, we propose meticulous techniques to balance online learning and Lyapunov arguments. To tackle the learning obstacles due to potentially unbounded queue sizes, we design a new online linear optimization algorithm that automatically adapts to loss magnitudes. To maximize utility, we propose a bandit convex optimization algorithm with novel queue-dependent learning rate scheduling that suites drastically varying queue lengths. Our new insights in online learning can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Policy Adaptation via Language Optimization: Decomposing Tasks for Few-Shot Imitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learned language-conditioned robot policies often struggle to effectively adapt to new real-world tasks even when pre-trained across a diverse set of instructions. We propose a novel approach for few-shot adaptation to unseen tasks that exploits the semantic understanding of task decomposition provided by vision-language models (VLMs). Our method, Policy Adaptation via Language Optimization (PALO), combines a handful of demonstrations of a task with proposed language decompositions sampled from a VLM to quickly enable rapid nonparametric adaptation, avoiding the need for a larger fine-tuning dataset. We evaluate PALO on extensive real-world experiments consisting of challenging unseen, long-horizon robot manipulation tasks. We find that PALO is able of consistently complete long-horizon, multi-tier tasks in the real world, outperforming state of the art pre-trained generalist policies, and methods that have access to the same demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Conditional Image Generation with Explainable Latent Space Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of image synthesis, achieving fidelity to a reference image while adhering to conditional prompts remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that integrates a diffusion model with latent space manipulation and gradient-based selective attention mechanisms to address this issue. Leveraging Grad-SAM (Gradient-based Selective Attention Manipulation), we analyze the cross attention maps of the cross attention layers and gradients for the denoised latent vector, deriving importance scores of elements of denoised latent vector related to the subject of interest. Using this information, we create masks at specific timesteps during denoising to preserve subjects while seamlessly integrating the reference image features. This approach ensures the faithful formation of subjects based on conditional prompts, while concurrently refining the background for a more coherent composition. Our experiments on places365 dataset demonstrate promising results, with our proposed model achieving the lowest mean and median Frechet Inception Distance (FID) scores compared to baseline models, indicating superior fidelity preservation. Furthermore, our model exhibits competitive performance in aligning the generated images with provided textual descriptions, as evidenced by high CLIP scores. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in both fidelity preservation and textual context preservation, offering a significant advancement in text-to-image synthesis tasks.</description>

      <title>PACiM: A Sparsity-Centric Hybrid Compute-in-Memory Architecture via Probabilistic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximate computing emerges as a promising approach to enhance the efficiency of compute-in-memory (CiM) systems in deep neural network processing. However, traditional approximate techniques often significantly trade off accuracy for power efficiency, and fail to reduce data transfer between main memory and CiM banks, which dominates power consumption. This paper introduces a novel probabilistic approximate computation (PAC) method that leverages statistical techniques to approximate multiply-and-accumulation (MAC) operations, reducing approximation error by 4X compared to existing approaches. PAC enables efficient sparsity-based computation in CiM systems by simplifying complex MAC vector computations into scalar calculations. Moreover, PAC enables sparsity encoding and eliminates the LSB activations transmission, significantly reducing data reads and writes. This sets PAC apart from traditional approximate computing techniques, minimizing not only computation power but also memory accesses by 50%, thereby boosting system-level efficiency. We developed PACiM, a sparsity-centric architecture that fully exploits sparsity to reduce bit-serial cycles by 81% and achieves a peak 8b/8b efficiency of 14.63 TOPS/W in 65 nm CMOS while maintaining high accuracy of 93.85/72.36/66.02% on CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100/ImageNet benchmarks using a ResNet-18 model, demonstrating the effectiveness of our PAC methodology.</description>

      <title>Physics of Language Models: Part 2.2, How to Learn From Mistakes on Grade-School Math Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable performance in solving reasoning tasks; however, even the strongest models still occasionally make reasoning mistakes. Recently, there has been active research aimed at improving reasoning accuracy, particularly by using pretrained language models to "self-correct" their mistakes via multi-round prompting. In this paper, we follow this line of work but focus on understanding the usefulness of incorporating "error-correction" data directly into the pretraining stage. This data consists of erroneous solution steps immediately followed by their corrections. Using a synthetic math dataset, we show promising results: this type of pretrain data can help language models achieve higher reasoning accuracy directly (i.e., through simple auto-regression, without multi-round prompting) compared to pretraining on the same amount of error-free data. We also delve into many details, such as (1) how this approach differs from beam search, (2) how such data can be prepared, (3) whether masking is needed on the erroneous tokens, (4) the amount of error required, (5) whether such data can be deferred to the fine-tuning stage, and many others.</description>

Abstract: Enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles is crucial, especially given recent accidents involving automated systems. As passengers in these vehicles, humans' sensory perception and decision-making can be integrated with autonomous systems to improve safety. This study explores neural mechanisms in passenger-vehicle interactions, leading to the development of a Passenger Cognitive Model (PCM) and the Passenger EEG Decoding Strategy (PEDS). Central to PEDS is a novel Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) that captures spatial and temporal EEG data patterns. The CRNN, combined with stacking algorithms, achieves an accuracy of $85.0\% \pm 3.18\%$. Our findings highlight the predictive power of pre-event EEG data, enhancing the detection of hazardous scenarios and offering a network-driven framework for safer autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>Machine learning models for daily rainfall forecasting in Northern Tropical Africa using tropical wave predictors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models often underperform compared to simpler climatology-based precipitation forecasts in northern tropical Africa, even after statistical postprocessing. AI-based forecasting models show promise but have avoided precipitation due to its complexity. Synoptic-scale forcings like African easterly waves and other tropical waves (TWs) are important for predictability in tropical Africa, yet their value for predicting daily rainfall remains unexplored. This study uses two machine-learning models--gamma regression and a convolutional neural network (CNN)--trained on TW predictors from satellite-based GPM IMERG data to predict daily rainfall during the July-September monsoon season. Predictor variables are derived from the local amplitude and phase information of seven TW from the target and up-and-downstream neighboring grids at 1-degree spatial resolution. The ML models are combined with Easy Uncertainty Quantification (EasyUQ) to generate calibrated probabilistic forecasts and are compared with three benchmarks: Extended Probabilistic Climatology (EPC15), ECMWF operational ensemble forecast (ENS), and a probabilistic forecast from the ENS control member using EasyUQ (CTRL EasyUQ). The study finds that downstream predictor variables offer the highest predictability, with downstream tropical depression (TD)-type wave-based predictors being most important. Other waves like mixed-Rossby gravity (MRG), Kelvin, and inertio-gravity waves also contribute significantly but show regional preferences. ENS forecasts exhibit poor skill due to miscalibration. CTRL EasyUQ shows improvement over ENS and marginal enhancement over EPC15. Both gamma regression and CNN forecasts significantly outperform benchmarks in tropical Africa. This study highlights the potential of ML models trained on TW-based predictors to improve daily precipitation forecasts in tropical Africa.</description>

      <title>Do Recommender Systems Promote Local Music? A Reproducibility Study Using Music Streaming Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the influence of recommender systems on local music representation, discussing prior findings from an empirical study on the LFM-2b public dataset. This prior study argued that different recommender systems exhibit algorithmic biases shifting music consumption either towards or against local content. However, LFM-2b users do not reflect the diverse audience of music streaming services. To assess the robustness of this study's conclusions, we conduct a comparative analysis using proprietary listening data from a global music streaming service, which we publicly release alongside this paper. We observe significant differences in local music consumption patterns between our dataset and LFM-2b, suggesting that caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions on local music based solely on LFM-2b. Moreover, we show that the algorithmic biases exhibited in the original work vary in our dataset, and that several unexplored model parameters can significantly influence these biases and affect the study's conclusion on both datasets. Finally, we discuss the complexity of accurately labeling local music, emphasizing the risk of misleading conclusions due to unreliable, biased, or incomplete labels. To encourage further research and ensure reproducibility, we have publicly shared our dataset and code.</description>

      <title>WavTokenizer: an Efficient Acoustic Discrete Codec Tokenizer for Audio Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models have been effectively applied to modeling natural signals, such as images, video, speech, and audio. A crucial component of these models is the codec tokenizer, which compresses high-dimensional natural signals into lower-dimensional discrete tokens. In this paper, we introduce WavTokenizer, which offers several advantages over previous SOTA acoustic codec models in the audio domain: 1)extreme compression. By compressing the layers of quantizers and the temporal dimension of the discrete codec, one-second audio of 24kHz sampling rate requires only a single quantizer with 40 or 75 tokens. 2)improved subjective quality. Despite the reduced number of tokens, WavTokenizer achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with outstanding UTMOS scores and inherently contains richer semantic information. Specifically, we achieve these results by designing a broader VQ space, extended contextual windows, and improved attention networks, as well as introducing a powerful multi-scale discriminator and an inverse Fourier transform structure. We conducted extensive reconstruction experiments in the domains of speech, audio, and music. WavTokenizer exhibited strong performance across various objective and subjective metrics compared to state-of-the-art models. We also tested semantic information, VQ utilization, and adaptability to generative models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each module in WavTokenizer. The related code, demos, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/jishengpeng/WavTokenizer.</description>

      <title>SALSA: Speedy ASR-LLM Synchronous Aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing pre-trained LLMs to improve ASR systems, particularly for low-resource languages, is now an emerging area of research. Existing methods range from using LLMs for ASR error correction to tightly coupled systems that replace the ASR decoder with the LLM. These approaches either increase decoding time or require expensive training of the cross-attention layers. We propose SALSA, which couples the decoder layers of the ASR to the LLM decoder, while synchronously advancing both decoders. Such coupling is performed with a simple projection of the last decoder state, and is thus significantly more training efficient than earlier approaches. A challenge of our proposed coupling is handling the mismatch between the tokenizers of the LLM and ASR systems. We handle this mismatch using cascading tokenization with respect to the LLM and ASR vocabularies. We evaluate SALSA on 8 low-resource languages in the FLEURS benchmark, yielding substantial WER reductions of up to 38%.</description>

      <title>Statistical and Geometrical properties of regularized Kernel Kullback-Leibler divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the statistical and geometrical properties of the Kullback-Leibler divergence with kernel covariance operators (KKL) introduced by Bach [2022]. Unlike the classical Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence that involves density ratios, the KKL compares probability distributions through covariance operators (embeddings) in a reproducible kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and compute the Kullback-Leibler quantum divergence. This novel divergence hence shares parallel but different aspects with both the standard Kullback-Leibler between probability distributions and kernel embeddings metrics such as the maximum mean discrepancy. A limitation faced with the original KKL divergence is its inability to be defined for distributions with disjoint supports. To solve this problem, we propose in this paper a regularised variant that guarantees that the divergence is well defined for all distributions. We derive bounds that quantify the deviation of the regularised KKL to the original one, as well as finite-sample bounds. In addition, we provide a closed-form expression for the regularised KKL, specifically applicable when the distributions consist of finite sets of points, which makes it implementable. Furthermore, we derive a Wasserstein gradient descent scheme of the KKL divergence in the case of discrete distributions, and study empirically its properties to transport a set of points to a target distribution.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolution works for coastal simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning fine-scale details of a coastal ocean simulation from a coarse representation is a challenging task. For real-world applications, high-resolution simulations are necessary to advance understanding of many coastal processes, specifically, to predict flooding resulting from tsunamis and storm surges. We propose a Deep Network for Coastal Super-Resolution (DNCSR) for spatiotemporal enhancement to efficiently learn the high-resolution numerical solution. Given images of coastal simulations produced on low-resolution computational meshes using low polynomial order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations and a coarse temporal resolution, the proposed DNCSR learns to produce high-resolution free surface elevation and velocity visualizations in both time and space. To efficiently model the dynamic changes over time and space, we propose grid-aware spatiotemporal attention to project the temporal features to the spatial domain for non-local feature matching. The coordinate information is also utilized via positional encoding. For the final reconstruction, we use the spatiotemporal bilinear operation to interpolate the missing frames and then expand the feature maps to the frequency domain for residual mapping. Besides data-driven losses, the proposed physics-informed loss guarantees gradient consistency and momentum changes. Their combination contributes to the overall 24% improvements in RMSE. To train the proposed model, we propose a large-scale coastal simulation dataset and use it for model optimization and evaluation. Our method shows superior super-resolution quality and fast computation compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Android Malware Detection Based on RGB Images and Multi-feature Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the widespread adoption of smartphones, Android malware has become a significant challenge in the field of mobile device security. Current Android malware detection methods often rely on feature engineering to construct dynamic or static features, which are then used for learning. However, static feature-based methods struggle to counter code obfuscation, packing, and signing techniques, while dynamic feature-based methods involve time-consuming feature extraction. Image-based methods for Android malware detection offer better resilience against malware variants and polymorphic malware. This paper proposes an end-to-end Android malware detection technique based on RGB images and multi-feature fusion. The approach involves extracting Dalvik Executable (DEX) files, AndroidManifest.xml files, and API calls from APK files, converting them into grayscale images, and enhancing their texture features using Canny edge detection, histogram equalization, and adaptive thresholding techniques. These grayscale images are then combined into an RGB image containing multi-feature fusion information, which is analyzed using mainstream image classification models for Android malware detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively captures Android malware characteristics, achieving an accuracy of up to 97.25%, outperforming existing detection methods that rely solely on DEX files as classification features. Additionally, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of using the three key files for feature representation in the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Identifying Terrain Physical Parameters from Vision -- Towards Physical-Parameter-Aware Locomotion and Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying the physical properties of the surrounding environment is essential for robotic locomotion and navigation to deal with non-geometric hazards, such as slippery and deformable terrains. It would be of great benefit for robots to anticipate these extreme physical properties before contact; however, estimating environmental physical parameters from vision is still an open challenge. Animals can achieve this by using their prior experience and knowledge of what they have seen and how it felt. In this work, we propose a cross-modal self-supervised learning framework for vision-based environmental physical parameter estimation, which paves the way for future physical-property-aware locomotion and navigation. We bridge the gap between existing policies trained in simulation and identification of physical terrain parameters from vision. We propose to train a physical decoder in simulation to predict friction and stiffness from multi-modal input. The trained network allows the labeling of real-world images with physical parameters in a self-supervised manner to further train a visual network during deployment, which can densely predict the friction and stiffness from image data. We validate our physical decoder in simulation and the real world using a quadruped ANYmal robot, outperforming an existing baseline method. We show that our visual network can predict the physical properties in indoor and outdoor experiments while allowing fast adaptation to new environments.</description>

      <title>Transformers Meet ACT-R: Repeat-Aware and Sequential Listening Session Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music streaming services often leverage sequential recommender systems to predict the best music to showcase to users based on past sequences of listening sessions. Nonetheless, most sequential recommendation methods ignore or insufficiently account for repetitive behaviors. This is a crucial limitation for music recommendation, as repeatedly listening to the same song over time is a common phenomenon that can even change the way users perceive this song. In this paper, we introduce PISA (Psychology-Informed Session embedding using ACT-R), a session-level sequential recommender system that overcomes this limitation. PISA employs a Transformer architecture learning embedding representations of listening sessions and users using attention mechanisms inspired by Anderson's ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational), a cognitive architecture modeling human information access and memory dynamics. This approach enables us to capture dynamic and repetitive patterns from user behaviors, allowing us to effectively predict the songs they will listen to in subsequent sessions, whether they are repeated or new ones. We demonstrate the empirical relevance of PISA using both publicly available listening data from Last.fm and proprietary data from Deezer, a global music streaming service, confirming the critical importance of repetition modeling for sequential listening session recommendation. Along with this paper, we publicly release our proprietary dataset to foster future research in this field, as well as the source code of PISA to facilitate its future use.</description>

      <title>Subspace Representation Learning for Sparse Linear Arrays to Localize More Sources than Sensors: A Deep Learning Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localizing more sources than sensors with a sparse linear array (SLA) has long relied on minimizing a distance between two covariance matrices and recent algorithms often utilize semidefinite programming (SDP). Although deep neural network (DNN)-based methods offer new alternatives, they still depend on covariance matrix fitting. In this paper, we develop a novel methodology that estimates the co-array subspaces from a sample covariance for SLAs. Our methodology trains a DNN to learn signal and noise subspace representations that are invariant to the selection of bases. To learn such representations, we propose loss functions that gauge the separation between the desired and the estimated subspace. In particular, we propose losses that measure the length of the shortest path between subspaces viewed on a union of Grassmannians, and prove that it is possible for a DNN to approximate signal subspaces. The computation of learning subspaces of different dimensions is accelerated by a new batch sampling strategy called consistent rank sampling. The methodology is robust to array imperfections due to its geometry-agnostic and data-driven nature. In addition, we propose a fully end-to-end gridless approach that directly learns angles to study the possibility of bypassing subspace methods. Numerical results show that learning such subspace representations is more beneficial than learning covariances or angles. It outperforms conventional SDP-based methods such as the sparse and parametric approach (SPA) and existing DNN-based covariance reconstruction methods for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), snapshots, and source numbers for both perfect and imperfect arrays.</description>

      <title>Towards Infusing Auxiliary Knowledge for Distracted Driver Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distracted driving is a leading cause of road accidents globally. Identification of distracted driving involves reliably detecting and classifying various forms of driver distraction (e.g., texting, eating, or using in-car devices) from in-vehicle camera feeds to enhance road safety. This task is challenging due to the need for robust models that can generalize to a diverse set of driver behaviors without requiring extensive annotated datasets. In this paper, we propose KiD3, a novel method for distracted driver detection (DDD) by infusing auxiliary knowledge about semantic relations between entities in a scene and the structural configuration of the driver's pose. Specifically, we construct a unified framework that integrates the scene graphs, and driver pose information with the visual cues in video frames to create a holistic representation of the driver's actions.Our results indicate that KiD3 achieves a 13.64% accuracy improvement over the vision-only baseline by incorporating such auxiliary knowledge with visual information.</description>

      <title>Turbulence Strength $C_n^2$ Estimation from Video using Physics-based Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Images captured from a long distance suffer from dynamic image distortion due to turbulent flow of air cells with random temperatures, and thus refractive indices. This phenomenon, known as image dancing, is commonly characterized by its refractive-index structure constant $C_n^2$ as a measure of the turbulence strength. For many applications such as atmospheric forecast model, long-range/astronomy imaging, and aviation safety, optical communication technology, $C_n^2$ estimation is critical for accurately sensing the turbulent environment. Previous methods for $C_n^2$ estimation include estimation from meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity, wind shear, etc.) for single-point measurements, two-ended pathlength measurements from optical scintillometer for path-averaged $C_n^2$, and more recently estimating $C_n^2$ from passive video cameras for low cost and hardware complexity. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of classical image gradient methods for $C_n^2$ estimation and modern deep learning-based methods leveraging convolutional neural networks. To enable this, we collect a dataset of video capture along with reference scintillometer measurements for ground truth, and we release this unique dataset to the scientific community. We observe that deep learning methods can achieve higher accuracy when trained on similar data, but suffer from generalization errors to other, unseen imagery as compared to classical methods. To overcome this trade-off, we present a novel physics-based network architecture that combines learned convolutional layers with a differentiable image gradient method that maintains high accuracy while being generalizable across image datasets.</description>

      <title>3D Pose-Based Temporal Action Segmentation for Figure Skating: A Fine-Grained and Jump Procedure-Aware Annotation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding human actions from videos is essential in many domains, including sports. In figure skating, technical judgments are performed by watching skaters' 3D movements, and its part of the judging procedure can be regarded as a Temporal Action Segmentation (TAS) task. TAS tasks in figure skating that automatically assign temporal semantics to video are actively researched. However, there is a lack of datasets and effective methods for TAS tasks requiring 3D pose data. In this study, we first created the FS-Jump3D dataset of complex and dynamic figure skating jumps using optical markerless motion capture. We also propose a new fine-grained figure skating jump TAS dataset annotation method with which TAS models can learn jump procedures. In the experimental results, we validated the usefulness of 3D pose features as input and the fine-grained dataset for the TAS model in figure skating. FS-Jump3D Dataset is available at https://github.com/ryota-skating/FS-Jump3D.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Modelling of String Dynamics: A Comparison of State Space and Koopman based Deep Learning Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an examination of State Space Models (SSM) and Koopman-based deep learning methods for modelling the dynamics of both linear and non-linear stiff strings. Through experiments with datasets generated under different initial conditions and sample rates, we assess the capacity of these models to accurately model the complex behaviours observed in string dynamics. Our findings indicate that our proposed Koopman-based model performs as well as or better than other existing approaches in non-linear cases for long-sequence modelling.
  We inform the design of these architectures with the structure of the problems at hand. Although challenges remain in extending model predictions beyond the training horizon (i.e., extrapolation), the focus of our investigation lies in the models' ability to generalise across different initial conditions within the training time interval. This research contributes insights into the physical modelling of dynamical systems (in particular those addressing musical acoustics) by offering a comparative overview of these and previous methods and introducing innovative strategies for model improvement. Our results highlight the efficacy of these models in simulating non-linear dynamics and emphasise their wide-ranging applicability in accurately modelling dynamical systems over extended sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning's widespread adoption in decision-making processes raises concerns about fairness, particularly regarding the treatment of sensitive features and potential discrimination against minorities. The software engineering community has responded by developing fairness-oriented metrics, empirical studies, and approaches. However, there remains a gap in understanding and categorizing practices for engineering fairness throughout the machine learning lifecycle. This paper presents a novel catalog of practices for addressing fairness in machine learning derived from a systematic mapping study. The study identifies and categorizes 28 practices from existing literature, mapping them onto different stages of the machine learning lifecycle. From this catalog, the authors extract actionable items and implications for both researchers and practitioners in software engineering. This work aims to provide a comprehensive resource for integrating fairness considerations into the development and deployment of machine learning systems, enhancing their reliability, accountability, and credibility.</description>

      <title>Mini-Omni: Language Models Can Hear, Talk While Thinking in Streaming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in language models have achieved significant progress. GPT-4o, as a new milestone, has enabled real-time conversations with humans, demonstrating near-human natural fluency. Such human-computer interaction necessitates models with the capability to perform reasoning directly with the audio modality and generate output in streaming. However, this remains beyond the reach of current academic models, as they typically depend on extra TTS systems for speech synthesis, resulting in undesirable latency. This paper introduces the Mini-Omni, an audio-based end-to-end conversational model, capable of real-time speech interaction. To achieve this capability, we propose a text-instructed speech generation method, along with batch-parallel strategies during inference to further boost the performance. Our method also helps to retain the original model's language capabilities with minimal degradation, enabling other works to establish real-time interaction capabilities. We call this training method "Any Model Can Talk". We also introduce the VoiceAssistant-400K dataset to fine-tune models optimized for speech output. To our best knowledge, Mini-Omni is the first fully end-to-end, open-source model for real-time speech interaction, offering valuable potential for future research.</description>

      <title>A Gradient Analysis Framework for Rewarding Good and Penalizing Bad Examples in Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), the standard objective of a language model (LM) that optimizes good examples probabilities, many studies have explored ways that also penalize bad examples for enhancing the quality of output distribution, including unlikelihood training, exponential maximizing average treatment effect (ExMATE), and direct preference optimization (DPO). To systematically compare these methods and further provide a unified recipe for LM optimization, in this paper, we present a unique angle of gradient analysis of loss functions that simultaneously reward good examples and penalize bad ones in LMs. Through both mathematical results and experiments on CausalDialogue and Anthropic HH-RLHF datasets, we identify distinct functional characteristics among these methods. We find that ExMATE serves as a superior surrogate for MLE, and that combining DPO with ExMATE instead of MLE further enhances both the statistical (5-7%) and generative (+18% win rate) performance.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning without Human Feedback for Last Mile Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning is used to align language models with human preference signals after first pre-training the model to predict the next token of text within a large corpus using likelihood maximization. Before being deployed in a specific domain, models are often further fine-tuned on task specific data. Since human preferences are often unavailable for the last step, it is performed using likelihood maximization as that is the typical default method. However, reinforcement learning has other advantages besides facilitating alignment to a human derived reward function. For one, whereas likelihood maximization is a form of imitation learning in which the model is trained on what to do under ideal conditions, reinforcement learning is not limited to demonstrating actions just for optimally reached states and trains a model what to do under a range of scenarios as it explores the policy space. In addition, it also trains a model what not to do, suppressing competitive but poor actions. This work develops a framework for last-mile fine-tuning using reinforcement learning and tests whether it garners performance gains. The experiments center on abstractive summarization, but the framework is general and broadly applicable. Use of the procedure produced significantly better results than likelihood maximization when comparing raw predictions. For the specific data tested, the gap could be bridged by employing post-processing of the maximum likelihood outputs. Nonetheless, the framework offers a new avenue for model optimization in situations where post-processing may be less straightforward or effective, and it can be extended to include more complex classes of undesirable outputs to penalize and train against, such as hallucinations.</description>

      <title>UV-free Texture Generation with Denoising and Geodesic Heat Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seams, distortions, wasted UV space, vertex-duplication, and varying resolution over the surface are the most prominent issues of the standard UV-based texturing of meshes. These issues are particularly acute when automatic UV-unwrapping techniques are used. For this reason, instead of generating textures in automatically generated UV-planes like most state-of-the-art methods, we propose to represent textures as coloured point-clouds whose colours are generated by a denoising diffusion probabilistic model constrained to operate on the surface of 3D objects. Our sampling and resolution agnostic generative model heavily relies on heat diffusion over the surface of the meshes for spatial communication between points. To enable processing of arbitrarily sampled point-cloud textures and ensure long-distance texture consistency we introduce a fast re-sampling of the mesh spectral properties used during the heat diffusion and introduce a novel heat-diffusion-based self-attention mechanism. Our code and pre-trained models are available at github.com/simofoti/UV3-TeD.</description>

Abstract: Mistakes in machine learning practice are commonplace, and can result in a loss of confidence in the findings and products of machine learning. This guide outlines common mistakes that occur when using machine learning, and what can be done to avoid them. Whilst it should be accessible to anyone with a basic understanding of machine learning techniques, it focuses on issues that are of particular concern within academic research, such as the need to do rigorous comparisons and reach valid conclusions. It covers five stages of the machine learning process: what to do before model building, how to reliably build models, how to robustly evaluate models, how to compare models fairly, and how to report results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conditional Independence (CI) graphs are a type of probabilistic graphical models that are primarily used to gain insights about feature relationships. Each edge represents the partial correlation between the connected features which gives information about their direct dependence. In this survey, we list out different methods and study the advances in techniques developed to recover CI graphs. We cover traditional optimization methods as well as recently developed deep learning architectures along with their recommended implementations. To facilitate wider adoption, we include preliminaries that consolidate associated operations, for example techniques to obtain covariance matrix for mixed datatypes.</description>

      <title>FilFL: Client Filtering for Optimized Client Participation in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning, an emerging machine learning paradigm, enables clients to collaboratively train a model without exchanging local data. Clients participating in the training process significantly impact the convergence rate, learning efficiency, and model generalization. We propose a novel approach, client filtering, to improve model generalization and optimize client participation and training. The proposed method periodically filters available clients to identify a subset that maximizes a combinatorial objective function with an efficient greedy filtering algorithm. Thus, the clients are assessed as a combination rather than individually. We theoretically analyze the convergence of federated learning with client filtering in heterogeneous settings and evaluate its performance across diverse vision and language tasks, including realistic scenarios with time-varying client availability. Our empirical results demonstrate several benefits of our approach, including improved learning efficiency, faster convergence, and up to 10% higher test accuracy than training without client filtering.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Log-Euclidean Metrics for SPD Matrix Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15477v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices have received wide attention in machine learning due to their intrinsic capacity to encode underlying structural correlation in data. Many successful Riemannian metrics have been proposed to reflect the non-Euclidean geometry of SPD manifolds. However, most existing metric tensors are fixed, which might lead to sub-optimal performance for SPD matrix learning, especially for deep SPD neural networks. To remedy this limitation, we leverage the commonly encountered pullback techniques and propose Adaptive Log-Euclidean Metrics (ALEMs), which extend the widely used Log-Euclidean Metric (LEM). Compared with the previous Riemannian metrics, our metrics contain learnable parameters, which can better adapt to the complex dynamics of Riemannian neural networks with minor extra computations. We also present a complete theoretical analysis to support our ALEMs, including algebraic and Riemannian properties. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate the merit of the proposed metrics in improving the performance of SPD neural networks. The efficacy of our metrics is further showcased on a set of recently developed Riemannian building blocks, including Riemannian batch normalization, Riemannian Residual blocks, and Riemannian classifiers.</description>

      <title>A Best-of-Both-Worlds Algorithm for Constrained MDPs with Long-Term Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study online learning in episodic constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs), where the learner aims at collecting as much reward as possible over the episodes, while satisfying some long-term constraints during the learning process. Rewards and constraints can be selected either stochastically or adversarially, and the transition function is not known to the learner. While online learning in classical (unconstrained) MDPs has received considerable attention over the last years, the setting of CMDPs is still largely unexplored. This is surprising, since in real-world applications, such as, e.g., autonomous driving, automated bidding, and recommender systems, there are usually additional constraints and specifications that an agent has to obey during the learning process. In this paper, we provide the first best-of-both-worlds algorithm for CMDPs with long-term constraints, in the flavor of Balseiro et al. (2023). Our algorithm is capable of handling settings in which rewards and constraints are selected either stochastically or adversarially, without requiring any knowledge of the underling process. Moreover, our algorithm matches state-of-the-art regret and constraint violation bounds for settings in which constraints are selected stochastically, while it is the first to provide guarantees in the case in which they are chosen adversarially.</description>

      <title>Graphical vs. Deep Generative Models: Measuring the Impact of Differentially Private Mechanisms and Budgets on Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative models trained with Differential Privacy (DP) can produce synthetic data while reducing privacy risks. However, navigating their privacy-utility tradeoffs makes finding the best models for specific settings/tasks challenging. This paper bridges this gap by profiling how DP generative models for tabular data distribute privacy budgets across rows and columns, which is one of the primary sources of utility degradation. We compare graphical and deep generative models, focusing on the key factors contributing to how privacy budgets are spent, i.e., underlying modeling techniques, DP mechanisms, and data dimensionality.
  Through our measurement study, we shed light on the characteristics that make different models suitable for various settings and tasks. For instance, we find that graphical models distribute privacy budgets horizontally and thus cannot handle relatively wide datasets for a fixed training time; also, the performance on the task they were optimized for monotonically increases with more data but could also overfit. Deep generative models spend their budgets per iteration, so their behavior is less predictable with varying dataset dimensions, but are more flexible as they could perform better if trained on more features. Moreover, low levels of privacy ($\epsilon\geq100$) could help some models generalize, achieving better results than without applying DP. We believe our work will aid the deployment of DP synthetic data techniques by navigating through the best candidate models vis-a-vis the dataset features, desired privacy levels, and downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Learning from Heterogeneity: A Dynamic Learning Framework for Hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural network (GNN) has gained increasing popularity in recent years owing to its capability and flexibility in modeling complex graph structure data. Among all graph learning methods, hypergraph learning is a technique for exploring the implicit higher-order correlations when training the embedding space of the graph. In this paper, we propose a hypergraph learning framework named LFH that is capable of dynamic hyperedge construction and attentive embedding update utilizing the heterogeneity attributes of the graph. Specifically, in our framework, the high-quality features are first generated by the pairwise fusion strategy that utilizes explicit graph structure information when generating initial node embedding. Afterwards, a hypergraph is constructed through the dynamic grouping of implicit hyperedges, followed by the type-specific hypergraph learning process. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conduct comprehensive experiments on several popular datasets with eleven state-of-the-art models on both node classification and link prediction tasks, which fall into categories of homogeneous pairwise graph learning, heterogeneous pairwise graph learning, and hypergraph learning. The experiment results demonstrate a significant performance gain (average 12.5% in node classification and 13.3% in link prediction) compared with recent state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Learning to Prompt Your Domain for Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03103v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompt learning has recently become a very efficient transfer learning paradigm for Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) models. Compared with fine-tuning the entire encoder, prompt learning can obtain highly competitive results by optimizing only a small number of parameters, which presents considerably exciting benefits for federated learning applications that prioritizes communication efficiency. However, in this work, we identify that directly transferring prompt learning approaches into federated learning does not yield favorable results since the model often suffers from considerable domain gaps across different clients. To address this issue, we propose ADAPT, a novel domain-aware prompt learning approach that facilitates both intra- and inter-domain prompts across federated participants. The basic idea of ADAPT is that the prompted CLIP should detect the input image's domain correspondence and before making the prediction of its category. Extensive experiments of ADAPT demonstrate its significant efficiency and effectiveness in federated learning. For example, by learning and sharing only 0.08M parameters, our ADAPT attains a 68.4% average accuracy over six domains in the DomainNet dataset, which improves the original CLIP by a large margin of 14.8%.</description>

      <title>CAST: Cluster-Aware Self-Training for Tabular Data via Reliable Confidence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tabular data is one of the most widely used data modalities, encompassing numerous datasets with substantial amounts of unlabeled data. Despite this prevalence, there is a notable lack of simple and versatile methods for utilizing unlabeled data in the tabular domain, where both gradient-boosting decision trees and neural networks are employed. In this context, self-training has gained attraction due to its simplicity and versatility, yet it is vulnerable to noisy pseudo-labels caused by erroneous confidence. Several solutions have been proposed to handle this problem, but they often compromise the inherent advantages of self-training, resulting in limited applicability in the tabular domain. To address this issue, we explore a novel direction of reliable confidence in self-training contexts and conclude that self-training can be improved by making that the confidence, which represents the value of the pseudo-label, aligns with the cluster assumption. In this regard, we propose Cluster-Aware Self-Training (CAST) for tabular data, which enhances existing self-training algorithms at a negligible cost while maintaining simplicity and versatility. Concretely, CAST calibrates confidence by regularizing the classifier's confidence based on local density for each class in the labeled training data, resulting in lower confidence for pseudo-labels in low-density regions. Extensive empirical evaluations on up to 21 real-world datasets confirm not only the superior performance of CAST but also its robustness in various setups in self-training contexts.</description>

      <title>Gradient Descent Fails to Learn High-frequency Functions and Modular Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classes of target functions containing a large number of approximately orthogonal elements are known to be hard to learn by the Statistical Query algorithms. Recently this classical fact re-emerged in a theory of gradient-based optimization of neural networks. In the novel framework, the hardness of a class is usually quantified by the variance of the gradient with respect to a random choice of a target function.
  A set of functions of the form $x\to ax \bmod p$, where $a$ is taken from ${\mathbb Z}_p$, has attracted some attention from deep learning theorists and cryptographers recently. This class can be understood as a subset of $p$-periodic functions on ${\mathbb Z}$ and is tightly connected with a class of high-frequency periodic functions on the real line.
  We present a mathematical analysis of limitations and challenges associated with using gradient-based learning techniques to train a high-frequency periodic function or modular multiplication from examples. We highlight that the variance of the gradient is negligibly small in both cases when either a frequency or the prime base $p$ is large. This in turn prevents such a learning algorithm from being successful.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-based Fairness Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unfair predictions of machine learning (ML) models impede their broad acceptance in real-world settings. Tackling this arduous challenge first necessitates defining what it means for an ML model to be fair. This has been addressed by the ML community with various measures of fairness that depend on the prediction outcomes of the ML models, either at the group level or the individual level. These fairness measures are limited in that they utilize point predictions, neglecting their variances, or uncertainties, making them susceptible to noise, missingness and shifts in data. In this paper, we first show that an ML model may appear to be fair with existing point-based fairness measures but biased against a demographic group in terms of prediction uncertainties. Then, we introduce new fairness measures based on different types of uncertainties, namely, aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. We demonstrate on many datasets that (i) our uncertainty-based measures are complementary to existing measures of fairness, and (ii) they provide more insights about the underlying issues leading to bias.</description>

      <title>Uniformly Safe RL with Objective Suppression for Multi-Constraint Safety-Critical Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning tasks are a challenging domain despite being very common in the real world. The widely adopted CMDP model constrains the risks in expectation, which makes room for dangerous behaviors in long-tail states. In safety-critical domains, such behaviors could lead to disastrous outcomes. To address this issue, we first describe the problem with a stronger Uniformly Constrained MDP (UCMDP) model where we impose constraints on all reachable states; we then propose Objective Suppression, a novel method that adaptively suppresses the task reward maximizing objectives according to a safety critic, as a solution to the Lagrangian dual of a UCMDP. We benchmark Objective Suppression in two multi-constraint safety domains, including an autonomous driving domain where any incorrect behavior can lead to disastrous consequences. On the driving domain, we evaluate on open source and proprietary data and evaluate transfer to a real autonomous fleet. Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed method, when combined with existing safe RL algorithms, can match the task reward achieved by baselines with significantly fewer constraint violations.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Label Noise on Graph via Topological Sample Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01942v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the success of the carefully-annotated benchmarks, the effectiveness of existing graph neural networks (GNNs) can be considerably impaired in practice when the real-world graph data is noisily labeled. Previous explorations in sample selection have been demonstrated as an effective way for robust learning with noisy labels, however, the conventional studies focus on i.i.d data, and when moving to non-iid graph data and GNNs, two notable challenges remain: (1) nodes located near topological class boundaries are very informative for classification but cannot be successfully distinguished by the heuristic sample selection. (2) there is no available measure that considers the graph topological information to promote sample selection in a graph. To address this dilemma, we propose a $\textit{Topological Sample Selection}$ (TSS) method that boosts the informative sample selection process in a graph by utilising topological information. We theoretically prove that our procedure minimizes an upper bound of the expected risk under target clean distribution, and experimentally show the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

Abstract: Interpretability is the next frontier in machine learning research. In the search for white box models - as opposed to black box models, like random forests or neural networks - rule induction algorithms are a logical and promising option, since the rules can easily be understood by humans. Fuzzy and rough set theory have been successfully applied to this archetype, almost always separately. As both approaches to rule induction involve granular computing based on the concept of equivalence classes, it is natural to combine them. The QuickRules\cite{JensenCornelis2009} algorithm was a first attempt at using fuzzy rough set theory for rule induction. It is based on QuickReduct, a greedy algorithm for building decision reducts. QuickRules already showed an improvement over other rule induction methods. However, to evaluate the full potential of a fuzzy rough rule induction algorithm, one needs to start from the foundations. In this paper, we introduce a novel rule induction algorithm called Fuzzy Rough Rule Induction (FRRI). We provide background and explain the workings of our algorithm. Furthermore, we perform a computational experiment to evaluate the performance of our algorithm and compare it to other state-of-the-art rule induction approaches. We find that our algorithm is more accurate while creating small rulesets consisting of relatively short rules. We end the paper by outlining some directions for future work.</description>

      <title>GEAR: An Efficient KV Cache Compression Recipe for Near-Lossless Generative Inference of LLM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Key-value (KV) caching has become the de-facto to accelerate generation speed for large language models (LLMs) inference. However, the growing cache demand with increasing sequence length has transformed LLM inference to be a memory bound problem, significantly constraining the system throughput. Existing methods rely on dropping unimportant tokens or quantizing all entries uniformly. Such methods, however, often incur high approximation errors to represent the compressed matrices. The autoregressive decoding process further compounds the error of each step, resulting in critical deviation in model generation and deterioration of performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose GEAR, an efficient KV cache compression framework that achieves near-lossless high-ratio compression. GEAR first applies quantization to majority of entries of similar magnitudes to ultra-low precision. It then employs a low rank matrix to approximate the quantization error, and a sparse matrix to remedy individual errors from outlier entries. By adeptly integrating three techniques, GEAR is able to fully exploit their synergistic potentials. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to alternatives, GEAR achieves near-lossless 4-bit KV cache compression with up to 2.38x throughput improvement, while reducing peak-memory size up to 2.29x. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoKang-Timmy/GEAR.</description>

      <title>Heat Death of Generative Models in Closed-Loop Learning</title>

Abstract: Improvement and adoption of generative machine learning models is rapidly accelerating, as exemplified by the popularity of LLMs (Large Language Models) for text, and diffusion models for image generation. As generative models become widespread, data they generate is incorporated into shared content through the public web. This opens the question of what happens when data generated by a model is fed back to the model in subsequent training campaigns. This is a question about the stability of the training process, whether the distribution of publicly accessible content, which we refer to as "knowledge", remains stable or collapses.
  Small scale empirical experiments reported in the literature show that this closed-loop training process is prone to degenerating. Models may start producing gibberish data, or sample from only a small subset of the desired data distribution (a phenomenon referred to as mode collapse). So far there has been only limited theoretical understanding of this process, in part due to the complexity of the deep networks underlying these generative models.
  The aim of this paper is to provide insights into this process (that we refer to as "generative closed-loop learning") by studying the learning dynamics of generative models that are fed back their own produced content in addition to their original training dataset. The sampling of many of these models can be controlled via a "temperature" parameter. Using dynamical systems tools, we show that, unless a sufficient amount of external data is introduced at each iteration, any non-trivial temperature leads the model to asymptotically degenerate. In fact, either the generative distribution collapses to a small set of outputs or becomes uniform over a large set of outputs.</description>

Abstract: The integration of Foundation Models (FMs) with Federated Learning (FL) presents a transformative paradigm in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This integration offers enhanced capabilities while addressing concerns of privacy, data decentralization, and computational efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the emerging field of Federated Foundation Models (FedFM), elucidating their synergistic relationship and exploring novel methodologies, challenges, and future directions that the FL research field needs to focus on in order to thrive in the age of FMs. A systematic multi-tiered taxonomy is proposed, categorizing existing FedFM approaches for model training, aggregation, trustworthiness, and incentivization. Key challenges, including how to enable FL to deal with high complexity of computational demands, privacy considerations, contribution evaluation, and communication efficiency, are thoroughly discussed. Moreover, the paper explores the intricate challenges of communication, scalability, and security inherent in training/fine-tuning FMs via FL. It highlights the potential of quantum computing to revolutionize the processes of training, inference, optimization, and data encryption. This survey also introduces the implementation requirement of FedFM and some practical FedFM applications. Then, this survey provides the lessons with a clear understanding of our findings for FedFM. Finally, this survey not only provides insights into the current state and challenges of FedFM but also paves the way for future research directions, emphasizing the need for developing trustworthy solutions. It serves as a foundational guide for researchers and practitioners interested in contributing to this interdisciplinary and rapidly advancing field.</description>

      <title>Efficient Topology-aware Data Augmentation for High-Degree Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05482v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a potent tool for learning on graph-structured data and won fruitful successes in varied fields. The majority of GNNs follow the message-passing paradigm, where representations of each node are learned by recursively aggregating features of its neighbors. However, this mechanism brings severe over-smoothing and efficiency issues over high-degree graphs (HDGs), wherein most nodes have dozens (or even hundreds) of neighbors, such as social networks, transaction graphs, power grids, etc. Additionally, such graphs usually encompass rich and complex structure semantics, which are hard to capture merely by feature aggregations in GNNs. Motivated by the above limitations, we propose TADA, an efficient and effective front-mounted data augmentation framework for GNNs on HDGs. Under the hood, TADA includes two key modules: (i) feature expansion with structure embeddings, and (ii) topology- and attribute-aware graph sparsification. The former obtains augmented node features and enhanced model capacity by encoding the graph structure into high-quality structure embeddings with our highly-efficient sketching method. Further, by exploiting task-relevant features extracted from graph structures and attributes, the second module enables the accurate identification and reduction of numerous redundant/noisy edges from the input graph, thereby alleviating over-smoothing and facilitating faster feature aggregations over HDGs. Empirically, TADA considerably improves the predictive performance of mainstream GNN models on 8 real homophilic/heterophilic HDGs in terms of node classification, while achieving efficient training and inference processes.</description>

      <title>Misam: Using ML in Dataflow Selection of Sparse-Sparse Matrix Multiplication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a critical operation in numerous fields, including scientific computing, graph analytics, and deep learning. These applications exploit the sparsity of matrices to reduce storage and computational demands. However, the irregular structure of sparse matrices poses significant challenges for performance optimization. Traditional hardware accelerators are tailored for specific sparsity patterns with fixed dataflow schemes - inner, outer, and row-wise but often perform suboptimally when the actual sparsity deviates from these predetermined patterns. As the use of SpGEMM expands across various domains, each with distinct sparsity characteristics, the demand for hardware accelerators that can efficiently handle a range of sparsity patterns is increasing. This paper presents a machine learning based approach for adaptively selecting the most appropriate dataflow scheme for SpGEMM tasks with diverse sparsity patterns. By employing decision trees and deep reinforcement learning, we explore the potential of these techniques to surpass heuristic-based methods in identifying optimal dataflow schemes. We evaluate our models by comparing their performance with that of a heuristic, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Our findings suggest that using machine learning for dynamic dataflow selection in hardware accelerators can provide upto 28 times gains.</description>

Abstract: Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are extensively employed in graph learning tasks but suffer from limitations such as the restricted scope of information exchange, by being confined to neighboring nodes during each round of message passing. Various strategies have been proposed to address these limitations, including incorporating virtual nodes to facilitate global information exchange. In this study, we introduce the Hierarchical Support Graph (HSG), an extension of the virtual node concept created through recursive coarsening of the original graph. This approach provides a flexible framework for enhancing information flow in graphs, independent of the specific MPNN layers utilized. We present a theoretical analysis of HSGs, investigate their empirical performance, and demonstrate that HSGs can surpass other methods augmented with virtual nodes, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>Enabling Causal Discovery in Post-Nonlinear Models with Normalizing Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Post-nonlinear (PNL) causal models stand out as a versatile and adaptable framework for modeling intricate causal relationships. However, accurately capturing the invertibility constraint required in PNL models remains challenging in existing studies. To address this problem, we introduce CAF-PoNo (Causal discovery via Normalizing Flows for Post-Nonlinear models), harnessing the power of the normalizing flows architecture to enforce the crucial invertibility constraint in PNL models. Through normalizing flows, our method precisely reconstructs the hidden noise, which plays a vital role in cause-effect identification through statistical independence testing. Furthermore, the proposed approach exhibits remarkable extensibility, as it can be seamlessly expanded to facilitate multivariate causal discovery via causal order identification, empowering us to efficiently unravel complex causal relationships. Extensive experimental evaluations on both simulated and real datasets consistently demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in both bivariate and multivariate causal discovery tasks.</description>

      <title>Scalable Variational Causal Discovery Unconstrained by Acyclicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian causal discovery offers the power to quantify epistemic uncertainties among a broad range of structurally diverse causal theories potentially explaining the data, represented in forms of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, existing methods struggle with efficient DAG sampling due to the complex acyclicity constraint. In this study, we propose a scalable Bayesian approach to effectively learn the posterior distribution over causal graphs given observational data thanks to the ability to generate DAGs without explicitly enforcing acyclicity. Specifically, we introduce a novel differentiable DAG sampling method that can generate a valid acyclic causal graph by mapping an unconstrained distribution of implicit topological orders to a distribution over DAGs. Given this efficient DAG sampling scheme, we are able to model the posterior distribution over causal graphs using a simple variational distribution over a continuous domain, which can be learned via the variational inference framework. Extensive empirical experiments on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Data-Limited Graph Neural Networks by Actively Distilling Knowledge from Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphs are pervasive in the real-world, such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and knowledge graphs. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have great ability in node classification, a fundamental task on graphs. Unfortunately, conventional GNNs still face challenges in scenarios with few labeled nodes, despite the prevalence of few-shot node classification tasks in real-world applications. To address this challenge, various approaches have been proposed, including graph meta-learning, transfer learning, and methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs). However, traditional meta-learning and transfer learning methods often require prior knowledge from base classes or fail to exploit the potential advantages of unlabeled nodes. Meanwhile, LLM-based methods may overlook the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs and rely heavily on the quality of generated contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates LLMs and GNNs, leveraging the zero-shot inference and reasoning capabilities of LLMs and employing a Graph-LLM-based active learning paradigm to enhance GNNs' performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in improving node classification accuracy with considerably limited labeled data, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines by significant margins.</description>

Abstract: We address the problem of verifying neural networks against geometric transformations of the input image, including rotation, scaling, shearing, and translation. The proposed method computes provably sound piecewise linear constraints for the pixel values by using sampling and linear approximations in combination with branch-and-bound Lipschitz optimisation. The method obtains provably tighter over-approximations of the perturbation region than the present state-of-the-art. We report results from experiments on a comprehensive set of verification benchmarks on MNIST and CIFAR10. We show that our proposed implementation resolves up to 32% more verification cases than present approaches.</description>

      <title>LlamaDuo: LLMOps Pipeline for Seamless Migration from Service LLMs to Small-Scale Local LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of cloud-based proprietary large language models (LLMs) has introduced significant challenges, including operational dependencies, privacy concerns, and the necessity of continuous internet connectivity. In this work, we introduce an LLMOps pipeline, "LlamaDuo", for the seamless migration of knowledge and abilities from service-oriented LLMs to smaller, locally manageable models. This pipeline is crucial for ensuring service continuity in the presence of operational failures, strict privacy policies, or offline requirements. Our LlamaDuo involves fine-tuning a small language model against the service LLM using a synthetic dataset generated by the latter. If the performance of the fine-tuned model falls short of expectations, it is enhanced by further fine-tuning with additional similar data created by the service LLM. This iterative process guarantees that the smaller model can eventually match or even surpass the service LLM's capabilities in specific downstream tasks, offering a practical and scalable solution for managing AI deployments in constrained environments. Extensive experiments with leading edge LLMs are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness, adaptability, and affordability of LlamaDuo across various downstream tasks. Our pipeline implementation is available at https://github.com/deep-diver/llamaduo.</description>

Abstract: In this survey, we provide an overview of category theory-derived machine learning from four mainstream perspectives: gradient-based learning, probability-based learning, invariance and equivalence-based learning, and topos-based learning. For the first three topics, we primarily review research in the past five years, updating and expanding on the previous survey by Shiebler et al.. The fourth topic, which delves into higher category theory, particularly topos theory, is surveyed for the first time in this paper. In certain machine learning methods, the compositionality of functors plays a vital role, prompting the development of specific categorical frameworks. However, when considering how the global properties of a network reflect in local structures and how geometric properties are expressed with logic, the topos structure becomes particularly significant and profound.</description>

      <title>Neighborhood and Global Perturbations Supported SAM in Federated Learning: From Local Tweaks To Global Awareness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) can be coordinated under the orchestration of a central server to collaboratively build a privacy-preserving model without the need for data exchange. However, participant data heterogeneity leads to local optima divergence, subsequently affecting convergence outcomes. Recent research has focused on global sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) and dynamic regularization techniques to enhance consistency between global and local generalization and optimization objectives. Nonetheless, the estimation of global SAM introduces additional computational and memory overhead, while dynamic regularization suffers from bias in the local and global dual variables due to training isolation. In this paper, we propose a novel FL algorithm, FedTOGA, designed to consider optimization and generalization objectives while maintaining minimal uplink communication overhead. By linking local perturbations to global updates, global generalization consistency is improved. Additionally, global updates are used to correct local dynamic regularizers, reducing dual variables bias and enhancing optimization consistency. Global updates are passively received by clients, reducing overhead. We also propose neighborhood perturbation to approximate local perturbation, analyzing its strengths and limitations. Theoretical analysis shows FedTOGA achieves faster convergence $O(1/T)$ under non-convex functions. Empirical studies demonstrate that FedTOGA outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, with a 1\% accuracy increase and 30\% faster convergence, achieving state-of-the-art.</description>

Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks represent a fascinating confluence of deep learning and probabilistic reasoning, offering a compelling framework for understanding uncertainty in complex predictive models. In this paper, we investigate the use of the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson algorithm and its Langevin version to sample from the reparametrised posterior distribution of the weights as the widths of Bayesian Neural Networks grow larger. In addition to being robust in the infinite-dimensional setting, we prove that the acceptance probabilities of the proposed methods approach 1 as the width of the network increases, independently of any stepsize tuning. Moreover, we examine and compare how the mixing speeds of the underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo, the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson and the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin samplers are influenced by changes in the network width in some real-world cases. Our findings suggest that, in wide Bayesian Neural Networks configurations, the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson method allows for more efficient sampling of the reparametrised posterior distribution, as evidenced by a higher effective sample size and improved diagnostic results compared with the other analysed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Post-processing fairness with minimal changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel post-processing algorithm that is both model-agnostic and does not require the sensitive attribute at test time. In addition, our algorithm is explicitly designed to enforce minimal changes between biased and debiased predictions; a property that, while highly desirable, is rarely prioritized as an explicit objective in fairness literature. Our approach leverages a multiplicative factor applied to the logit value of probability scores produced by a black-box classifier. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through empirical evaluations, comparing its performance against other four debiasing algorithms on two widely used datasets in fairness research.</description>

      <title>No Regrets: Investigating and Improving Regret Approximations for Curriculum Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What data or environments to use for training to improve downstream performance is a longstanding and very topical question in reinforcement learning. In particular, Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) methods have gained recent attention as their adaptive curricula enable agents to be robust to in- and out-of-distribution tasks. We ask to what extent these methods are themselves robust when applied to a novel setting, closely inspired by a real-world robotics problem. Surprisingly, we find that the state-of-the-art UED methods either do not improve upon the na\"{i}ve baseline of Domain Randomisation (DR), or require substantial hyperparameter tuning to do so. Our analysis shows that this is due to their underlying scoring functions failing to predict intuitive measures of ``learnability'', i.e., in finding the settings that the agent sometimes solves, but not always. Based on this, we instead directly train on levels with high learnability and find that this simple and intuitive approach outperforms UED methods and DR in several binary-outcome environments, including on our domain and the standard UED domain of Minigrid. We further introduce a new adversarial evaluation procedure for directly measuring robustness, closely mirroring the conditional value at risk (CVaR). We open-source all our code and present visualisations of final policies here: https://github.com/amacrutherford/sampling-for-learnability.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Predictive Features of Person-Centric Knowledge Graph Embeddings: Unfolding Ablation Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing novel predictive models with complex biomedical information is challenging due to various idiosyncrasies related to heterogeneity, standardization or sparseness of the data. We previously introduced a person-centric ontology to organize information about individual patients, and a representation learning framework to extract person-centric knowledge graphs (PKGs) and to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to examine the results of GNN models trained with both structured and unstructured information from the MIMIC-III dataset. Through ablation studies on different clinical, demographic, and social data, we show the robustness of this approach in identifying predictive features in PKGs for the task of readmission prediction.</description>

      <title>VFLIP: A Backdoor Defense for Vertical Federated Learning via Identification and Purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) focuses on handling vertically partitioned data over FL participants. Recent studies have discovered a significant vulnerability in VFL to backdoor attacks which specifically target the distinct characteristics of VFL. Therefore, these attacks may neutralize existing defense mechanisms designed primarily for Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL) and deep neural networks. In this paper, we present the first backdoor defense, called VFLIP, specialized for VFL. VFLIP employs the identification and purification techniques that operate at the inference stage, consequently improving the robustness against backdoor attacks to a great extent. VFLIP first identifies backdoor-triggered embeddings by adopting a participant-wise anomaly detection approach. Subsequently, VFLIP conducts purification which removes the embeddings identified as malicious and reconstructs all the embeddings based on the remaining embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR10, CINIC10, Imagenette, NUS-WIDE, and BankMarketing to demonstrate that VFLIP can effectively mitigate backdoor attacks in VFL. https://github.com/blingcho/VFLIP-esorics24</description>

      <title>GANs Conditioning Methods: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have seen significant advancements, leading to their widespread adoption across various fields. The original GAN architecture enables the generation of images without any specific control over the content, making it an unconditional generation process. However, many practical applications require precise control over the generated output, which has led to the development of conditional GANs (cGANs) that incorporate explicit conditioning to guide the generation process. cGANs extend the original framework by incorporating additional information (conditions), enabling the generation of samples that adhere to that specific criteria. Various conditioning methods have been proposed, each differing in how they integrate the conditioning information into both the generator and the discriminator networks. In this work, we review the conditioning methods proposed for GANs, exploring the characteristics of each method and highlighting their unique mechanisms and theoretical foundations. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis of these methods, evaluating their performance on various image datasets. Through these analyses, we aim to provide insights into the strengths and limitations of various conditioning techniques, guiding future research and application in generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Image Emotion Recognition: A Domain Adaptation Approach Using Facial Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.08388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a feature-based domain adaptation technique for identifying emotions in generic images, encompassing both facial and non-facial objects, as well as non-human components. This approach addresses the challenge of the limited availability of pre-trained models and well-annotated datasets for Image Emotion Recognition (IER). Initially, a deep-learning-based Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system is developed, classifying facial images into discrete emotion classes. Maintaining the same network architecture, this FER system is then adapted to recognize emotions in generic images through the application of discrepancy loss, enabling the model to effectively learn IER features while classifying emotions into categories such as 'happy,' 'sad,' 'hate,' and 'anger.' Additionally, a novel interpretability method, Divide and Conquer based Shap (DnCShap), is introduced to elucidate the visual features most relevant for emotion recognition. The proposed IER system demonstrated emotion classification accuracies of 60.98% for the IAPSa dataset, 58.86% for the ArtPhoto dataset, 69.13% for the FI dataset, and 58.06% for the EMOTIC dataset. The system effectively identifies the important visual features leading to specific emotion classifications and provides detailed embedding plots to explain the predictions, enhancing the understanding and trust in AI-driven emotion recognition systems.</description>

      <title>Convergence and sample complexity of natural policy gradient primal-dual methods for constrained MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.02346v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study sequential decision making problems aimed at maximizing the expected total reward while satisfying a constraint on the expected total utility. We employ the natural policy gradient method to solve the discounted infinite-horizon optimal control problem for Constrained Markov Decision Processes (constrained MDPs). Specifically, we propose a new Natural Policy Gradient Primal-Dual (NPG-PD) method that updates the primal variable via natural policy gradient ascent and the dual variable via projected sub-gradient descent. Although the underlying maximization involves a nonconcave objective function and a nonconvex constraint set, under the softmax policy parametrization we prove that our method achieves global convergence with sublinear rates regarding both the optimality gap and the constraint violation. Such convergence is independent of the size of the state-action space, i.e., it is~dimension-free. Furthermore, for log-linear and general smooth policy parametrizations, we establish sublinear convergence rates up to a function approximation error caused by restricted policy parametrization. We also provide convergence and finite-sample complexity guarantees for two sample-based NPG-PD algorithms. Finally, we use computational experiments to showcase the merits and the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Follow-up Attention: An Empirical Study of Developer and Neural Model Code Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent neural models of code, such as OpenAI Codex and AlphaCode, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency at code generation due to the underlying attention mechanism. However, it often remains unclear how the models actually process code, and to what extent their reasoning and the way their attention mechanism scans the code matches the patterns of developers. A poor understanding of the model reasoning process limits the way in which current neural models are leveraged today, so far mostly for their raw prediction. To fill this gap, this work studies how the processed attention signal of three open large language models - CodeGen, InCoder and GPT-J - agrees with how developers look at and explore code when each answers the same sensemaking questions about code. Furthermore, we contribute an open-source eye-tracking dataset comprising 92 manually-labeled sessions from 25 developers engaged in sensemaking tasks. We empirically evaluate five heuristics that do not use the attention and ten attention-based post-processing approaches of the attention signal of CodeGen against our ground truth of developers exploring code, including the novel concept of follow-up attention which exhibits the highest agreement between model and human attention. Our follow-up attention method can predict the next line a developer will look at with 47% accuracy. This outperforms the baseline prediction accuracy of 42.3%, which uses the session history of other developers to recommend the next line. These results demonstrate the potential of leveraging the attention signal of pre-trained models for effective code exploration.</description>

      <title>Unified Convergence Theory of Stochastic and Variance-Reduced Cubic Newton Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic Cubic Newton methods for solving general possibly non-convex minimization problems. We propose a new framework, which we call the helper framework, that provides a unified view of the stochastic and variance-reduced second-order algorithms equipped with global complexity guarantees. It can also be applied to learning with auxiliary information. Our helper framework offers the algorithm designer high flexibility for constructing and analyzing the stochastic Cubic Newton methods, allowing arbitrary size batches, and the use of noisy and possibly biased estimates of the gradients and Hessians, incorporating both the variance reduction and the lazy Hessian updates. We recover the best-known complexities for the stochastic and variance-reduced Cubic Newton, under weak assumptions on the noise. A direct consequence of our theory is the new lazy stochastic second-order method, which significantly improves the arithmetic complexity for large dimension problems. We also establish complexity bounds for the classes of gradient-dominated objectives, that include convex and strongly convex problems. For Auxiliary Learning, we show that using a helper (auxiliary function) can outperform training alone if a given similarity measure is small.</description>

      <title>A Normalized Bottleneck Distance on Persistence Diagrams and Homology Preservation under Dimension Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistence diagrams (PDs) are used as signatures of point cloud data. Two clouds of points can be compared using the bottleneck distance d_B between their PDs. A potential drawback of this pipeline is that point clouds sampled from topologically similar manifolds can have arbitrarily large d_B when there is a large scaling between them. This situation is typical in dimension reduction frameworks.
  We define, and study properties of, a new scale-invariant distance between PDs termed normalized bottleneck distance, d_N. In defining d_N, we develop a broader framework called metric decomposition for comparing finite metric spaces of equal cardinality with a bijection. We utilize metric decomposition to prove a stability result for d_N by deriving an explicit bound on the distortion of the bijective map. We then study two popular dimension reduction techniques, Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) projections and metric multidimensional scaling (mMDS), and a third class of general biLipschitz mappings. We provide new bounds on how well these dimension reduction techniques preserve homology with respect to d_N. For a JL map f that transforms input X to f(X), we show that d_N(dgm(X),dgm(f(X))) &lt; e, where dgm(X) is the Vietoris-Rips PD of X, and pairwise distances are preserved by f up to the tolerance 0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 1. For mMDS, we present new bounds for d_B and d_N between PDs of X and its projection in terms of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. And for k-biLipschitz maps, we show that d_N is bounded by the product of (k^2-1)/k and the ratio of diameters of X and f(X). Finally, we use computational experiments to demonstrate the increased effectiveness of using the normalized bottleneck distance for clustering sets of point clouds sampled from different shapes.</description>

Abstract: We propose a standardized version of fairness measures for continuous scores with a reasonable interpretation based on the Wasserstein distance. Our measures are easily computable and well suited for quantifying and interpreting the strength of group disparities as well as for comparing biases across different models, datasets, or time points. We derive a link between the different families of existing fairness measures for scores and show that the proposed standardized fairness measures outperform ROC-based fairness measures because they are more explicit and can quantify significant biases that ROC-based fairness measures miss.</description>

      <title>Iterative Methods for Vecchia-Laplace Approximations for Latent Gaussian Process Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Latent Gaussian process (GP) models are flexible probabilistic non-parametric function models. Vecchia approximations are accurate approximations for GPs to overcome computational bottlenecks for large data, and the Laplace approximation is a fast method with asymptotic convergence guarantees to approximate marginal likelihoods and posterior predictive distributions for non-Gaussian likelihoods. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of combined Vecchia-Laplace approximations grows faster than linearly in the sample size when used in combination with direct solver methods such as the Cholesky decomposition. Computations with Vecchia-Laplace approximations can thus become prohibitively slow precisely when the approximations are usually the most accurate, i.e., on large data sets. In this article, we present iterative methods to overcome this drawback. Among other things, we introduce and analyze several preconditioners, derive new convergence results, and propose novel methods for accurately approximating predictive variances. We analyze our proposed methods theoretically and in experiments with simulated and real-world data. In particular, we obtain a speed-up of an order of magnitude compared to Cholesky-based calculations and a threefold increase in prediction accuracy in terms of the continuous ranked probability score compared to a state-of-the-art method on a large satellite data set. All methods are implemented in a free C++ software library with high-level Python and R packages.</description>

      <title>1 From the Pursuit of Universal AGI Architecture to Systematic Approach to Heterogenous AGI: Addressing Alignment, Energy, &amp; AGI Grand Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI faces a trifecta of grand challenges: the Energy Wall, the Alignment Problem and the Leap from Narrow AI to AGI. Contemporary AI solutions consume unsustainable amounts of energy during model training and daily operations. Making things worse, the amount of computation required to train each new AI model has been doubling every 2 months since 2020, directly translating to unprecedented increases in energy consumption.
  The leap from AI to AGI requires multiple functional subsystems operating in a balanced manner, which requires a system architecture. However, the current approach to artificial intelligence lacks system design; even though system characteristics play a key role in the human brain; from the way it processes information to how it makes decisions. System design is the key to alignment, one of the most challenging goals in AI. This difficulty stems from the fact that the complexity of human moral system requires a similarly sophisticated system for alignment. Without accurately reflecting the complexity of these core moral subsystems and systems, aligning AI with human values becomes significantly more challenging.
  In this paper, we posit that system design is the missing piece in overcoming the grand challenges. We present a Systematic Approach to AGI that utilizes system design principles to AGI, while providing ways to overcome the energy wall and the alignment challenges. This paper asserts that artificial intelligence can be realized through a multiplicity of design-specific pathways, rather than a singular, overarching AGI architecture. AGI systems may exhibit diverse architectural configurations and capabilities, contingent upon their intended use cases. It advocates for a focus on employing system design principles as a guiding framework, rather than solely concentrating on a universal AGI architecture.</description>

      <title>DiffiT: Diffusion Vision Transformers for Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models with their powerful expressivity and high sample quality have achieved State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance in the generative domain. The pioneering Vision Transformer (ViT) has also demonstrated strong modeling capabilities and scalability, especially for recognition tasks. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of ViTs in diffusion-based generative learning and propose a new model denoted as Diffusion Vision Transformers (DiffiT). Specifically, we propose a methodology for finegrained control of the denoising process and introduce the Time-dependant Multihead Self Attention (TMSA) mechanism. DiffiT is surprisingly effective in generating high-fidelity images with significantly better parameter efficiency. We also propose latent and image space DiffiT models and show SOTA performance on a variety of class-conditional and unconditional synthesis tasks at different resolutions. The Latent DiffiT model achieves a new SOTA FID score of 1.73 on ImageNet256 dataset while having 19.85%, 16.88% less parameters than other Transformer-based diffusion models such as MDT and DiT,respectively.

      <title>On the Efficacy of Text-Based Input Modalities for Action Anticipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anticipating future actions is a highly challenging task due to the diversity and scale of potential future actions; yet, information from different modalities help narrow down plausible action choices. Each modality can provide diverse and often complementary context for the model to learn from. While previous multi-modal methods leverage information from modalities such as video and audio, we primarily explore how text descriptions of actions and objects can also lead to more accurate action anticipation by providing additional contextual cues, e.g., about the environment and its contents. We propose a Multi-modal Contrastive Anticipative Transformer (M-CAT), a video transformer architecture that jointly learns from multi-modal features and text descriptions of actions and objects. We train our model in two stages, where the model first learns to align video clips with descriptions of future actions, and is subsequently fine-tuned to predict future actions. Compared to existing methods, M-CAT has the advantage of learning additional context from two types of text inputs: rich descriptions of future actions during pre-training, and, text descriptions for detected objects and actions during modality feature fusion. Through extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that our model outperforms previous methods on the EpicKitchens datasets, and show that using simple text descriptions of actions and objects aid in more effective action anticipation. In addition, we examine the impact of object and action information obtained via text, and perform extensive ablations.</description>

      <title>A comparison between humans and AI at recognizing objects in unusual poses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning is closing the gap with human vision on several object recognition benchmarks. Here we investigate this gap for challenging images where objects are seen in unusual poses. We find that humans excel at recognizing objects in such poses. In contrast, state-of-the-art deep networks for vision (EfficientNet, SWAG, ViT, SWIN, BEiT, ConvNext) and state-of-the-art large vision-language models (Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5, GPT-4) are systematically brittle on unusual poses, with the exception of Gemini showing excellent robustness in that condition. As we limit image exposure time, human performance degrades to the level of deep networks, suggesting that additional mental processes (requiring additional time) are necessary to identify objects in unusual poses. An analysis of error patterns of humans vs. networks reveals that even time-limited humans are dissimilar to feed-forward deep networks. In conclusion, our comparison reveals that humans and deep networks rely on different mechanisms for recognizing objects in unusual poses. Understanding the nature of the mental processes taking place during extra viewing time may be key to reproduce the robustness of human vision in silico.</description>

      <title>PsychoGAT: A Novel Psychological Measurement Paradigm through Interactive Fiction Games with LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Psychological measurement is essential for mental health, self-understanding, and personal development. Traditional methods, such as self-report scales and psychologist interviews, often face challenges with engagement and accessibility. While game-based and LLM-based tools have been explored to improve user interest and automate assessment, they struggle to balance engagement with generalizability. In this work, we propose PsychoGAT (Psychological Game AgenTs) to achieve a generic gamification of psychological assessment. The main insight is that powerful LLMs can function both as adept psychologists and innovative game designers. By incorporating LLM agents into designated roles and carefully managing their interactions, PsychoGAT can transform any standardized scales into personalized and engaging interactive fiction games. To validate the proposed method, we conduct psychometric evaluations to assess its effectiveness and employ human evaluators to examine the generated content across various psychological constructs, including depression, cognitive distortions, and personality traits. Results demonstrate that PsychoGAT serves as an effective assessment tool, achieving statistically significant excellence in psychometric metrics such as reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. Moreover, human evaluations confirm PsychoGAT's enhancements in content coherence, interactivity, interest, immersion, and satisfaction.</description>

      <title>Communication Optimization for Distributed Training: Architecture, Advances, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The past few years have witnessed the flourishing of large-scale deep neural network models with ever-growing parameter numbers. Training such large-scale models typically requires massive memory and computing resources, necessitating distributed training. As GPU performance has rapidly evolved in recent years, computation time has shrunk, making communication a larger portion of the overall training time. Consequently, optimizing communication for distributed training has become crucial. In this article, we briefly introduce the general architecture of distributed deep neural network training and analyze relationships among Parallelization Strategy, Collective Communication Library, and Network from the perspective of communication optimization, which forms a three-layer paradigm. We then review current representative research advances within this three-layer paradigm. We find that layers in the current three-layer paradigm are relatively independent and there is a rich design space for cross-layer collaborative optimization in distributed training scenarios. Therefore, we advocate "Vertical" and "Horizontal" co-designs which extend the three-layer paradigm to a five-layer paradigm. We also advocate "Intra-Inter" and "Host-Net" co-designs to further utilize the potential of heterogeneous resources. We hope this article can shed some light on future research on communication optimization for distributed training.</description>

      <title>Evaluation Framework for Feedback Generation Methods in Skeletal Movement Assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09359v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of machine-learning solutions to movement assessment from skeleton videos has attracted significant research attention in recent years. This advancement has made rehabilitation at home more accessible, utilizing movement assessment algorithms that can operate on affordable equipment for human pose detection and analysis from 2D or 3D videos. While the primary objective of automatic assessment tasks is to score movements, the automatic generation of feedback highlighting key movement issues has the potential to significantly enhance and accelerate the rehabilitation process. While numerous research works exist in the field of automatic movement assessment, only a handful address feedback generation. In this study, we propose terminology and criteria for the classification, evaluation, and comparison of feedback generation solutions. We discuss the challenges associated with each feedback generation approach and use our proposed criteria to classify existing solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first work that formulates feedback generation in skeletal movement assessment.</description>

      <title>A Guide to Feature Importance Methods for Scientific Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used due to their high predictive power, their use in understanding the data-generating process (DGP) is limited. Understanding the DGP requires insights into feature-target associations, which many ML models cannot directly provide due to their opaque internal mechanisms. Feature importance (FI) methods provide useful insights into the DGP under certain conditions. Since the results of different FI methods have different interpretations, selecting the correct FI method for a concrete use case is crucial and still requires expert knowledge. This paper serves as a comprehensive guide to help understand the different interpretations of global FI methods. Through an extensive review of FI methods and providing new proofs regarding their interpretation, we facilitate a thorough understanding of these methods and formulate concrete recommendations for scientific inference. We conclude by discussing options for FI uncertainty estimation and point to directions for future research aiming at full statistical inference from black-box ML models.</description>

      <title>Gameplay Filters: Robust Zero-Shot Safety through Adversarial Imagination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the impressive recent advances in learning-based robot control, ensuring robustness to out-of-distribution conditions remains an open challenge. Safety filters can, in principle, keep arbitrary control policies from incurring catastrophic failures by overriding unsafe actions, but existing solutions for complex (e.g., legged) robot dynamics do not span the full motion envelope and instead rely on local, reduced-order models. These filters tend to overly restrict agility and can still fail when perturbed away from nominal conditions. This paper presents the gameplay filter, a new class of predictive safety filter that continually plays out hypothetical matches between its simulation-trained safety strategy and a virtual adversary co-trained to invoke worst-case events and sim-to-real error, and precludes actions that would cause it to fail down the line. We demonstrate the scalability and robustness of the approach with a first-of-its-kind full-order safety filter for (36-D) quadrupedal dynamics. Physical experiments on two different quadruped platforms demonstrate the superior zero-shot effectiveness of the gameplay filter under large perturbations such as tugging and unmodeled terrain.</description>

      <title>Batched Stochastic Bandit for Nondegenerate Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies batched bandit learning problems for nondegenerate functions. We introduce an algorithm that solves the batched bandit problem for nondegenerate functions near-optimally. More specifically, we introduce an algorithm, called Geometric Narrowing (GN), whose regret bound is of order $\widetilde{{\mathcal{O}}} ( A_{+}^d \sqrt{T} )$. In addition, GN only needs $\mathcal{O} (\log \log T)$ batches to achieve this regret. We also provide lower bound analysis for this problem. More specifically, we prove that over some (compact) doubling metric space of doubling dimension $d$: 1. For any policy $\pi$, there exists a problem instance on which $\pi$ admits a regret of order ${\Omega} ( A_-^d \sqrt{T})$; 2. No policy can achieve a regret of order $ A_-^d \sqrt{T} $ over all problem instances, using less than $ \Omega ( \log \log T ) $ rounds of communications. Our lower bound analysis shows that the GN algorithm achieves near optimal regret with minimal number of batches.</description>

      <title>Erasing Concepts from Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Few-shot Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating images from text has become easier because of the scaling of diffusion models and advancements in the field of vision and language. These models are trained using vast amounts of data from the Internet. Hence, they often contain undesirable content such as copyrighted material. As it is challenging to remove such data and retrain the models, methods for erasing specific concepts from pre-trained models have been investigated. We propose a novel concept-erasure method that updates the text encoder using few-shot unlearning in which a few real images are used. The discussion regarding the generated images after erasing a concept has been lacking. While there are methods for specifying the transition destination for concepts, the validity of the specified concepts is unclear. Our method implicitly achieves this by transitioning to the latent concepts inherent in the model or the images. Our method can erase a concept within 10 s, making concept erasure more accessible than ever before. Implicitly transitioning to related concepts leads to more natural concept erasure. We applied the proposed method to various concepts and confirmed that concept erasure can be achieved tens to hundreds of times faster than with current methods. By varying the parameters to be updated, we obtained results suggesting that, like previous research, knowledge is primarily accumulated in the feed-forward networks of the text encoder. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/fmp453/few-shot-erasing}</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Gradient Boosting: A Framework for Distribution-Valued Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient boosting is a sequential ensemble method that fits a new weaker learner to pseudo residuals at each iteration. We propose Wasserstein gradient boosting, a novel extension of gradient boosting that fits a new weak learner to alternative pseudo residuals that are Wasserstein gradients of loss functionals of probability distributions assigned at each input. It solves distribution-valued supervised learning, where the output values of the training dataset are probability distributions for each input. In classification and regression, a model typically returns, for each input, a point estimate of a parameter of a noise distribution specified for a response variable, such as the class probability parameter of a categorical distribution specified for a response label. A main application of Wasserstein gradient boosting in this paper is tree-based evidential learning, which returns a distributional estimate of the response parameter for each input. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of the probabilistic prediction by Wasserstein gradient boosting in comparison with existing uncertainty quantification methods.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Forecasting through Low-Rank Adaptation of Discrete Latent Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trajectory forecasting is crucial for video surveillance analytics, as it enables the anticipation of future movements for a set of agents, e.g. basketball players engaged in intricate interactions with long-term intentions. Deep generative models offer a natural learning approach for trajectory forecasting, yet they encounter difficulties in achieving an optimal balance between sampling fidelity and diversity. We address this challenge by leveraging Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), which utilize a discrete latent space to tackle the issue of posterior collapse. Specifically, we introduce an instance-based codebook that allows tailored latent representations for each example. In a nutshell, the rows of the codebook are dynamically adjusted to reflect contextual information (i.e., past motion patterns extracted from the observed trajectories). In this way, the discretization process gains flexibility, leading to improved reconstructions. Notably, instance-level dynamics are injected into the codebook through low-rank updates, which restrict the customization of the codebook to a lower dimension space. The resulting discrete space serves as the basis of the subsequent step, which regards the training of a diffusion-based predictive model. We show that such a two-fold framework, augmented with instance-level discretization, leads to accurate and diverse forecasts, yielding state-of-the-art performance on three established benchmarks.</description>

      <title>CityLight: A Universal Model for Coordinated Traffic Signal Control in City-scale Heterogeneous Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasingly severe congestion problem in modern cities strengthens the significance of developing city-scale traffic signal control (TSC) methods for traffic efficiency enhancement. While reinforcement learning has been widely explored in TSC, most of them still target small-scale optimization and cannot directly scale to the city level due to unbearable resource demand. Only a few of them manage to tackle city-level optimization, namely a thousand-scale optimization, by incorporating parameter-sharing mechanisms, but hardly have they fully tackled the heterogeneity of intersections and intricate between-intersection interactions inherent in real-world city road networks. To fill in the gap, we target at the two important challenges in adopting parameter-sharing paradigms to solve TSC: inconsistency of inner state representations for intersections heterogeneous in configuration, scale, and orders of available traffic phases; intricacy of impacts from neighborhood intersections that have various relative traffic relationships due to inconsistent phase orders and diverse relative positioning. Our method, CityLight, features a universal representation module that not only aligns the state representations of intersections by reindexing their phases based on their semantics and designing heterogeneity-preserving observations, but also encodes the narrowed relative traffic relation types to project the neighborhood intersections onto a uniform relative traffic impact space. We further attentively fuse neighborhood representations based on their competing relations and incorporate neighborhood-integrated rewards to boost coordination. Extensive experiments with hundreds to tens of thousands of intersections validate the surprising effectiveness and generalizability of CityLight, with an overall performance gain of 11.68% and a 22.59% improvement in transfer scenarios in throughput.</description>

      <title>Can Synthetic Audio From Generative Foundation Models Assist Audio Recognition and Speech Modeling?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have enabled audio-generative models that produce high-fidelity sounds associated with music, events, and human actions. Despite the success achieved in modern audio-generative models, the conventional approach to assessing the quality of the audio generation relies heavily on distance metrics like Frechet Audio Distance. In contrast, we aim to evaluate the quality of audio generation by examining the effectiveness of using them as training data. Specifically, we conduct studies to explore the use of synthetic audio for audio recognition. Moreover, we investigate whether synthetic audio can serve as a resource for data augmentation in speech-related modeling. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the potential of using synthetic audio for audio recognition and speech-related modeling.

      <title>Conditional score-based diffusion models for solving inverse problems in mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to perform Bayesian inference using conditional score-based diffusion models to solve a class of inverse problems in mechanics involving the inference of a specimen's spatially varying material properties from noisy measurements of its mechanical response to loading. Conditional score-based diffusion models are generative models that learn to approximate the score function of a conditional distribution using samples from the joint distribution. More specifically, the score functions corresponding to multiple realizations of the measurement are approximated using a single neural network, the so-called score network, which is subsequently used to sample the posterior distribution using an appropriate Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme based on Langevin dynamics. Training the score network only requires simulating the forward model. Hence, the proposed approach can accommodate black-box forward models and complex measurement noise. Moreover, once the score network has been trained, it can be re-used to solve the inverse problem for different realizations of the measurements. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on a suite of high-dimensional inverse problems in mechanics that involve inferring heterogeneous material properties from noisy measurements. Some examples we consider involve synthetic data, while others include data collected from actual elastography experiments. Further, our applications demonstrate that the proposed approach can handle different measurement modalities, complex patterns in the inferred quantities, non-Gaussian and non-additive noise models, and nonlinear black-box forward models. The results show that the proposed framework can solve large-scale physics-based inverse problems efficiently.</description>

      <title>Not (yet) the whole story: Evaluating Visual Storytelling Requires More than Measuring Coherence, Grounding, and Repetition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual storytelling consists in generating a natural language story given a temporally ordered sequence of images. This task is not only challenging for models, but also very difficult to evaluate with automatic metrics since there is no consensus about what makes a story 'good'. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that measures story quality in terms of human likeness regarding three key aspects highlighted in previous work: visual grounding, coherence, and repetitiveness. We then use this method to evaluate the stories generated by several models, showing that the foundation model LLaVA obtains the best result, but only slightly so compared to TAPM, a 50-times smaller visual storytelling model. Upgrading the visual and language components of TAPM results in a model that yields competitive performance with a relatively low number of parameters. Finally, we carry out a human evaluation study, whose results suggest that a 'good' story may require more than a human-like level of visual grounding, coherence, and repetition.</description>

      <title>The $\mu\mathcal{G}$ Language for Programming Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks form a class of deep learning architectures specifically designed to work with graph-structured data. As such, they share the inherent limitations and problems of deep learning, especially regarding the issues of explainability and trustworthiness. We propose $\mu\mathcal{G}$, an original domain-specific language for the specification of graph neural networks that aims to overcome these issues. The language's syntax is introduced, and its meaning is rigorously defined by a denotational semantics. An equivalent characterization in the form of an operational semantics is also provided and, together with a type system, is used to prove the type soundness of $\mu\mathcal{G}$. We show how $\mu\mathcal{G}$ programs can be represented in a more user-friendly graphical visualization, and provide examples of its generality by showing how it can be used to define some of the most popular graph neural network models, or to develop any custom graph processing application.</description>

      <title>VGBench: Evaluating Large Language Models on Vector Graphics Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of vision models, the primary mode of representation is using pixels to rasterize the visual world. Yet this is not always the best or unique way to represent visual content, especially for designers and artists who depict the world using geometry primitives such as polygons. Vector graphics (VG), on the other hand, offer a textual representation of visual content, which can be more concise and powerful for content like cartoons, sketches and scientific figures. Recent studies have shown promising results on processing vector graphics with capable Large Language Models (LLMs). However, such works focus solely on qualitative results, understanding, or a specific type of vector graphics. We propose VGBench, a comprehensive benchmark for LLMs on handling vector graphics through diverse aspects, including (a) both visual understanding and generation, (b) evaluation of various vector graphics formats, (c) diverse question types, (d) wide range of prompting techniques, (e) under multiple LLMs and (f) comparison with VLMs on rasterized representations. Evaluating on our collected 4279 understanding and 5845 generation samples, we find that LLMs show strong capability on both aspects while exhibiting less desirable performance on low-level formats (SVG). Both data and evaluation pipeline will be open-sourced at https://vgbench.github.io.</description>

      <title>Innovative Speech-Based Deep Learning Approaches for Parkinson's Disease Classification: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, frequently presents with early-stage speech impairments. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning (DL), have significantly enhanced PD diagnosis through the analysis of speech data. Nevertheless, the progress of research is restricted by the limited availability of publicly accessible speech-based PD datasets, primarily due to privacy concerns. The goal of this systematic review is to explore the current landscape of speech-based DL approaches for PD classification, based on 33 scientific works published between 2020 and March 2024. We discuss their available resources, capabilities, potential limitations, and issues related to bias, explainability, and privacy. Furthermore, this review provides an overview of publicly accessible speech-based datasets and open-source material for PD. The DL approaches are categorized into end-to-end (E2E) learning, transfer learning (TL) and deep acoustic features extraction (DAFE) approaches. Among E2E approaches, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are prevalent, though Transformers are increasingly popular. E2E approaches face challenges such as limited data and computational resources, especially with Transformers. TL addresses these issues by providing more robust PD diagnosis and better generalizability across languages. DAFE aims to improve the explainability and interpretability of results by examining the specific effects of deep features on both other DL approaches and more traditional machine learning (ML) methods. However, it often underperforms compared to E2E and TL approaches.</description>

      <title>LaMAGIC: Language-Model-based Topology Generation for Analog Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of electronic and electrical engineering, automation of analog circuit is increasingly vital given the complexity and customized requirements of modern applications. However, existing methods only develop search-based algorithms that require many simulation iterations to design a custom circuit topology, which is usually a time-consuming process. To this end, we introduce LaMAGIC, a pioneering language model-based topology generation model that leverages supervised finetuning for automated analog circuit design. LaMAGIC can efficiently generate an optimized circuit design from the custom specification in a single pass. Our approach involves a meticulous development and analysis of various input and output formulations for circuit. These formulations can ensure canonical representations of circuits and align with the autoregressive nature of LMs to effectively addressing the challenges of representing analog circuits as graphs. The experimental results show that LaMAGIC achieves a success rate of up to 96\% under a strict tolerance of 0.01. We also examine the scalability and adaptability of LaMAGIC, specifically testing its performance on more complex circuits. Our findings reveal the enhanced effectiveness of our adjacency matrix-based circuit formulation with floating-point input, suggesting its suitability for handling intricate circuit designs. This research not only demonstrates the potential of language models in graph generation, but also builds a foundational framework for future explorations in automated analog circuit design.</description>

      <title>GenRec: Generative Sequential Recommendation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation is a task to capture hidden user preferences from historical user item interaction data and recommend next items for the user. Significant progress has been made in this domain by leveraging classification based learning methods. Inspired by the recent paradigm of 'pretrain, prompt and predict' in NLP, we consider sequential recommendation as a sequence to sequence generation task and propose a novel model named Generative Recommendation (GenRec). Unlike classification based models that learn explicit user and item representations, GenRec utilizes the sequence modeling capability of Transformer and adopts the masked item prediction objective to effectively learn the hidden bidirectional sequential patterns. Different from existing generative sequential recommendation models, GenRec does not rely on manually designed hard prompts. The input to GenRec is textual user item sequence and the output is top ranked next items. Moreover, GenRec is lightweight and requires only a few hours to train effectively in low-resource settings, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios and helping to democratize large language models in the sequential recommendation domain. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that GenRec generalizes on various public real-world datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results. Our experiments also validate the effectiveness of the the proposed masked item prediction objective that improves the model performance by a large margin.</description>

      <title>Matmul or No Matmal in the Era of 1-bit LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of 1-bit large language models (LLMs) has attracted considerable attention and opened up new research opportunities. However, 1-bit LLMs only improve a fraction of models by applying extreme quantization to the projection layers while leaving attention heads unchanged. Therefore, to avoid fundamentally wrong choices of goals in future research, it is crucial to understand the actual improvements in computation and memory usage that 1-bit LLMs can deliver. In this work, we present an adaptation of Amdahl's Law tailored for the 1-bit LLM context, which illustrates how partial improvements in 1-bit LLMs impact overall model performance. Through extensive experiments, we uncover key nuances across different model architectures and hardware configurations, offering a roadmap for future research in the era of 1-bit LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation models have made significant strides, producing outputs with improved visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and user control. These advancements hold great promise for improving surgical education by enabling more realistic, diverse, and interactive simulation environments. In this study, we introduce SurGen, a text-guided diffusion model tailored for surgical video synthesis, producing the highest resolution and longest duration videos among existing surgical video generation models. We validate the visual and temporal quality of the outputs using standard image and video generation metrics. Additionally, we assess their alignment to the corresponding text prompts through a deep learning classifier trained on surgical data. Our results demonstrate the potential of diffusion models to serve as valuable educational tools for surgical trainees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition to renewable energy, particularly solar, is key to mitigating climate change. Google's Solar API aids this transition by estimating solar potential from aerial imagery, but its impact is constrained by geographical coverage. This paper proposes expanding the API's reach using satellite imagery, enabling global solar potential assessment. We tackle challenges involved in building a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and roof instance segmentation from lower resolution and single oblique views using deep learning models. Our models, trained on aligned satellite and aerial datasets, produce 25cm DSMs and roof segments. With ~1m DSM MAE on buildings, ~5deg roof pitch error and ~56% IOU on roof segmentation, they significantly enhance the Solar API's potential to promote solar adoption.</description>

      <title>MMASD+: A Novel Dataset for Privacy-Preserving Behavior Analysis of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by significant challenges in social interaction and comprehending communication signals. Recently, therapeutic interventions for ASD have increasingly utilized Deep learning powered-computer vision techniques to monitor individual progress over time. These models are trained on private, non-public datasets from the autism community, creating challenges in comparing results across different models due to privacy-preserving data-sharing issues. This work introduces MMASD+, an enhanced version of the novel open-source dataset called Multimodal ASD (MMASD). MMASD+ consists of diverse data modalities, including 3D-Skeleton, 3D Body Mesh, and Optical Flow data. It integrates the capabilities of Yolov8 and Deep SORT algorithms to distinguish between the therapist and children, addressing a significant barrier in the original dataset. Additionally, a Multimodal Transformer framework is proposed to predict 11 action types and the presence of ASD. This framework achieves an accuracy of 95.03% for predicting action types and 96.42% for predicting ASD presence, demonstrating over a 10% improvement compared to models trained on single data modalities. These findings highlight the advantages of integrating multiple data modalities within the Multimodal Transformer framework.</description>

      <title>Force-Guided Bridge Matching for Full-Atom Time-Coarsened Dynamics of Peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are irreplaceable and ubiquitous in fields of materials science, chemistry, pharmacology just to name a few. Conventional MD simulations are plagued by numerical stability as well as long equilibration time issues, which limits broader applications of MD simulations. Recently, a surge of deep learning approaches have been devised for time-coarsened dynamics, which learns the state transition mechanism over much larger time scales to overcome these limitations. However, only a few methods target the underlying Boltzmann distribution by resampling techniques, where proposals are rarely accepted as new states with low efficiency. In this work, we propose a force-guided bridge matching model, FBM, a novel framework that first incorporates physical priors into bridge matching for full-atom time-coarsened dynamics. With the guidance of our well-designed intermediate force field, FBM is feasible to target the Boltzmann-like distribution by direct inference without extra steps. Experiments on small peptides verify our superiority in terms of comprehensive metrics and demonstrate transferability to unseen peptide systems.</description>
