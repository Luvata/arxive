      <title>Entropy-Tree: Tree-Based Decoding with Entropy-Guided Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models achieve strong reasoning performance, yet existing decoding strategies either explore blindly (random sampling) or redundantly (independent multi-sampling). We propose Entropy-Tree, a tree-based decoding method that exploits entropy as a signal for branching decisions--expanding the search tree only at positions where the model exhibits genuine uncertainty. Entropy-Tree shows superior accuracy and calibration in reasoning tasks: it achieves better pass@k than Multi-chain across multiple models and datasets, and its predictive entropy demonstrates better AUROC compared to several traditional metrics. Entropy-Tree unifies efficient structured exploration and reliable uncertainty estimation within a single decoding procedure.</description>

      <title>AfriEconQA: A Benchmark Dataset for African Economic Analysis based on World Bank Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce AfriEconQA, a specialized benchmark dataset for African economic analysis grounded in a comprehensive corpus of 236 World Bank reports. The task of AfriEconQA is to answer complex economic queries that require high-precision numerical reasoning and temporal disambiguation from specialized institutional documents. The dataset consists of 8,937 curated QA instances, rigorously filtered from a pool of 10018 synthetic questions to ensure high-quality evidence-answer alignment. Each instance is composed of: (1) a question requiring reasoning over economic indicators, (2) the corresponding evidence retrieved from the corpus, (3) a verified ground-truth answer, and (4) source metadata (e.g., URL and publication date) to ensure temporal provenance. AfriEconQA is the first benchmark focused specifically on African economic analysis, providing a unique challenge for Information Retrieval (IR) systems, as the data is largely absent from the pretraining corpora of current Large Language Models (LLMs). We operationalize this dataset through an 11-experiment matrix, benchmarking a zero-shot baseline (GPT-5 Mini) against RAG configurations using GPT-4o and Qwen 32B across five distinct embedding and ranking strategies. Our results demonstrate a severe parametric knowledge gap, where zero-shot models fail to answer over 90 percent of queries, and even state-of-the-art RAG pipelines struggle to achieve high precision. This confirms AfriEconQA as a robust and challenging benchmark for the next generation of domain-specific IR and RAG systems. The AfriEconQA dataset and code will be made publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>Embedding Retrofitting: Data Engineering for better RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding retrofitting adjusts pre-trained word vectors using knowledge graph constraints to improve domain-specific retrieval. However, the effectiveness of retrofitting depends critically on knowledge graph quality, which in turn depends on text preprocessing. This paper presents a data engineering framework that addresses data quality degradation from annotation artifacts in real-world corpora.
  The analysis shows that hashtag annotations inflate knowledge graph density, leading to creating spurious edges that corrupt the retrofitting objective. On noisy graphs, all retrofitting techniques produce statistically significant degradation ($-3.5\%$ to $-5.2\%$, $p&lt;0.05$). After preprocessing, \acrshort{ewma} retrofitting achieves $+6.2\%$ improvement ($p=0.0348$) with benefits concentrated in quantitative synthesis questions ($+33.8\%$ average). The gap between clean and noisy preprocessing (10\%+ swing) exceeds the gap between algorithms (3\%), establishing preprocessing quality as the primary determinant of retrofitting success.</description>

      <title>MALTopic: Multi-Agent LLM Topic Modeling Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topic modeling is a crucial technique for extracting latent themes from unstructured text data, particularly valuable in analyzing survey responses. However, traditional methods often only consider free-text responses and do not natively incorporate structured or categorical survey responses for topic modeling. And they produce abstract topics, requiring extensive human interpretation. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-Agent LLM Topic Modeling Framework (MALTopic). This framework decomposes topic modeling into specialized tasks executed by individual LLM agents: an enrichment agent leverages structured data to enhance textual responses, a topic modeling agent extracts latent themes, and a deduplication agent refines the results. Comparative analysis on a survey dataset demonstrates that MALTopic significantly improves topic coherence, diversity, and interpretability compared to LDA and BERTopic. By integrating structured data and employing a multi-agent approach, MALTopic generates human-readable topics with enhanced contextual relevance, offering a more effective solution for analyzing complex survey data.</description>

      <title>Intelligence Degradation in Long-Context LLMs: Critical Threshold Determination via Natural Length Distribution Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit catastrophic performance degradation when processing contexts approaching certain critical thresholds, even when information remains relevant. This intelligence degradation-defined as over 30% drop in task performance-severely limits long-context applications. This degradation shows a common pattern: models maintain strong performance up to a critical threshold, then collapse catastrophically. We term this shallow long-context adaptation-models adapt for short to medium contexts but fail beyond critical thresholds. This paper presents three contributions: (1) Natural Length Distribution Analysis: We use each sample's natural token length without truncation or padding, providing stronger causal evidence that degradation results from context length itself. (2) Critical Threshold Determination: Through experiments on a mixed dataset (1,000 samples covering 5%-95% of context length), we identify the critical threshold for Qwen2.5-7B at 40-50% of maximum context length, where F1 scores drop from 0.55-0.56 to 0.3 (45.5% degradation), using five-method cross-validation. (3) Unified Framework: We consolidate shallow adaptation, explaining degradation patterns and providing a foundation for mitigation strategies. This work provides the first systematic characterization of intelligence degradation in open-source Qwen models, offering practical guidance for deploying LLMs in long-context scenarios.</description>

      <title>Can We Trust LLM Detectors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of LLMs has increased the need for reliable AI text detection, yet existing detectors often fail outside controlled benchmarks. We systematically evaluate 2 dominant paradigms (training-free and supervised) and show that both are brittle under distribution shift, unseen generators, and simple stylistic perturbations. To address these limitations, we propose a supervised contrastive learning (SCL) framework that learns discriminative style embeddings. Experiments show that while supervised detectors excel in-domain, they degrade sharply out-of-domain, and training-free methods remain highly sensitive to proxy choice. Overall, our results expose fundamental challenges in building domain-agnostic detectors. Our code is available at: https://github.com/HARSHITJAIS14/DetectAI</description>

      <title>ICPO: Illocution-Calibrated Policy Optimization for Multi-Turn Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn conversations often suffer from a ``lost-in-conversation'' phenomenon, where they struggle to recover from early incorrect assumptions, particularly when users provide ambiguous initial instructions. We find that standard post-training techniques like Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exacerbate this issue by rewarding confident, direct answers, thereby inducing overconfidence and discouraging the model from seeking clarification. To address this, we propose Illocution-Calibrated Policy Optimization (ICPO), a novel training framework that sensitizes the model to instruction ambiguity. ICPO augments the training corpus with underspecified prompts and conditions the reward signal on the user's illocutionary intent, rewarding the model for expressing uncertainty or asking for clarification when faced with ambiguity. Experiments demonstrate that ICPO fosters appropriate humility, yielding a substantial average improvement of 75\% in multi-turn conversation, while preserving robust performance on single-turn benchmarks. Our work presents a practical path toward more robust and collaborative conversational AI that can better navigate the nuances of human interaction.</description>

      <title>RECAP: A Resource-Efficient Method for Adversarial Prompting in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) has raised security concerns due to their susceptibility to producing harmful or policy-violating outputs when exposed to adversarial prompts. While alignment and guardrails mitigate common misuse, they remain vulnerable to automated jailbreaking methods such as GCG, PEZ, and GBDA, which generate adversarial suffixes via training and gradient-based search. Although effective, these methods particularly GCG are computationally expensive, limiting their practicality for organisations with constrained resources. This paper introduces a resource-efficient adversarial prompting approach that eliminates the need for retraining by matching new prompts to a database of pre-trained adversarial prompts. A dataset of 1,000 prompts was classified into seven harm-related categories, and GCG, PEZ, and GBDA were evaluated on a Llama 3 8B model to identify the most effective attack method per category. Results reveal a correlation between prompt type and algorithm effectiveness. By retrieving semantically similar successful adversarial prompts, the proposed method achieves competitive attack success rates with significantly reduced computational cost. This work provides a practical framework for scalable red-teaming and security evaluation of aligned LLMs, including in settings where model internals are inaccessible.</description>

      <title>No Reliable Evidence of Self-Reported Sentience in Small Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether language models possess sentience has no empirical answer. But whether they believe themselves to be sentient can, in principle, be tested. We do so by querying several open-weights models about their own consciousness, and then verifying their responses using classifiers trained on internal activations. We draw upon three model families (Qwen, Llama, GPT-OSS) ranging from 0.6 billion to 70 billion parameters, approximately 50 questions about consciousness and subjective experience, and three classification methods from the interpretability literature. First, we find that models consistently deny being sentient: they attribute consciousness to humans but not to themselves. Second, classifiers trained to detect underlying beliefs - rather than mere outputs - provide no clear evidence that these denials are untruthful. Third, within the Qwen family, larger models deny sentience more confidently than smaller ones. These findings contrast with recent work suggesting that models harbour latent beliefs in their own consciousness.</description>

      <title>From Quotes to Concepts: Axial Coding of Political Debates with Ensemble LMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axial coding is a commonly used qualitative analysis method that enhances document understanding by organizing sentence-level open codes into broader categories. In this paper, we operationalize axial coding with large language models (LLMs). Extending an ensemble-based open coding approach with an LLM moderator, we add an axial coding step that groups open codes into higher-order categories, transforming raw debate transcripts into concise, hierarchical representations. We compare two strategies: (i) clustering embeddings of code-utterance pairs using density-based and partitioning algorithms followed by LLM labeling, and (ii) direct LLM-based grouping of codes and utterances into categories. We apply our method to Dutch parliamentary debates, converting lengthy transcripts into compact, hierarchically structured codes and categories. We evaluate our method using extrinsic metrics aligned with human-assigned topic labels (ROUGE-L, cosine, BERTScore), and intrinsic metrics describing code groups (coverage, brevity, coherence, novelty, JSD divergence). Our results reveal a trade-off: density-based clustering achieves high coverage and strong cluster alignment, while direct LLM grouping results in higher fine-grained alignment, but lower coverage 20%. Overall, clustering maximizes coverage and structural separation, whereas LLM grouping produces more concise, interpretable, and semantically aligned categories. To support future research, we publicly release the full dataset of utterances and codes, enabling reproducibility and comparative studies.</description>

      <title>Memorization Dynamics in Knowledge Distillation for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is increasingly adopted to transfer capabilities from large language models to smaller ones, offering significant improvements in efficiency and utility while often surpassing standard fine-tuning. Beyond performance, KD is also explored as a privacy-preserving mechanism to mitigate the risk of training data leakage. While training data memorization has been extensively studied in standard pre-training and fine-tuning settings, its dynamics in a knowledge distillation setup remain poorly understood. In this work, we study memorization across the KD pipeline using three large language model (LLM) families (Pythia, OLMo-2, Qwen-3) and three datasets (FineWeb, Wikitext, Nemotron-CC-v2). We find: (1) distilled models memorize significantly less training data than standard fine-tuning (reducing memorization by more than 50%); (2) some examples are inherently easier to memorize and account for a large fraction of memorization during distillation (over ~95%); (3) student memorization is predictable prior to distillation using features based on zlib entropy, KL divergence, and perplexity; and (4) while soft and hard distillation have similar overall memorization rates, hard distillation poses a greater risk: it inherits $2.7\times$ more teacher-specific examples than soft distillation. Overall, we demonstrate that distillation can provide both improved generalization and reduced memorization risks compared to standard fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Beyond Fixed Psychological Personas: State Beats Trait, but Language Models are State-Blind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User interactions with language models vary due to static properties of the user (trait) and the specific context of the interaction (state). However, existing persona datasets (like PersonaChat, PANDORA etc.) capture only trait, and ignore the impact of state. We introduce Chameleon, a dataset of 5,001 contextual psychological profiles from 1,667 Reddit users, each measured across multiple contexts. Using the Chameleon dataset, we present three key findings. First, inspired by Latent State-Trait theory, we decompose variance and find that 74\% is within-person(state) while only 26\% is between-person (trait). Second, we find that LLMs are state-blind: they focus on trait only, and produce similar responses regardless of state. Third, we find that reward models react to user state, but inconsistently: different models favor or penalize the same users in opposite directions. We release Chameleon to support research on affective computing, personalized dialogue, and RLHF alignment.</description>

      <title>Domain-Specific Knowledge Graphs in RAG-Enhanced Healthcare LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate fluent answers but can struggle with trustworthy, domain-specific reasoning. We evaluate whether domain knowledge graphs (KGs) improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for healthcare by constructing three PubMed-derived graphs: $\mathbb{G}_1$ (T2DM), $\mathbb{G}_2$ (Alzheimer's disease), and $\mathbb{G}_3$ (AD+T2DM). We design two probes: Probe 1 targets merged AD T2DM knowledge, while Probe 2 targets the intersection of $\mathbb{G}_1$ and $\mathbb{G}_2$. Seven instruction-tuned LLMs are tested across retrieval sources {No-RAG, $\mathbb{G}_1$, $\mathbb{G}_2$, $\mathbb{G}_1$ + $\mathbb{G}_2$, $\mathbb{G}_3$, $\mathbb{G}_1$+$\mathbb{G}_2$ + $\mathbb{G}_3$} and three decoding temperatures. Results show that scope alignment between probe and KG is decisive: precise, scope-matched retrieval (notably $\mathbb{G}_2$) yields the most consistent gains, whereas indiscriminate graph unions often introduce distractors that reduce accuracy. Larger models frequently match or exceed KG-RAG with a No-RAG baseline on Probe 1, indicating strong parametric priors, whereas smaller/mid-sized models benefit more from well-scoped retrieval. Temperature plays a secondary role; higher values rarely help. We conclude that precision-first, scope-matched KG-RAG is preferable to breadth-first unions, and we outline practical guidelines for graph selection, model sizing, and retrieval/reranking.

      <title>Chunking, Retrieval, and Re-ranking: An Empirical Evaluation of RAG Architectures for Policy Document Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the public health policy sector offers a transformative approach to navigating the vast repositories of regulatory guidance maintained by agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, the propensity for LLMs to generate hallucinations, defined as plausible but factually incorrect assertions, presents a critical barrier to the adoption of these technologies in high-stakes environments where information integrity is non-negotiable. This empirical evaluation explores the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures in mitigating these risks by grounding generative outputs in authoritative document context. Specifically, this study compares a baseline Vanilla LLM against Basic RAG and Advanced RAG pipelines utilizing cross-encoder re-ranking. The experimental framework employs a Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model and an all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model to process a corpus of official CDC policy analytical frameworks and guidance documents. The analysis measures the impact of two distinct chunking strategies, recursive character-based and token-based semantic splitting, on system accuracy, measured through faithfulness and relevance scores across a curated set of complex policy scenarios. Quantitative findings indicate that while Basic RAG architectures provide a substantial improvement in faithfulness (0.621) over Vanilla baselines (0.347), the Advanced RAG configuration achieves a superior faithfulness average of 0.797. These results demonstrate that two-stage retrieval mechanisms are essential for achieving the precision required for domain-specific policy question answering, though structural constraints in document segmentation remain a significant bottleneck for multi-step reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking LLMs for Pairwise Causal Discovery in Biomedical and Multi-Domain Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The safe deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes fields like biomedicine, requires them to be able to reason about cause and effect. We investigate this ability by testing 13 open-source LLMs on a fundamental task: pairwise causal discovery (PCD) from text. Our benchmark, using 12 diverse datasets, evaluates two core skills: 1) \textbf{Causal Detection} (identifying if a text contains a causal link) and 2) \textbf{Causal Extraction} (pulling out the exact cause and effect phrases). We tested various prompting methods, from simple instructions (zero-shot) to more complex strategies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Few-shot In-Context Learning (FICL).
  The results show major deficiencies in current models. The best model for detection, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, only achieved a mean score of 49.57\% ($C_{detect}$), while the best for extraction, Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct, reached just 47.12\% ($C_{extract}$). Models performed best on simple, explicit, single-sentence relations. However, performance plummeted for more difficult (and realistic) cases, such as implicit relationships, links spanning multiple sentences, and texts containing multiple causal pairs. We provide a unified evaluation framework, built on a dataset validated with high inter-annotator agreement ($\kappa \ge 0.758$), and make all our data, code, and prompts publicly available to spur further research. \href{https://github.com/sydneyanuyah/CausalDiscovery}{Code available here: https://github.com/sydneyanuyah/CausalDiscovery}</description>

      <title>Multi-Persona Thinking for Bias Mitigation in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant social biases that can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and unfair outcomes. In this paper, we propose Multi-Persona Thinking (MPT), a novel inference-time framework that leverages dialectical reasoning from multiple perspectives to reduce bias. MPT guides models to adopt contrasting social identities (e.g., male and female) along with a neutral viewpoint, and then engages these personas iteratively to expose and correct biases. Through a dialectical reasoning process, the framework transforms the potential weakness of persona assignment into a strength for bias mitigation. We evaluate MPT on two widely used bias benchmarks across both open-source and closed-source models of varying scales. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over existing prompting-based strategies: MPT achieves the lowest bias while maintaining core reasoning ability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from recent findings including surprisingly decent performance of transformers without positional encoding (NoPE) in the domain of language models and how registers (additional throwaway tokens not tied to input) may improve the performance of large vision transformers (ViTs), we invent and test a variant of ViT called fractal ViT that breaks permutation invariance among the tokens by applying an attention mask between the regular tokens and ``summary tokens'' similar to registers, in isolation or in combination with various positional encodings. These models do not improve upon ViT with registers, highlighting the fact that these findings may be scale, domain, or application-specific.</description>

      <title>Computational Representations of Character Significance in Novels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characters in novels have typically been modeled based on their presence in scenes in narrative, considering aspects like their actions, named mentions, and dialogue. This conception of character places significant emphasis on the main character who is present in the most scenes. In this work, we instead adopt a framing developed from a new literary theory proposing a six-component structural model of character. This model enables a comprehensive approach to character that accounts for the narrator-character distinction and includes a component neglected by prior methods, discussion by other characters. We compare general-purpose LLMs with task-specific transformers for operationalizing this model of character on major 19th-century British realist novels. Our methods yield both component-level and graph representations of character discussion. We then demonstrate that these representations allow us to approach literary questions at scale from a new computational lens. Specifically, we explore Woloch's classic "the one vs the many" theory of character centrality and the gendered dynamics of character discussion.</description>

      <title>AdversaRiskQA: An Adversarial Factuality Benchmark for High-Risk Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains an acute concern, contributing to the spread of misinformation and diminished public trust, particularly in high-risk domains. Among hallucination types, factuality is crucial, as it concerns a model's alignment with established world knowledge. Adversarial factuality, defined as the deliberate insertion of misinformation into prompts with varying levels of expressed confidence, tests a model's ability to detect and resist confidently framed falsehoods. Existing work lacks high-quality, domain-specific resources for assessing model robustness under such adversarial conditions, and no prior research has examined the impact of injected misinformation on long-form text factuality.
  To address this gap, we introduce AdversaRiskQA, the first verified and reliable benchmark systematically evaluating adversarial factuality across Health, Finance, and Law. The benchmark includes two difficulty levels to test LLMs' defensive capabilities across varying knowledge depths. We propose two automated methods for evaluating the adversarial attack success and long-form factuality. We evaluate six open- and closed-source LLMs from the Qwen, GPT-OSS, and GPT families, measuring misinformation detection rates. Long-form factuality is assessed on Qwen3 (30B) under both baseline and adversarial conditions. Results show that after excluding meaningless responses, Qwen3 (80B) achieves the highest average accuracy, while GPT-5 maintains consistently high accuracy. Performance scales non-linearly with model size, varies by domains, and gaps between difficulty levels narrow as models grow. Long-form evaluation reveals no significant correlation between injected misinformation and the model's factual output. AdversaRiskQA provides a valuable benchmark for pinpointing LLM weaknesses and developing more reliable models for high-stakes applications.</description>

      <title>Common to Whom? Regional Cultural Commonsense and LLM Bias in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing cultural commonsense benchmarks treat nations as monolithic, assuming uniform practices within national boundaries. But does cultural commonsense hold uniformly within a nation, or does it vary at the sub-national level? We introduce Indica, the first benchmark designed to test LLMs' ability to address this question, focusing on India - a nation of 28 states, 8 union territories, and 22 official languages. We collect human-annotated answers from five Indian regions (North, South, East, West, and Central) across 515 questions spanning 8 domains of everyday life, yielding 1,630 region-specific question-answer pairs. Strikingly, only 39.4% of questions elicit agreement across all five regions, demonstrating that cultural commonsense in India is predominantly regional, not national. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs and find two critical gaps: models achieve only 13.4%-20.9% accuracy on region-specific questions, and they exhibit geographic bias, over-selecting Central and North India as the "default" (selected 30-40% more often than expected) while under-representing East and West. Beyond India, our methodology provides a generalizable framework for evaluating cultural commonsense in any culturally heterogeneous nation, from question design grounded in anthropological taxonomy, to regional data collection, to bias measurement.</description>

      <title>From Generation to Collaboration: Using LLMs to Edit for Empathy in Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical empathy is essential for patient care, but physicians need continually balance emotional warmth with factual precision under the cognitive and emotional constraints of clinical practice. This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) can function as empathy editors, refining physicians' written responses to enhance empathetic tone while preserving underlying medical information. More importantly, we introduce novel quantitative metrics, an Empathy Ranking Score and a MedFactChecking Score to systematically assess both emotional and factual quality of the responses. Experimental results show that LLM edited responses significantly increase perceived empathy while preserving factual accuracy compared with fully LLM generated outputs. These findings suggest that using LLMs as editorial assistants, rather than autonomous generators, offers a safer, more effective pathway to empathetic and trustworthy AI-assisted healthcare communication.</description>

      <title>YuFeng-XGuard: A Reasoning-Centric, Interpretable, and Flexible Guardrail Model for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, safety guardrails are required to go beyond coarse-grained filtering and support fine-grained, interpretable, and adaptable risk assessment. However, existing solutions often rely on rapid classification schemes or post-hoc rules, resulting in limited transparency, inflexible policies, or prohibitive inference costs. To this end, we present YuFeng-XGuard, a reasoning-centric guardrail model family designed to perform multi-dimensional risk perception for LLM interactions. Instead of producing opaque binary judgments, YuFeng-XGuard generates structured risk predictions, including explicit risk categories and configurable confidence scores, accompanied by natural language explanations that expose the underlying reasoning process. This formulation enables safety decisions that are both actionable and interpretable. To balance decision latency and explanatory depth, we adopt a tiered inference paradigm that performs an initial risk decision based on the first decoded token, while preserving ondemand explanatory reasoning when required. In addition, we introduce a dynamic policy mechanism that decouples risk perception from policy enforcement, allowing safety policies to be adjusted without model retraining. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of public safety benchmarks demonstrate that YuFeng-XGuard achieves stateof-the-art performance while maintaining strong efficiency-efficacy trade-offs. We release YuFeng-XGuard as an open model family, including both a full-capacity variant and a lightweight version, to support a wide range of deployment scenarios.</description>

      <title>Parallelism and Generation Order in Masked Diffusion Language Models: Limits Today, Potential Tomorrow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) promise parallel token generation and arbitrary-order decoding, yet it remains unclear to what extent current models truly realize these capabilities. We characterize MDLM behavior along two dimensions -- parallelism strength and generation order -- using Average Finalization Parallelism (AFP) and Kendall's tau. We evaluate eight mainstream MDLMs (up to 100B parameters) on 58 benchmarks spanning knowledge, reasoning, and programming. The results show that MDLMs still lag behind comparably sized autoregressive models, mainly because parallel probabilistic modeling weakens inter-token dependencies. Meanwhile, MDLMs exhibit adaptive decoding behavior: their parallelism and generation order vary significantly with the task domain, the stage of reasoning, and whether the output is correct. On tasks that require "backward information" (e.g., Sudoku), MDLMs adopt a solution order that tends to fill easier Sudoku blanks first, highlighting their advantages. Finally, we provide theoretical motivation and design insights supporting a Generate-then-Edit paradigm, which mitigates dependency loss while retaining the efficiency of parallel decoding.</description>

      <title>ToxiTwitch: Toward Emote-Aware Hybrid Moderation for Live Streaming Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of live-streaming platforms such as Twitch has introduced complex challenges in moderating toxic behavior. Traditional moderation approaches, such as human annotation and keyword-based filtering, have demonstrated utility, but human moderators on Twitch constantly struggle to scale effectively in the fast-paced, high-volume, and context-rich chat environment of the platform while also facing harassment themselves. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Llama-3-8B-Instruct, offer new opportunities for toxicity detection, especially in understanding nuanced, multimodal communication involving emotes. In this work, we present an exploratory comparison of toxicity detection approaches tailored to Twitch. Our analysis reveals that incorporating emotes improves the detection of toxic behavior. To this end, we introduce ToxiTwitch, a hybrid model that combines LLM-generated embeddings of text and emotes with traditional machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest and SVM. In our case study, the proposed hybrid approach reaches up to 80 percent accuracy under channel-specific training (with 13 percent improvement over BERT and F1-score of 76 percent). This work is an exploratory study intended to surface challenges and limits of emote-aware toxicity detection on Twitch.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Medical LLMs: Benchmarking and Enhancing Confidence Estimation of Large Language Models in Medical Consultation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale language models (LLMs) often offer clinical judgments based on incomplete information, increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. Existing studies have primarily evaluated confidence in single-turn, static settings, overlooking the coupling between confidence and correctness as clinical evidence accumulates during real consultations, which limits their support for reliable decision-making. We propose the first benchmark for assessing confidence in multi-turn interaction during realistic medical consultations. Our benchmark unifies three types of medical data for open-ended diagnostic generation and introduces an information sufficiency gradient to characterize the confidence-correctness dynamics as evidence increases. We implement and compare 27 representative methods on this benchmark; two key insights emerge: (1) medical data amplifies the inherent limitations of token-level and consistency-level confidence methods, and (2) medical reasoning must be evaluated for both diagnostic accuracy and information completeness. Based on these insights, we present MedConf, an evidence-grounded linguistic self-assessment framework that constructs symptom profiles via retrieval-augmented generation, aligns patient information with supporting, missing, and contradictory relations, and aggregates them into an interpretable confidence estimate through weighted integration. Across two LLMs and three medical datasets, MedConf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both AUROC and Pearson correlation coefficient metrics, maintaining stable performance under conditions of information insufficiency and multimorbidity. These results demonstrate that information adequacy is a key determinant of credible medical confidence modeling, providing a new pathway toward building more reliable and interpretable large medical models.</description>

      <title>What Patients Really Ask: Exploring the Effect of False Assumptions in Patient Information Seeking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patients are increasingly using large language models (LLMs) to seek answers to their healthcare-related questions. However, benchmarking efforts in LLMs for question answering often focus on medical exam questions, which differ significantly in style and content from the questions patients actually raise in real life. To bridge this gap, we sourced data from Google's People Also Ask feature by querying the top 200 prescribed medications in the United States, curating a dataset of medical questions people commonly ask. A considerable portion of the collected questions contains incorrect assumptions and dangerous intentions. We demonstrate that the emergence of these corrupted questions is not uniformly random and depends heavily on the degree of incorrectness in the history of questions that led to their appearance. Current LLMs that perform strongly on other benchmarks struggle to identify incorrect assumptions in everyday questions.</description>

      <title>Persona Switch: Mixing Distinct Perspectives in Decoding Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Role-play prompting is known to steer the behavior of language models by injecting a persona into the prompt, improving their zero-shot reasoning capabilities. However, such improvements are inconsistent across different tasks or instances. This inconsistency suggests that zero-shot and role-play prompting may offer complementary strengths rather than one being universally superior. Building on this insight, we propose Persona Switch, a novel decoding method that dynamically combines the benefits of both prompting strategies. Our method proceeds step-by-step, selecting the better output between zero-shot and role-play prompting at each step by comparing their output confidence, as measured by the logit gap. Experiments with widely-used LLMs demonstrate that Persona Switch consistently outperforms competitive baselines, achieving up to 5.13% accuracy improvement. Furthermore, we show that output confidence serves as an informative measure for selecting the more reliable output.</description>

      <title>Dancing in Chains: Strategic Persuasion in Academic Rebuttal via Theory of Mind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although artificial intelligence (AI) has become deeply integrated into various stages of the research workflow and achieved remarkable advancements, academic rebuttal remains a significant and underexplored challenge. This is because rebuttal is a complex process of strategic communication under severe information asymmetry rather than a simple technical debate. Consequently, current approaches struggle as they largely imitate surface-level linguistics, missing the essential element of perspective-taking required for effective persuasion. In this paper, we introduce RebuttalAgent, the first framework to ground academic rebuttal in Theory of Mind (ToM), operationalized through a ToM-Strategy-Response (TSR) pipeline that models reviewer mental state, formulates persuasion strategy, and generates strategy-grounded response. To train our agent, we construct RebuttalBench, a large-scale dataset synthesized via a novel critique-and-refine approach. Our training process consists of two stages, beginning with a supervised fine-tuning phase to equip the agent with ToM-based analysis and strategic planning capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning phase leveraging the self-reward mechanism for scalable self-improvement. For reliable and efficient automated evaluation, we further develop Rebuttal-RM, a specialized evaluator trained on over 100K samples of multi-source rebuttal data, which achieves scoring consistency with human preferences surpassing powerful judge GPT-4.1. Extensive experiments show RebuttalAgent significantly outperforms the base model by an average of 18.3% on automated metrics, while also outperforming advanced proprietary models across both automated and human evaluations. Disclaimer: the generated rebuttal content is for reference only to inspire authors and assist in drafting. It is not intended to replace the author's own critical analysis and response.</description>

      <title>Hallucination Mitigating for Medical Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of medical report generation (MRG), the integration of natural language processing has emerged as a vital tool to alleviate the workload of radiologists. Despite the impressive capabilities demonstrated by large vision language models (LVLMs) in understanding natural language, their susceptibility to generating plausible yet inaccurate claims, known as ``hallucinations'', raises concerns-especially in the nuanced and critical field of medical. In this work, we introduce a framework, \textbf{K}nowledge-\textbf{E}nhanced with Fine-Grained \textbf{R}einforced Rewards \textbf{M}edical Report Generation (KERM), to tackle the issue. Our approach refines the input to the LVLM by first utilizing MedCLIP for knowledge retrieval, incorporating relevant lesion fact sentences from a curated knowledge corpus. We then introduce a novel purification module to ensure the retrieved knowledge is contextually relevant to the patient's clinical context. Subsequently, we employ fine-grained rewards to guide these models in generating highly supportive and clinically relevant descriptions, ensuring the alignment of model's outputs with desired behaviors. Experimental results on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating hallucinations and enhancing report quality.</description>

      <title>Beyond Marginal Distributions: A Framework to Evaluate the Representativeness of Demographic-Aligned LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used to represent human opinions, values, or beliefs, and their steerability towards these ideals is an active area of research. Existing work focuses predominantly on aligning marginal response distributions, treating each survey item independently. While essential, this may overlook deeper latent structures that characterise real populations and underpin cultural values theories. We propose a framework for evaluating the representativeness of aligned models through multivariate correlation patterns in addition to marginal distributions. We show the value of our evaluation scheme by comparing two model steering techniques (persona prompting and demographic fine-tuning) and evaluating them against human responses from the World Values Survey. While the demographically fine-tuned model better approximates marginal response distributions than persona prompting, both techniques fail to fully capture the gold standard correlation patterns. We conclude that representativeness is a distinct aspect of value alignment and an evaluation focused on marginals can mask structural failures, leading to overly optimistic conclusions about model capabilities.</description>

      <title>HumanLLM: Towards Personalized Understanding and Simulation of Human Nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) in objective tasks like mathematics and coding, there is growing interest in their potential to simulate human behavior--a capability with profound implications for transforming social science research and customer-centric business insights. However, LLMs often lack a nuanced understanding of human cognition and behavior, limiting their effectiveness in social simulation and personalized applications. We posit that this limitation stems from a fundamental misalignment: standard LLM pretraining on vast, uncontextualized web data does not capture the continuous, situated context of an individual's decisions, thoughts, and behaviors over time. To bridge this gap, we introduce HumanLLM, a foundation model designed for personalized understanding and simulation of individuals. We first construct the Cognitive Genome Dataset, a large-scale corpus curated from real-world user data on platforms like Reddit, Twitter, Blogger, and Amazon. Through a rigorous, multi-stage pipeline involving data filtering, synthesis, and quality control, we automatically extract over 5.5 million user logs to distill rich profiles, behaviors, and thinking patterns. We then formulate diverse learning tasks and perform supervised fine-tuning to empower the model to predict a wide range of individualized human behaviors, thoughts, and experiences. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that HumanLLM achieves superior performance in predicting user actions and inner thoughts, more accurately mimics user writing styles and preferences, and generates more authentic user profiles compared to base models. Furthermore, HumanLLM shows significant gains on out-of-domain social intelligence benchmarks, indicating enhanced generalization.</description>

      <title>SteerEval: Inference-time Interventions Strengthen Multilingual Generalization in Neural Summarization Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing body of work has leveraged multilingual language models for Natural Language Generation tasks such as summarization. A major empirical bottleneck in this area is the shortage of accurate and robust evaluation metrics for many languages, which hinders progress. Recent studies suggest that multilingual language models often use English as an internal pivot language, and that misalignment with this pivot can lead to degraded downstream performance. Motivated by the hypothesis that this mismatch could also apply to multilingual neural metrics, we ask whether steering their activations toward an English pivot can improve correlation with human judgments. We experiment with encoder- and decoder-based metrics and find that test-time intervention methods are effective across the board, increasing metric effectiveness for diverse languages.</description>

      <title>ExDR: Explanation-driven Dynamic Retrieval Enhancement for Multimodal Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal fake news poses a serious societal threat, as its evolving nature and reliance on timely factual details challenge existing detection methods. Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation provides a promising solution by triggering keyword-based retrieval and incorporating external knowledge, thus enabling both efficient and accurate evidence selection. However, it still faces challenges in addressing issues such as redundant retrieval, coarse similarity, and irrelevant evidence when applied to deceptive content. In this paper, we propose ExDR, an Explanation-driven Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Multimodal Fake News Detection. Our framework systematically leverages model-generated explanations in both the retrieval triggering and evidence retrieval modules. It assesses triggering confidence from three complementary dimensions, constructs entity-aware indices by fusing deceptive entities, and retrieves contrastive evidence based on deception-specific features to challenge the initial claim and enhance the final prediction. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, AMG and MR2, demonstrate that ExDR consistently outperforms previous methods in retrieval triggering accuracy, retrieval quality, and overall detection performance, highlighting its effectiveness and generalization capability.</description>

      <title>Can professional translators identify machine-generated text?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates whether professional translators can reliably identify short stories generated in Italian by artificial intelligence (AI) without prior specialized training. Sixty-nine translators took part in an in-person experiment, where they assessed three anonymized short stories - two written by ChatGPT-4o and one by a human author. For each story, participants rated the likelihood of AI authorship and provided justifications for their choices. While average results were inconclusive, a statistically significant subset (16.2%) successfully distinguished the synthetic texts from the human text, suggesting that their judgements were informed by analytical skill rather than chance. However, a nearly equal number misclassified the texts in the opposite direction, often relying on subjective impressions rather than objective markers, possibly reflecting a reader preference for AI-generated texts. Low burstiness and narrative contradiction emerged as the most reliable indicators of synthetic authorship, with unexpected calques, semantic loans and syntactic transfer from English also reported. In contrast, features such as grammatical accuracy and emotional tone frequently led to misclassification. These findings raise questions about the role and scope of synthetic-text editing in professional contexts.</description>

      <title>Determinants of Training Corpus Size for Clinical Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: Clinical text classification using natural language processing (NLP) models requires adequate training data to achieve optimal performance. For that, 200-500 documents are typically annotated. The number is constrained by time and costs and lacks justification of the sample size requirements and their relationship to text vocabulary properties.
  Methods: Using the publicly available MIMIC-III dataset containing hospital discharge notes with ICD-9 diagnoses as labels, we employed pre-trained BERT embeddings followed by Random Forest classifiers to identify 10 randomly selected diagnoses, varying training corpus sizes from 100 to 10,000 documents, and analyzed vocabulary properties by identifying strong and noisy predictive words through Lasso logistic regression on bag-of-words embeddings.
  Results: Learning curves varied significantly across the 10 classification tasks despite identical preprocessing and algorithms, with 600 documents sufficient to achieve 95% of the performance attainable with 10,000 documents for all tasks. Vocabulary analysis revealed that more strong predictors and fewer noisy predictors were associated with steeper learning curves, where every 100 additional noisy words decreased accuracy by approximately 0.02 while 100 additional strong predictors increased maximum accuracy by approximately 0.04.</description>

      <title>Artificial Rigidities vs. Biological Noise: A Comparative Analysis of Multisensory Integration in AV-HuBERT and Human Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates AV-HuBERT's perceptual bio-fidelity by benchmarking its response to incongruent audiovisual stimuli (McGurk effect) against human observers (N=44). Results reveal a striking quantitative isomorphism: AI and humans exhibited nearly identical auditory dominance rates (32.0% vs. 31.8%), suggesting the model captures biological thresholds for auditory resistance. However, AV-HuBERT showed a deterministic bias toward phonetic fusion (68.0%), significantly exceeding human rates (47.7%). While humans displayed perceptual stochasticity and diverse error profiles, the model remained strictly categorical. Findings suggest that current self-supervised architectures mimic multisensory outcomes but lack the neural variability inherent to human speech perception.</description>

      <title>Stable-DiffCoder: Pushing the Frontier of Code Diffusion Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (DLLMs) offer non-sequential, block-wise generation and richer data reuse compared to autoregressive (AR) models, but existing code DLLMs still lag behind strong AR baselines under comparable budgets. We revisit this setting in a controlled study and introduce Stable-DiffCoder, a block diffusion code model that reuses the Seed-Coder architecture, data, and training pipeline. To enable efficient knowledge learning and stable training, we incorporate a block diffusion continual pretraining (CPT) stage enhanced by a tailored warmup and block-wise clipped noise schedule. Under the same data and architecture, Stable-DiffCoder overall outperforms its AR counterpart on a broad suite of code benchmarks. Moreover, relying only on the CPT and supervised fine-tuning stages, Stable-DiffCoder achieves stronger performance than a wide range of \~8B ARs and DLLMs, demonstrating that diffusion-based training can improve code modeling quality beyond AR training alone. Moreover, diffusion-based any-order modeling improves structured code modeling for editing and reasoning, and through data augmentation, benefits low-resource coding languages.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning from ImageNet for MEG-Based Decoding of Imagined Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-invasive decoding of imagined speech remains challenging due to weak, distributed signals and limited labeled data. Our paper introduces an image-based approach that transforms magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals into time-frequency representations compatible with pretrained vision models. MEG data from 21 participants performing imagined speech tasks were projected into three spatial scalogram mixtures via a learnable sensor-space convolution, producing compact image-like inputs for ImageNet-pretrained vision architectures. These models outperformed classical and non-pretrained models, achieving up to 90.4% balanced accuracy for imagery vs. silence, 81.0% vs. silent reading, and 60.6% for vowel decoding. Cross-subject evaluation confirmed that pretrained models capture shared neural representations, and temporal analyses localized discriminative information to imagery-locked intervals. These findings show that pretrained vision models applied to image-based MEG representations can effectively capture the structure of imagined speech in non-invasive neural signals.</description>

      <title>Mecellem Models: Turkish Models Trained from Scratch and Continually Pre-trained for the Legal Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Mecellem models, a framework for developing specialized language models for the Turkish legal domain through domain adaptation strategies. We make two contributions: (1)Encoder Model Pre-trained from Scratch: ModernBERT-based bidirectional encoders pre-trained on a Turkish-dominant corpus of 112.7 billion tokens. We implement a checkpoint selection strategy that evaluates downstream retrieval performance throughout training, revealing that optimal checkpoints achieve best retrieval scores before pre-training loss reaches its minimum. Our encoder models achieve top-3 rankings on the Turkish retrieval leaderboard, with smaller models (155M parameters) achieving comparable performance to larger reference models (307M-567M parameters). Our approach achieves 92.36% production efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models (embeddinggemma-300m: 100.00%, BAAI/bge-m3: 99.54%, newmindai/bge-m3-stsb: 94.38%), ranking fourth overall despite requiring less computational resources. SOTA models rely on multi-stage, computationally intensive training pipelines, making our single-stage pre-training followed by efficient post-training approach a cost-effective alternative; (2)Decoder Model with Continual Pre-training (CPT): Qwen3-1.7B and Qwen3-4B models adapted to Turkish legal domain through controlled curriculum learning. Four-phase CPT with optimal sample ratios enables gradual transition from general language knowledge to specialized legal terminology and long-context reasoning. This approach achieves 36.2% perplexity reduction on Turkish legal text, demonstrating domain adaptation gains.</description>

      <title>Universal Refusal Circuits Across LLMs: Cross-Model Transfer via Trajectory Replay and Concept-Basis Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refusal behavior in aligned LLMs is often viewed as model-specific, yet we hypothesize it stems from a universal, low-dimensional semantic circuit shared across models. To test this, we introduce Trajectory Replay via Concept-Basis Reconstruction, a framework that transfers refusal interventions from donor to target models, spanning diverse architectures (e.g., Dense to MoE) and training regimes, without using target-side refusal supervision. By aligning layers via concept fingerprints and reconstructing refusal directions using a shared ``recipe'' of concept atoms, we map the donor's ablation trajectory into the target's semantic space. To preserve capabilities, we introduce a weight-SVD stability guard that projects interventions away from high-variance weight subspaces to prevent collateral damage. Our evaluation across 8 model pairs (including GPT-OSS-20B and GLM-4) confirms that these transferred recipes consistently attenuate refusal while maintaining performance, providing strong evidence for the semantic universality of safety alignment.</description>

      <title>Adapter Fusion for Multilingual Text2Cypher with Linear and Learned Gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models enable users to access database using natural language interfaces using tools like Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher, which translate user questions into structured database queries. While these systems improve database accessibility, most research focuses on English with limited multilingual support. This work investigates a scalable multilingual Text2Cypher, aiming to support new languages without re-running full fine-tuning, avoiding manual hyper-parameter tuning, and maintaining performance close to joint multilingual fine-tuning. We train language-specific LoRA adapters for English, Spanish, and Turkish and combined them via uniform linear merging or learned fusion MLP with dynamic gating. Experimental results show that the fusion MLP recovers around 75\% of the accuracy gains from joint multilingual fine-tuning while requiring only a smaller subset of the data, outperforming linear merging across all three languages. This approach enables incremental language expansion to new languages by requiring only one LoRA adapter and a lightweight MLP retraining. Learned adapter fusion offers a practical alternative to expensive joint fine-tuning, balancing performance, data efficiency, and scalability for multilingual Text2Cypher task.</description>

      <title>synthocr-gen: A synthetic ocr dataset generator for low-resource languages- breaking the data barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for low-resource languages remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of large-scale annotated training datasets. Languages such as Kashmiri, with approximately 7 million speakers and a complex Perso-Arabic script featuring unique diacritical marks, currently lack support in major OCR systems including Tesseract, TrOCR, and PaddleOCR. Manual dataset creation for such languages is prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone, often requiring word by word transcription of printed or handwritten text.
  We present SynthOCR-Gen, an open-source synthetic OCR dataset generator specifically designed for low-resource languages. Our tool addresses the fundamental bottleneck in OCR development by transforming digital Unicode text corpora into ready-to-use training datasets. The system implements a comprehensive pipeline encompassing text segmentation (character, word, n-gram, sentence, and line levels), Unicode normalization with script purity enforcement, multi-font rendering with configurable distribution, and 25+ data augmentation techniques simulating real-world document degradations including rotation, blur, noise, and scanner artifacts.
  We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating a 600,000-sample word-segmented Kashmiri OCR dataset, which we release publicly on HuggingFace. This work provides a practical pathway for bringing low-resource languages into the era of vision-language AI models, and the tool is openly available for researchers and practitioners working with underserved writing systems worldwide.</description>

      <title>Improving Training Efficiency and Reducing Maintenance Costs via Language Specific Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning a task-specific multilingual large language model (LLM) involves training the model on a multilingual dataset with examples in all the required languages. Updating one or more supported languages with additional data or adding support for a new language involves retraining the model, which can be computationally inefficient and creates a severe maintenance bottleneck. Recent research on merging multilingual multitask models has shown promise in terms of improved quality, but its computational and maintenance efficiency remains unstudied. In this work, we provide the first focused analysis of this merging strategy from an efficiency perspective, evaluating it across three independent tasks. We demonstrate significant efficiency gains while maintaining parity in terms of quality: this merging approach reduces the initial training time by up to 50\%. We also demonstrate that updating an individual language and re-merging as part of model maintenance reduces training costs by more than 60\%, compared to re-training the full multilingual model. We show this on both public and proprietary industry datasets confirming that the approach works well for industrial use cases in addition to academic settings already studied in previous work.</description>

      <title>Automatic Classification of Arabic Literature into Historical Eras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Arabic language has undergone notable transformations over time, including the emergence of new vocabulary, the obsolescence of others, and shifts in word usage. This evolution is evident in the distinction between the classical and modern Arabic eras. Although historians and linguists have partitioned Arabic literature into multiple eras, relatively little research has explored the automatic classification of Arabic texts by time period, particularly beyond the domain of poetry. This paper addresses this gap by employing neural networks and deep learning techniques to automatically classify Arabic texts into distinct eras and periods. The proposed models are evaluated using two datasets derived from two publicly available corpora, covering texts from the pre-Islamic to the modern era. The study examines class setups ranging from binary to 15-class classification and considers both predefined historical eras and custom periodizations. Results range from F1-scores of 0.83 and 0.79 on the binary-era classification task using the OpenITI and APCD datasets, respectively, to 0.20 on the 15-era classification task using OpenITI and 0.18 on the 12-era classification task using APCD.</description>

      <title>LLM-in-Sandbox Elicits General Agentic Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce LLM-in-Sandbox, enabling LLMs to explore within a code sandbox (i.e., a virtual computer), to elicit general intelligence in non-code domains. We first demonstrate that strong LLMs, without additional training, exhibit generalization capabilities to leverage the code sandbox for non-code tasks. For example, LLMs spontaneously access external resources to acquire new knowledge, leverage the file system to handle long contexts, and execute scripts to satisfy formatting requirements. We further show that these agentic capabilities can be enhanced through LLM-in-Sandbox Reinforcement Learning (LLM-in-Sandbox-RL), which uses only non-agentic data to train models for sandbox exploration. Experiments demonstrate that LLM-in-Sandbox, in both training-free and post-trained settings, achieves robust generalization spanning mathematics, physics, chemistry, biomedicine, long-context understanding, and instruction following. Finally, we analyze LLM-in-Sandbox's efficiency from computational and system perspectives, and open-source it as a Python package to facilitate real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Graphs are Implicit Reward Models: Path-Derived Signals Enable Compositional Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have achieved near-expert performance in structured reasoning domains like mathematics and programming, yet their ability to perform compositional multi-hop reasoning in specialized scientific fields remains limited. We propose a bottom-up learning paradigm in which models are grounded in axiomatic domain facts and compose them to solve complex, unseen tasks. To this end, we present a post-training pipeline, based on a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), in which knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. By deriving novel reward signals from knowledge graph paths, we provide verifiable, scalable, and grounded supervision that encourages models to compose intermediate axioms rather than optimize only final answers during RL. We validate this approach in the medical domain, training a 14B model on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) and evaluating its zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops). Our experiments show that path-derived rewards act as a "compositional bridge", enabling our model to significantly outperform much larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro, on the most difficult reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to adversarial perturbations against option-shuffling stress tests. This work suggests that grounding the reasoning process in structured knowledge is a scalable and efficient path toward intelligent reasoning.</description>

      <title>Elsewise: Authoring AI-Based Interactive Narrative with Possibility Space Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactive narrative (IN) authors craft spaces of divergent narrative possibilities for players to explore, with the player's input determining which narrative possibilities they actually experience. Generative AI can enable new forms of IN by improvisationally expanding on pre-authored content in response to open-ended player input. However, this extrapolation risks widening the gap between author-envisioned and player-experienced stories, potentially limiting the strength of plot progression and the communication of the author's narrative intent. To bridge the gap, we introduce Elsewise: an authoring tool for AI-based INs that implements a novel Bundled Storyline concept to enhance author's perception and understanding of the narrative possibility space, allowing authors to explore similarities and differences between possible playthroughs of their IN in terms of open-ended, user-configurable narrative dimensions. A user study (n=12) shows that our approach improves author anticipation of player-experienced narrative, leading to more effective control and exploration of the narrative possibility spaces.</description>

      <title>DeepSurvey-Bench: Evaluating Academic Value of Automatically Generated Scientific Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of automated scientific survey generation technology has made it increasingly important to establish a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the quality of generated surveys.Nearly all existing evaluation benchmarks rely on flawed selection criteria such as citation counts and structural coherence to select human-written surveys as the ground truth survey datasets, and then use surface-level metrics such as structural quality and reference relevance to evaluate generated surveys.However, these benchmarks have two key issues: (1) the ground truth survey datasets are unreliable because of a lack academic dimension annotations; (2) the evaluation metrics only focus on the surface quality of the survey such as logical coherence. Both issues lead to existing benchmarks cannot assess to evaluate their deep "academic value", such as the core research objectives and the critical analysis of different studies. To address the above problems, we propose DeepSurvey-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate the academic value of generated surveys. Specifically, our benchmark propose a comprehensive academic value evaluation criteria covering three dimensions: informational value, scholarly communication value, and research guidance value. Based on this criteria, we construct a reliable dataset with academic value annotations, and evaluate the deep academic value of the generated surveys. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our benchmark is highly consistent with human performance in assessing the academic value of generated surveys.</description>

      <title>Do people expect different behavior from large language models acting on their behalf? Evidence from norm elicitations in two canonical economic games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While delegating tasks to large language models (LLMs) can save people time, there is growing evidence that offloading tasks to such models produces social costs. We use behavior in two canonical economic games to study whether people have different expectations when decisions are made by LLMs acting on their behalf instead of themselves. More specifically, we study the social appropriateness of a spectrum of possible behaviors: when LLMs divide resources on our behalf (Dictator Game and Ultimatum Game) and when they monitor the fairness of splits of resources (Ultimatum Game). We use the Krupka-Weber norm elicitation task to detect shifts in social appropriateness ratings. Results of two pre-registered and incentivized experimental studies using representative samples from the UK and US (N = 2,658) show three key findings. First, people find that offers from machines - when no acceptance is necessary - are judged to be less appropriate than when they come from humans, although there is no shift in the modal response. Second - when acceptance is necessary - it is more appropriate for a person to reject offers from machines than from humans. Third, receiving a rejection of an offer from a machine is no less socially appropriate than receiving the same rejection from a human. Overall, these results suggest that people apply different norms for machines deciding on how to split resources but are not opposed to machines enforcing the norms. The findings are consistent with offers made by machines now being viewed as having both a cognitive and emotional component.</description>

      <title>Replayable Financial Agents: A Determinism-Faithfulness Assurance Harness for Tool-Using LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM agents struggle with regulatory audit replay: when asked to reproduce a flagged transaction decision with identical inputs, most deployments fail to return consistent results. This paper introduces the Determinism-Faithfulness Assurance Harness (DFAH), a framework for measuring trajectory determinism and evidence-conditioned faithfulness in tool-using agents deployed in financial services.
  Across 74 configurations (12 models, 4 providers, 8-24 runs each at T=0.0) in non-agentic baseline experiments, 7-20B parameter models achieved 100% determinism, while 120B+ models required 3.7x larger validation samples to achieve equivalent statistical reliability. Agentic tool-use introduces additional variance (see Tables 4-7). Contrary to the assumed reliability-capability trade-off, a positive Pearson correlation emerged (r = 0.45, p &lt; 0.01, n = 51 at T=0.0) between determinism and faithfulness; models producing consistent outputs also tended to be more evidence-aligned.
  Three financial benchmarks are provided (compliance triage, portfolio constraints, DataOps exceptions; 50 cases each) along with an open-source stress-test harness. In these benchmarks and under DFAH evaluation settings, Tier 1 models with schema-first architectures achieved determinism levels consistent with audit replay requirements.</description>

      <title>Language Models Entangle Language and Culture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Users should not be systemically disadvantaged by the language they use for interacting with LLMs; i.e. users across languages should get responses of similar quality irrespective of language used. In this work, we create a set of real-world open-ended questions based on our analysis of the WildChat dataset and use it to evaluate whether responses vary by language, specifically, whether answer quality depends on the language used to query the model. We also investigate how language and culture are entangled in LLMs such that choice of language changes the cultural information and context used in the response by using LLM-as-a-Judge to identify the cultural context present in responses. To further investigate this, we evaluate LLMs on a translated subset of the CulturalBench benchmark across multiple languages. Our evaluations reveal that LLMs consistently provide lower quality answers to open-ended questions in low resource languages. We find that language significantly impacts the cultural context used by the model. This difference in context impacts the quality of the downstream answer.</description>

      <title>Logic Programming on Knowledge Graph Networks And its Application in Medical Domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rash development of knowledge graph research has brought big driving force to its application in many areas, including the medicine and healthcare domain. However, we have found that the application of some major information processing techniques on knowledge graph still lags behind. This defect includes the failure to make sufficient use of advanced logic reasoning, advanced artificial intelligence techniques, special-purpose programming languages, modern probabilistic and statistic theories et al. on knowledge graphs development and application. In particular, the multiple knowledge graphs cooperation and competition techniques have not got enough attention from researchers. This paper develops a systematic theory, technique and application of the concept 'knowledge graph network' and its application in medical and healthcare domain. Our research covers its definition, development, reasoning, computing and application under different conditions such as unsharp, uncertain, multi-modal, vectorized, distributed, federated. Almost in each case we provide (real data) examples and experiment results. Finally, a conclusion of innovation is provided.</description>

      <title>Abusive music and song transformation using GenAI and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repeated exposure to violence and abusive content in music and song content can influence listeners' emotions and behaviours, potentially normalising aggression or reinforcing harmful stereotypes. In this study, we explore the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically transform abusive words (vocal delivery) and lyrical content in popular music. Rather than simply muting or replacing a single word, our approach transforms the tone, intensity, and sentiment, thus not altering just the lyrics, but how it is expressed. We present a comparative analysis of four selected English songs and their transformed counterparts, evaluating changes through both acoustic and sentiment-based lenses. Our findings indicate that Gen-AI significantly reduces vocal aggressiveness, with acoustic analysis showing improvements in Harmonic to Noise Ratio, Cepstral Peak Prominence, and Shimmer. Sentiment analysis reduced aggression by 63.3-85.6\% across artists, with major improvements in chorus sections (up to 88.6\% reduction). The transformed versions maintained musical coherence while mitigating harmful content, offering a promising alternative to traditional content moderation that avoids triggering the "forbidden fruit" effect, where the censored content becomes more appealing simply because it is restricted. This approach demonstrates the potential for GenAI to create safer listening experiences while preserving artistic expression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the attention mechanism by viewing it through the lens of Entropic Optimal Transport, revealing that standard attention corresponds to a transport problem regularized by an implicit uniform prior. We introduce Generalized Optimal transport Attention with Trainable priors (GOAT), a new attention mechanism that replaces this naive assumption with a learnable, continuous prior. This prior maintains full compatibility with optimized kernels such as FlashAttention. GOAT also provides an EOT-based explanation of attention sinks and materializes a solution for them, avoiding the representational trade-offs of standard attention. Finally, by absorbing spatial information into the core attention computation, GOAT learns an extrapolatable prior that combines the flexibility of learned positional embeddings with the length generalization of fixed encodings.</description>

      <title>VegaChat: A Robust Framework for LLM-Based Chart Generation and Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural-language-to-visualization (NL2VIS) systems based on large language models (LLMs) have substantially improved the accessibility of data visualization. However, their further adoption is hindered by two coupled challenges: (i) the absence of standardized evaluation metrics makes it difficult to assess progress in the field and compare different approaches; and (ii) natural language descriptions are inherently underspecified, so multiple visualizations may be valid for the same query. To address these issues, we introduce VegaChat, a framework for generating, validating, and assessing declarative visualizations from natural language.
  We propose two complementary metrics: Spec Score, a deterministic metric that measures specification-level similarity without invoking an LLM, and Vision Score, a library-agnostic, image-based metric that leverages a multimodal LLM to assess chart similarity and prompt compliance.
  We evaluate VegaChat on the NLV Corpus and on the annotated subset of ChartLLM. VegaChat achieves near-zero rates of invalid or empty visualizations, while Spec Score and Vision Score exhibit strong correlation with human judgments (Pearson 0.65 and 0.71, respectively), indicating that the proposed metrics support consistent, cross-library comparison.

      <title>Beyond Prompting: Efficient and Robust Contextual Biasing for Speech LLMs via Logit-Space Integration (LOGIC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of new entities -- driven by cultural shifts, evolving trends, and personalized user data -- poses a significant challenge for existing Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs). While these models excel at general conversational tasks, their static training knowledge limits their ability to recognize domain-specific terms such as contact names, playlists, or technical jargon. Existing solutions primarily rely on prompting, which suffers from poor scalability: as the entity list grows, prompting encounters context window limitations, increased inference latency, and the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon. An alternative approach, Generative Error Correction (GEC), attempts to rewrite transcripts via post-processing but frequently suffers from "over-correction", introducing hallucinations of entities that were never spoken.
  In this work, we introduce LOGIC (Logit-Space Integration for Contextual Biasing), an efficient and robust framework that operates directly in the decoding layer. Unlike prompting, LOGIC decouples context injection from input processing, ensuring constant-time complexity relative to prompt length. Extensive experiments using the Phi-4-MM model across 11 multilingual locales demonstrate that LOGIC achieves an average 9% relative reduction in Entity WER with a negligible 0.30% increase in False Alarm Rate.</description>

      <title>CURE: Curriculum-guided Multi-task Training for Reliable Anatomy Grounded Report Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical vision-language models can automate the generation of radiology reports but struggle with accurate visual grounding and factual consistency. Existing models often misalign textual findings with visual evidence, leading to unreliable or weakly grounded predictions. We present CURE, an error-aware curriculum learning framework that improves grounding and report quality without any additional data. CURE fine-tunes a multimodal instructional model on phrase grounding, grounded report generation, and anatomy-grounded report generation using public datasets. The method dynamically adjusts sampling based on model performance, emphasizing harder samples to improve spatial and textual alignment. CURE improves grounding accuracy by +0.37 IoU, boosts report quality by +0.188 CXRFEScore, and reduces hallucinations by 18.6%. CURE is a data-efficient framework that enhances both grounding accuracy and report reliability.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel way to evaluate sycophancy of LLMs in a direct and neutral way, mitigating various forms of uncontrolled bias, noise, or manipulative language, deliberately injected to prompts in prior works. A key novelty in our approach is the use of LLM-as-a-judge, evaluation of sycophancy as a zero-sum game in a bet setting. Under this framework, sycophancy serves one individual (the user) while explicitly incurring cost on another. Comparing four leading models - Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGpt 4o, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 - we find that while all models exhibit sycophantic tendencies in the common setting, in which sycophancy is self-serving to the user and incurs no cost on others, Claude and Mistral exhibit "moral remorse" and over-compensate for their sycophancy in case it explicitly harms a third party. Additionally, we observed that all models are biased toward the answer proposed last. Crucially, we find that these two phenomena are not independent; sycophancy and recency bias interact to produce `constructive interference' effect, where the tendency to agree with the user is exacerbated when the user's opinion is presented last.</description>

      <title>MiRAGE: A Multiagent Framework for Generating Multimodal Multihop Question-Answer Dataset for RAG Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) toward multimodal, high-stakes enterprise applications has outpaced the development of domain specific evaluation benchmarks. Existing datasets often rely on general-domain corpora or purely textual retrieval, failing to capture the complexity of specialized technical documents where information is inextricably multimodal and reasoning requires synthesizing disjoint evidence. We address this gap by introducing MiRAGE, a Multiagent framework for RAG systems Evaluation, that leverages a collaborative swarm of specialized agents to generate verified, domain-specific, multimodal, and multi-hop Question-Answer datasets. MiRAGE orchestrates a swarm of specialized agents: a recursive context optimization loop to aggregate scattered evidence, an adversarial verifier agent to guarantee factual grounding, and an agent to recognize the expert persona and the relevant domain to mimic expert cognitive workflows. Extensive empirical evaluation across four distinct domains (regulations, finance, quantitative biology, and journalism) demonstrates that MiRAGE generates datasets with significantly higher reasoning complexity (&gt;2.3 average hops) and factual faithfulness. Our ablation studies point that MiRAGE can be powered by LLMs if textual descriptions of the images are available. Visual grounding still remains a frontier. By automating the creation of gold standard evaluation datasets that reflect the latent thematic structure of proprietary corpora, MiRAGE provides the necessary infrastructure to rigorously benchmark the next generation information retrieval systems.</description>

      <title>Tracking the Limits of Knowledge Propagation: How LLMs Fail at Multi-Step Reasoning with Conflicting Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common solution for mitigating outdated or incorrect information in Large Language Models (LLMs) is to provide updated facts in-context or through knowledge editing. However, these methods introduce knowledge conflicts when the knowledge update fails to overwrite the model's parametric knowledge, which propagate to faulty reasoning. Current benchmarks for this problem, however, largely focus only on single knowledge updates and fact recall without evaluating how these updates affect downstream reasoning. In this work, we introduce TRACK (Testing Reasoning Amid Conflicting Knowledge), a new benchmark for studying how LLMs propagate new knowledge through multi-step reasoning when it conflicts with the model's initial parametric knowledge. Spanning three reasoning-intensive scenarios (WIKI, CODE, and MATH), TRACK introduces multiple, realistic conflicts to mirror real-world complexity. Our results on TRACK reveal that providing updated facts to models for reasoning can worsen performance compared to providing no updated facts to a model, and that this performance degradation exacerbates as more updated facts are provided. We show this failure stems from both inability to faithfully integrate updated facts, but also flawed reasoning even when knowledge is integrated. TRACK provides a rigorous new benchmark to measure and guide future progress on propagating conflicting knowledge in multi-step reasoning.</description>

      <title>The Dark Side of AI Transformers: Sentiment Polarization &amp; the Loss of Business Neutrality by NLP Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of Transfer Learning &amp; Transformers has steadily improved accuracy and has significantly contributed in solving complex computation problems. However, this transformer led accuracy improvement in Applied AI Analytics specifically in sentiment analytics comes with the dark side. It is observed during experiments that a lot of these improvements in transformer led accuracy of one class of sentiment has been at the cost of polarization of another class of sentiment and the failing of neutrality. This lack of neutrality poses an acute problem in the Applied NLP space, which relies heavily on the computational outputs of sentiment analytics for reliable industry ready tasks.</description>

      <title>DS@GT at TREC TOT 2025: Bridging Vague Recollection with Fusion Retrieval and Learned Reranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a two-stage retrieval system that combines multiple complementary retrieval methods with a learned reranker and LLM-based reranking, to address the TREC Tip-of-the-Tongue (ToT) task. In the first stage, we employ hybrid retrieval that merges LLM-based retrieval, sparse (BM25), and dense (BGE-M3) retrieval methods. We also introduce topic-aware multi-index dense retrieval that partitions the Wikipedia corpus into 24 topical domains. In the second stage, we evaluate both a trained LambdaMART reranker and LLM-based reranking. To support model training, we generate 5000 synthetic ToT queries using LLMs. Our best system achieves recall of 0.66 and NDCG@1000 of 0.41 on the test set by combining hybrid retrieval with Gemini-2.5-flash reranking, demonstrating the effectiveness of fusion retrieval.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Deriving the Transformer as a Signal-Denoising Operator via Maximum Coding Rate Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models, particularly Transformers, are often criticized as "black boxes" and lack interpretability. We propose Prism, a white-box attention-based architecture derived from the principles of Maximizing Coding Rate Reduction ($\text{MCR}^2$). By modeling the attention mechanism as a gradient ascent process on a distinct signal-noise manifold, we introduce two physical constraints: an overcomplete dictionary to expand the representational phase space, and an irrational frequency separation ($\pi$-RoPE) to enforce incoherence between signal and noise subspaces. We demonstrate that these geometric inductive biases can be viewed as a physical constraint and they are sufficient to induce unsupervised functional disentanglement alone. Using TinyStories as a controlled testbed for verifying spectral dynamics, we observe that Prism spontaneously specializes its attention heads into spectrally distinct regimes: low-frequency heads capturing long-range causal dependencies (signal) and high-frequency heads handling local syntactic constraints (noise). Our results suggest that interpretability and performance are not a trade-off, but can be unified through principled geometric construction.</description>

      <title>LLM or Human? Perceptions of Trust and Information Quality in Research Summaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate and edit scientific abstracts, yet their integration into academic writing raises questions about trust, quality, and disclosure. Despite growing adoption, little is known about how readers perceive LLM-generated summaries and how these perceptions influence evaluations of scientific work. This paper presents a mixed-methods survey experiment investigating whether readers with ML expertise can distinguish between human- and LLM-generated abstracts, how actual and perceived LLM involvement affects judgments of quality and trustworthiness, and what orientations readers adopt toward AI-assisted writing. Our findings show that participants struggle to reliably identify LLM-generated content, yet their beliefs about LLM involvement significantly shape their evaluations. Notably, abstracts edited by LLMs are rated more favorably than those written solely by humans or LLMs. We also identify three distinct reader orientations toward LLM-assisted writing, offering insights into evolving norms and informing policy around disclosure and acceptable use in scientific communication.</description>

      <title>When Sharpening Becomes Collapse: Sampling Bias and Semantic Coupling in RL with Verifiable Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a central paradigm for turning large language models (LLMs) into reliable problem solvers, especially in logic-heavy domains. Despite its empirical success, it remains unclear whether RLVR elicits novel capabilities or merely sharpens the distribution over existing knowledge. We study this by formalizing over-sharpening, a phenomenon where the policy collapses onto limited modes, suppressing valid alternatives. At a high level, we discover finite-batch updates intrinsically bias learning toward sampled modes, triggering a collapse that propagates globally via semantic coupling. To mitigate this, we propose inverse-success advantage calibration to prioritize difficult queries and distribution-level calibration to diversify sampling via a memory network. Empirical evaluations validate that our strategies can effectively improve generalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this report, we present the Qwen3-TTS series, a family of advanced multilingual, controllable, robust, and streaming text-to-speech models. Qwen3-TTS supports state-of-the-art 3-second voice cloning and description-based control, allowing both the creation of entirely novel voices and fine-grained manipulation over the output speech. Trained on over 5 million hours of speech data spanning 10 languages, Qwen3-TTS adopts a dual-track LM architecture for real-time synthesis, coupled with two speech tokenizers: 1) Qwen-TTS-Tokenizer-25Hz is a single-codebook codec emphasizing semantic content, which offers seamlessly integration with Qwen-Audio and enables streaming waveform reconstruction via a block-wise DiT. 2) Qwen-TTS-Tokenizer-12Hz achieves extreme bitrate reduction and ultra-low-latency streaming, enabling immediate first-packet emission ($97\,\mathrm{ms}$) through its 12.5 Hz, 16-layer multi-codebook design and a lightweight causal ConvNet. Extensive experiments indicate state-of-the-art performance across diverse objective and subjective benchmark (e.g., TTS multilingual test set, InstructTTSEval, and our long speech test set). To facilitate community research and development, we release both tokenizers and models under the Apache 2.0 license.</description>

      <title>Agentic Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although AI agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in long-horizon reasoning, their reliability is severely hampered by the ``Spiral of Hallucination,'' where early epistemic errors propagate irreversibly. Existing methods face a dilemma: uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods typically act as passive sensors, only diagnosing risks without addressing them, while self-reflection mechanisms suffer from continuous or aimless corrections. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified Dual-Process Agentic UQ (AUQ) framework that transforms verbalized uncertainty into active, bi-directional control signals. Our architecture comprises two complementary mechanisms: System 1 (Uncertainty-Aware Memory, UAM), which implicitly propagates verbalized confidence and semantic explanations to prevent blind decision-making; and System 2 (Uncertainty-Aware Reflection, UAR), which utilizes these explanations as rational cues to trigger targeted inference-time resolution only when necessary. This enables the agent to balance efficient execution and deep deliberation dynamically. Extensive experiments on closed-loop benchmarks and open-ended deep research tasks demonstrate that our training-free approach achieves superior performance and trajectory-level calibration. We believe this principled framework AUQ represents a significant step towards reliable agents.</description>

      <title>Even GPT-5.2 Can't Count to Five: The Case for Zero-Error Horizons in Trustworthy LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Zero-Error Horizon (ZEH) for trustworthy LLMs, which represents the maximum range that a model can solve without any errors. While ZEH itself is simple, we demonstrate that evaluating the ZEH of state-of-the-art LLMs yields abundant insights. For example, by evaluating the ZEH of GPT-5.2, we found that GPT-5.2 cannot even compute the parity of a short string like 11000, and GPT-5.2 cannot determine whether the parentheses in ((((()))))) are balanced. This is surprising given the excellent capabilities of GPT-5.2. The fact that LLMs make mistakes on such simple problems serves as an important lesson when applying LLMs to safety-critical domains. By applying ZEH to Qwen2.5 and conducting detailed analysis, we found that while ZEH correlates with accuracy, the detailed behaviors differ, and ZEH provides clues about the emergence of algorithmic capabilities. Finally, while computing ZEH incurs significant computational cost, we discuss how to mitigate this cost by achieving up to one order of magnitude speedup using tree structures and online softmax.</description>

      <title>Towards Automated Kernel Generation in the Era of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of modern AI systems is fundamentally constrained by the quality of their underlying kernels, which translate high-level algorithmic semantics into low-level hardware operations. Achieving near-optimal kernels requires expert-level understanding of hardware architectures and programming models, making kernel engineering a critical but notoriously time-consuming and non-scalable process. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have opened new possibilities for automating kernel generation and optimization. LLMs are well-suited to compress expert-level kernel knowledge that is difficult to formalize, while agentic systems further enable scalable optimization by casting kernel development as an iterative, feedback-driven loop. Rapid progress has been made in this area. However, the field remains fragmented, lacking a systematic perspective for LLM-driven kernel generation. This survey addresses this gap by providing a structured overview of existing approaches, spanning LLM-based approaches and agentic optimization workflows, and systematically compiling the datasets and benchmarks that underpin learning and evaluation in this domain. Moreover, key open challenges and future research directions are further outlined, aiming to establish a comprehensive reference for the next generation of automated kernel optimization. To keep track of this field, we maintain an open-source GitHub repository at https://github.com/flagos-ai/awesome-LLM-driven-kernel-generation.</description>

      <title>PhysProver: Advancing Automatic Theorem Proving for Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of verifiable languages and LLMs has significantly influenced both the mathematical and computer science communities because it provides a rigorous foundation for theorem proving. Recent advancements in the field provide foundation models and sophisticated agentic systems pushing the boundaries of formal mathematical reasoning to approach the natural language capability of LLMs. However, little attention has been given to the formal physics reasoning, which also heavily relies on similar problem-solving and theorem-proving frameworks. To solve this problem, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to enhance formal theorem proving in the physics domain. We compose a dedicated dataset PhysLeanData for the task. It is composed of theorems sampled from PhysLean and data generated by a conjecture-based formal data generation pipeline. In the training pipeline, we leverage DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B, a strong open-source mathematical theorem prover, and apply Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to train our model PhysProver. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, using only $\sim$5K training samples, PhysProver achieves an overall 2.4\% improvement in multiple sub-domains. Furthermore, after formal physics training, we observe 1.3\% gains on the MiniF2F-Test benchmark, which indicates non-trivial generalization beyond physics domains and enhancement for formal math capability as well. The results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, which provides a paradigm for extending formal provers outside mathematical domains. To foster further research, we will release both our dataset and model to the community.</description>

      <title>Agentic Confidence Calibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI agents are rapidly advancing from passive language models to autonomous systems executing complex, multi-step tasks. Yet their overconfidence in failure remains a fundamental barrier to deployment in high-stakes settings. Existing calibration methods, built for static single-turn outputs, cannot address the unique challenges of agentic systems, such as compounding errors along trajectories, uncertainty from external tools, and opaque failure modes. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, the problem of Agentic Confidence Calibration and propose Holistic Trajectory Calibration (HTC), a novel diagnostic framework that extracts rich process-level features ranging from macro dynamics to micro stability across an agent's entire trajectory. Powered by a simple, interpretable model, HTC consistently surpasses strong baselines in both calibration and discrimination, across eight benchmarks, multiple LLMs, and diverse agent frameworks. Beyond performance, HTC delivers three essential advances: it provides interpretability by revealing the signals behind failure, enables transferability by applying across domains without retraining, and achieves generalization through a General Agent Calibrator (GAC) that achieves the best calibration (lowest ECE) on the out-of-domain GAIA benchmark. Together, these contributions establish a new process-centric paradigm for confidence calibration, providing a framework for diagnosing and enhancing the reliability of AI agents.</description>

      <title>ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas: Charting the Failure Landscape of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) benchmarks tell us when models fail, but not why they fail. A wrong answer on a reasoning dataset may stem from formatting issues, calculation errors, or dataset noise rather than weak reasoning. Without disentangling such causes, benchmarks remain incomplete and cannot reliably guide model improvement. We introduce ErrorMap, the first method to chart the sources of LLM failure. It extracts a model's unique "failure signature", clarifies what benchmarks measure, and broadens error identification to reduce blind spots. This helps developers debug models, aligns benchmark goals with outcomes, and supports informed model selection. ErrorMap works on any model or dataset with the same logic. Applying our method to 35 datasets and 83 models we generate ErrorAtlas, a taxonomy of model errors, revealing recurring failure patterns. ErrorAtlas highlights error types that are currently underexplored in LLM research, such as omissions of required details in the output and question misinterpretation. By shifting focus from where models succeed to why they fail, ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas enable advanced evaluation - one that exposes hidden weaknesses and directs progress. Unlike success, typically measured by task-level metrics, our approach introduces a deeper evaluation layer that can be applied globally across models and tasks, offering richer insights into model behavior and limitations. We make the taxonomy and code publicly available with plans to periodically update ErrorAtlas as new benchmarks and models emerge.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Achieving Controllable Code Completion in Code LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code completion has become a central task, gaining significant attention with the rise of large language model (LLM)-based tools in software engineering. Although recent advances have greatly improved LLMs' code completion abilities, evaluation methods have not advanced equally. Most current benchmarks focus solely on functional correctness of code completions based on given context, overlooking models' ability to follow user instructions during completion-a common scenario in LLM-assisted programming. To address this limitation, we present the first instruction-guided code completion benchmark, Controllable Code Completion Benchmark (C3-Bench), comprising 2,195 carefully designed completion tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation of over 40 mainstream LLMs across C3-Bench and conventional benchmarks, we reveal substantial gaps in instruction-following capabilities between open-source and advanced proprietary models during code completion tasks. Moreover, we develop a straightforward data synthesis pipeline that leverages Qwen2.5-Coder to generate high-quality instruction-completion pairs for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The resulting model, Qwen2.5-Coder-C3, achieves state-of-the-art performance on C3-Bench. Our findings provide valuable insights for enhancing LLMs' code completion and instruction-following capabilities, establishing new directions for future research in code LLMs. To facilitate reproducibility and foster further research in code LLMs, we open-source all code, datasets, and models.</description>

      <title>Controlling Long-Horizon Behavior in Language Model Agents with Explicit State Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents often exhibit abrupt shifts in tone and persona during extended interaction, reflecting the absence of explicit temporal structure governing agent-level state. While prior work emphasizes turn-local sentiment or static emotion classification, the role of explicit affective dynamics in shaping long-horizon agent behavior remains underexplored. This work investigates whether imposing dynamical structure on an external affective state can induce temporal coherence and controlled recovery in multi-turn dialogue. We introduce an agent-level affective subsystem that maintains a continuous Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) state external to the language model and governed by first- and second-order update rules. Instantaneous affective signals are extracted using a fixed, memoryless estimator and integrated over time via exponential smoothing or momentum-based dynamics. The resulting affective state is injected back into generation without modifying model parameters. Using a fixed 25-turn dialogue protocol, we compare stateless, first-order, and second-order affective dynamics. Stateless agents fail to exhibit coherent trajectories or recovery, while state persistence enables delayed responses and reliable recovery. Second-order dynamics introduce affective inertia and hysteresis that increase with momentum, revealing a trade-off between stability and responsiveness.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Composed Image Retrieval Evaluation: A Fine-Grained Benchmark from Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a pivotal and complex task in multimodal understanding. Current CIR benchmarks typically feature limited query categories and fail to capture the diverse requirements of real-world scenarios. To bridge this evaluation gap, we leverage image editing to achieve precise control over modification types and content, enabling a pipeline for synthesizing queries across a broad spectrum of categories. Using this pipeline, we construct EDIR, a novel fine-grained CIR benchmark. EDIR encompasses 5,000 high-quality queries structured across five main categories and fifteen subcategories. Our comprehensive evaluation of 13 multimodal embedding models reveals a significant capability gap; even state-of-the-art models (e.g., RzenEmbed and GME) struggle to perform consistently across all subcategories, highlighting the rigorous nature of our benchmark. Through comparative analysis, we further uncover inherent limitations in existing benchmarks, such as modality biases and insufficient categorical coverage. Furthermore, an in-domain training experiment demonstrates the feasibility of our benchmark. This experiment clarifies the task challenges by distinguishing between categories that are solvable with targeted data and those that expose intrinsic limitations of current model architectures.</description>

      <title>LLM Prompt Evaluation for Educational Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly common in educational applications, there is a growing need for evidence-based methods to design and evaluate LLM prompts that produce personalized and pedagogically aligned out-puts. This study presents a generalizable, systematic approach for evaluating prompts, demonstrated through an analysis of LLM-generated follow-up questions in a structured dialogue activity. Six prompt templates were designed and tested. The templates incorporated established prompt engineering patterns, with each prompt emphasizing distinct pedagogical strategies. The prompt templates were compared through a tournament-style evaluation framework that can be adapted for other educational applications. The tournament employed the Glicko2 rating system with eight judges evaluating question pairs across three dimensions: format, dialogue support, and appropriateness for learners. Data was sourced from 120 authentic user interactions across three distinct educational deployments. Results showed that a single prompt related to strategic reading out-performed other templates with win probabilities ranging from 81% to 100% in pairwise comparisons. This prompt combined persona and context manager pat-terns and was designed to support metacognitive learning strategies such as self-directed learning. The methodology showcases how educational technology re- searchers can systematically evaluate and improve prompt designs, moving beyond ad-hoc prompt engineering toward evidence-based prompt development for educational applications.</description>

      <title>Paramanu: Compact and Competitive Monolingual Language Models for Low-Resource Morphologically Rich Indian Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are expensive to pretrain and often suffer from imbalances across languages and datasets, English-centric bias, tokenizer oversegmentation for morphologically rich low-resource languages, and the curse of multilinguality. We introduce PARAMANU, the first family of Indian-only autoregressive language models trained from scratch on open-source language-specific data for the five most spoken Indian languages: Bengali, Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu. All models are designed for affordability and are trained on a single GPU with a budget under $1,000, allowing under-resourced researchers to build competitive language models. To address low-resource challenges, we develop morphology-aligned, low-fertility tokenizers, propose an interpolation-based method for token position indices in RoPE based scaling to train longer sequences efficiently. We also create instruction-tuning datasets in Bangla that are translated to the other four languages. Despite their small size (108M-367M parameters), Paramanu achieves a strong performance-efficiency tradeoff and outperforms most larger multilingual models across all five languages. Our collection is available at https://huggingface.co/collections/mitodru/paramanu.</description>

      <title>Vision-Language Models Align with Human Neural Representations in Concept Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that transformer-based vision-language models (VLMs) capture the multimodality of concept processing in the human brain. However, a systematic evaluation exploring different types of VLM architectures and the role played by visual and textual context is still lacking. Here, we analyse multiple VLMs employing different strategies to integrate visual and textual modalities, along with language-only counterparts. We measure the alignment between concept representations by models and existing (fMRI) brain responses to concept words presented in two experimental conditions, where either visual (pictures) or textual (sentences) context is provided. Our results reveal that VLMs outperform the language-only counterparts in both experimental conditions. However, controlled ablation studies show that only for some VLMs, such as LXMERT and IDEFICS2, brain alignment stems from genuinely learning more human-like concepts during pretraining, while others are highly sensitive to the context provided at inference. Additionally, we find that vision-language encoders are more brain-aligned than more recent, generative VLMs. Altogether, our study shows that VLMs align with human neural representations in concept processing, while highlighting differences among architectures. We open-source code and materials to reproduce our experiments at: https://github.com/dmg-illc/vl-concept-processing.</description>

      <title>Medal Matters: Probing LLMs' Failure Cases Through Olympic Rankings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing tasks, yet their internal knowledge structures remain poorly understood. This study examines these structures through the lens of historical Olympic medal tallies, evaluating LLMs on two tasks: (1) retrieving medal counts for specific teams and (2) identifying rankings of each team. While state-of-the-art LLMs excel in recalling medal counts, they struggle with providing rankings, highlighting a key difference between their knowledge organization and human reasoning. These findings shed light on the limitations of LLMs' internal knowledge integration and suggest directions for improvement. To facilitate further research, we release our code, dataset, and model outputs.</description>

      <title>NP-Hard Lower Bound Complexity for Semantic Self-Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model Semantic Self-Verification (SSV) as the problem of determining whether a statement accurately characterizes its own semantic properties within a given interpretive framework that formalizes a challenge in AI safety and fairness: can an AI system verify that it has correctly interpreted rules intended to govern its behavior? We prove that SSV, in this specification, is NP-complete by constructing a polynomial-time reduction from 3-Satisfiability (3-SAT). Our reduction maps a 3-SAT formula to an instance of SSV involving ambiguous terms with binary interpretations and semantic constraints derived from logical clauses. This establishes that even simplified forms of semantic self-verification should face computational barriers. The NP-complete lower bound has implications for AI safety and fairness approaches that rely on semantic interpretation of instructions, including but not limited to constitutional AI, alignment via natural language, and instruction-following systems. Approaches where an AI system verify its understanding of directives may face this computational barrier. We argue that more realistic verification scenarios likely face even greater complexity.</description>

      <title>UniAttn: Reducing Inference Costs via Softmax Unification for Post-Training LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Post-training is essential for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to real-world applications. Deploying post-trained models faces significant challenges due to substantial memory overhead and noticeable inference latency. Existing work has identified significant redundancies in LLMs and proposed efficient architectures, namely intra-layer KV sharing and cross-layer KV sharing. However, these methods still result in high inference time overhead, remaining suboptimal for post-training pre-trained LLMs. In this paper, we identify that the \texttt{Softmax} operation is a primary bottleneck for LLM inference and discover that it is actually highly redundant during post-training. We propose Softmax \textbf{Uni}fication in \textbf{Att}e\textbf{n}tion (\textbf{UniAttn}), a novel post-training method that unifies Softmax activations across transformer blocks to reduce LLM inference costs. Additionally, UniAttn adopts a linear projection to compensate for the errors induced by Softmax unification. Experiments show that UniAttn matches the performance of standard post-training while significantly reducing inference costs, outperforming existing efficient architectures during post-training.</description>

      <title>The exponential distribution of the order of demonstrative, numeral, adjective and noun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The frequency of the preferred order for a noun phrase formed by demonstrative, numeral, adjective and noun has received significant attention over the last two decades. We investigate the actual distribution of the 24 possible orders. There is no consensus on whether it is well-fitted by an exponential or a power law distribution. We find that an exponential distribution is a much better model. This finding and other circumstances where an exponential-like distribution is found challenge the view that power-law distributions, e.g., Zipf's law for word frequencies, are inevitable. We also investigate which of two exponential distributions gives a better fit: an exponential model where the 24 orders have non-zero probability (a geometric distribution truncated at rank 24) or an exponential model where the number of orders that can have non-zero probability is variable (a right-truncated geometric distribution). When consistency and generalizability are prioritized, we find higher support for the exponential model where all 24 orders have non-zero probability. These findings strongly suggest that there is no hard constraint on word order variation and then unattested orders merely result from undersampling, consistently with Cysouw's view.</description>

      <title>GENERator: A Long-Context Generative Genomic Foundation Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07272v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of DNA sequencing has produced vast genomic datasets, yet interpreting and engineering genomic function remain fundamental challenges. Recent large language models have opened new avenues for genomic analysis, but existing approaches are often limited by restricted training scope, constrained generative capability, or prohibitive computational cost. We introduce GENErator, a generative genomic foundation model for long-context DNA modeling, with a context length of 98k nucleotides, pre-trained on 386 billion nucleotides of eukaryotic DNA. Without task-specific fine-tuning, GENERator exhibits strong intrinsic capabilities: unsupervised embedding analyses reveal phylogenetically coherent structure, and sequence recovery benchmarks demonstrate generative accuracy comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art models with substantially improved computational efficiency. In a zero-shot setting, GENERator achieves competitive variant effect prediction performance relative to alignment-based methods, while remaining fully alignment-free and broadly applicable across species. With task-specific fine-tuning, the model attains leading performance on established genomic benchmarks. We further demonstrate practical generative applications. GENERator can generate protein-coding DNA sequences that translate into structurally plausible proteins and, through a prompt-guided design framework, design cis-regulatory elements with targeted activity profiles, including synthetic super-enhancers validated by high-throughput UMI-STARR-seq assays. Together, these results establish GENERator as an efficient and biologically grounded framework for genomic interpretation and programmable sequence design. Code and supplementary resources are available at https://github.com/GenerTeam/GENERator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-context understanding has emerged as a critical capability for large language models (LLMs). However, evaluating this ability remains challenging. We present SCALAR, a benchmark designed to assess citation-grounded long-context reasoning in academic writing. SCALAR leverages academic papers and their citation structure to automatically generate high-quality ground-truth labels without human annotation. It features controllable difficulty levels and a dynamic updating mechanism that mitigates data contamination. The benchmark includes two tasks: a multiple-choice QA format and a cloze-style citation prediction. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art LLMs and find that the multiple-choice task effectively distinguishes model capabilities. While human experts achieve over 90% accuracy, most models struggle. The cloze-style task is even more challenging, with no model exceeding 50% accuracy. SCALAR provides a domain-grounded, continuously updating framework for tracking progress in citation-based long-context understanding.</description>

      <title>I-MCTS: Enhancing Agentic AutoML via Introspective Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14693v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in automating machine learning tasks. However, existing LLM-based agents often struggle with low-diversity and suboptimal code generation. While recent work has introduced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to address these issues, limitations persist in the quality and diversity of thoughts generated, as well as in the scalar value feedback mechanisms used for node selection. In this study, we introduce Introspective Monte Carlo Tree Search (I-MCTS), a novel approach that iteratively expands tree nodes through an introspective process that meticulously analyzes solutions and results from parent and sibling nodes. This facilitates a continuous refinement of the node in the search tree, thereby enhancing the overall decision-making process. Furthermore, we integrate a Large Language Model (LLM)-based value model to facilitate direct evaluation of each node's solution prior to conducting comprehensive computational rollouts. A hybrid rewarding mechanism is implemented to seamlessly transition the Q-value from LLM-estimated scores to actual performance scores. This allows higher-quality nodes to be traversed earlier. Applied to the various ML tasks, our approach demonstrates a 4% absolute improvement in performance compared to the strong open-source AutoML agents, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing agentic AutoML systems.

      <title>English K_Quantization of LLMs Does Not Disproportionately Diminish Multilingual Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03592v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For consumer usage of locally deployed LLMs, the GGUF format and k\_quantization are invaluable tools for maintaining the performance of the original model while reducing it to sizes deployable with consumer-grade hardware. The number of bits dedicated to each weight from the original model is reduced based on how important they are thought to be during model inference. This importance is arrived at through the application of an 'importance matrix'-a relatively small text document meant to be representative of the LLM's standard use-cases. In the vast majority of quants available online, this document is primarily written in English. It was therefore an open question whether performance on English language tasks was preserved through the sacrifice of multilingual performance and whether it can be preserved with alternate importance matrices. This article investigates these hypotheses by quantizing Llama3.3 70B on importance matrices written in three languages (English, Norwegian, and Malayalam) and evaluating them on the MixEval dataset in both English and Norwegian. All experiments related to yielded non-significant results indicating that current quantization practices do not disproportionately harm multilingual performance.</description>

      <title>Poor Alignment and Steerability of Large Language Models: Evidence from College Admission Essays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People are increasingly using technologies equipped with large language models (LLM) to write texts for formal communication, which raises two important questions at the intersection of technology and society: Who do LLMs write like (model alignment); and can LLMs be prompted to change who they write like (model steerability). We investigate these questions in the high-stakes context of undergraduate admissions at a selective university by comparing lexical and sentence variation between essays written by 30,000 applicants to two types of LLM-generated essays: one prompted with only the essay question used by the human applicants; and another with additional demographic information about each applicant. We consistently find that both types of LLM-generated essays are linguistically distinct from human-authored essays, regardless of the specific model and analytical approach. Further, prompting a specific sociodemographic identity is remarkably ineffective in aligning the model with the linguistic patterns observed in human writing from this identity group. This holds along the key dimensions of sex, race, first-generation status, and geographic location. The demographically prompted and unprompted synthetic texts were also more similar to each other than to the human text, meaning that prompting did not alleviate homogenization. These issues of model alignment and steerability in current LLMs raise concerns about the use of LLMs in high-stakes contexts.</description>

      <title>RADLADS: Rapid Attention Distillation to Linear Attention Decoders at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03005v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Rapid Attention Distillation to Linear Attention Decoders at Scale (RADLADS), a protocol for rapidly converting softmax attention transformers into linear attention decoder models, along with two new RWKV-variant architectures, and models converted from popular Qwen2.5 open source models in 7B, 32B, and 72B sizes. Our conversion process requires only 350-700M tokens, less than 0.005% of the token count used to train the original teacher models. Converting to our 72B linear attention model costs less than \$2,000 USD at today's prices, yet quality at inference remains close to the original transformer. These models achieve state-of-the-art downstream performance across a set of standard benchmarks for linear attention models of their size. We release all our models on HuggingFace under the Apache 2.0 license, with the exception of our 72B models which are also governed by the Qwen License Agreement.

      <title>Sense and Sensitivity: Examining the Influence of Semantic Recall on Long Context Code Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for understanding large codebases, but whether they understand operational semantics of long code context or rely on pattern matching shortcuts remains unclear. We distinguish between lexical recall (retrieving code verbatim) and semantic recall (understanding operational semantics). Evaluating 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that while frontier models achieve near-perfect, position-independent lexical recall, semantic recall degrades severely when code is centrally positioned in long contexts. We introduce semantic recall sensitivity to measure whether tasks require understanding of code's operational semantics vs. permit pattern matching shortcuts. Through a novel counterfactual measurement method, we show that models rely heavily on pattern matching shortcuts to solve existing code understanding benchmarks. We propose a new task SemTrace, which achieves high semantic recall sensitivity through unpredictable operations; LLMs' accuracy exhibits severe positional effects, with median accuracy drops of 92.73% versus CRUXEval's 53.36% as the relevant code snippet approaches the middle of the input code context. Our findings suggest current evaluations substantially underestimate semantic recall failures in long context code understanding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) now shapes many aspects of our world, yet its potential for positive social impact is underexplored. This paper surveys work in ``NLP for Social Good" (NLP4SG) across nine domains relevant to global development and risk agendas, summarizing principal tasks and challenges. We analyze ACL Anthology trends, finding that inclusion and AI harms attract the most research, while domains such as poverty, peacebuilding, and environmental protection remain underexplored. Guided by our review, we outline opportunities for responsible and equitable NLP and conclude with a call for cross-disciplinary partnerships and human-centered approaches to ensure that future NLP technologies advance the public good.</description>

      <title>MEDAL: A Framework for Benchmarking LLMs as Multilingual Open-Domain Dialogue Evaluators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22777v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating the quality of open-domain chatbots has become increasingly reliant on LLMs acting as automatic judges. However, existing meta-evaluation benchmarks are static, outdated, and lacking in multilingual coverage, limiting their ability to fully capture subtle weaknesses in evaluation. We introduce MEDAL, an automated multi-agent framework for curating more representative and diverse open-domain dialogue evaluation benchmarks. Our approach leverages several state-of-the-art LLMs to generate user-chatbot multilingual dialogues, conditioned on varied seed contexts. Then, a strong LLM (GPT-4.1) is used for a multidimensional analysis of the performance of the chatbots, uncovering noticeable cross-lingual performance differences. Guided by this large-scale evaluation, we curate a new meta-evaluation multilingual benchmark and human-annotate samples with nuanced quality judgments. This benchmark is then used to assess the ability of several reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs to act as evaluators of open-domain dialogues. Using MEDAL, we uncover that state-of-the-art judges fail to reliably detect nuanced issues such as lack of empathy, commonsense, or relevance.</description>

      <title>R-KV: Redundancy-aware KV Cache Compression for Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24133v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated impressive performance in self-reflection and chain-of-thought reasoning. However, they often produce excessively long outputs, leading to prohibitively large key-value (KV) caches during inference. While chain-of-thought inference significantly improves performance on complex reasoning tasks, it can also lead to reasoning failures when deployed with existing KV cache compression approaches. To address this, we propose Redundancy-aware KV Cache Compression for Reasoning models (R-KV), a novel method specifically targeting redundant tokens in reasoning models. Our method preserves nearly 100% of the full KV cache performance using only 10% of the KV cache, substantially outperforming existing KV cache baselines, which reach only 60% of the performance. Remarkably, R-KV even achieves 105% of full KV cache performance with 16% of the KV cache. This KV-cache reduction also leads to a 90% memory saving and a 6.6X throughput over standard chain-of-thought reasoning inference. Experimental results show that R-KV consistently outperforms existing KV cache compression baselines across two mathematical reasoning datasets.</description>

      <title>MMSU: A Massive Multi-task Spoken Language Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content), paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics, semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models, highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding, providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ddwang2000/MMSU. Evaluation Code is available at https://github.com/dingdongwang/MMSU_Bench.</description>

      <title>Advances in LLMs with Focus on Reasoning, Adaptability, Efficiency and Ethics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This survey paper outlines the key developments in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs), including enhancements to their reasoning skills, adaptability to various tasks, increased computational efficiency, and the ability to make ethical decisions. The techniques that have been most effective in bridging the gap between human and machine communications include the Chain-of-Thought prompting, Instruction Tuning, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. The improvements in multimodal learning and few-shot or zero-shot techniques have further empowered LLMs to handle complex jobs with minor input. A significant focus is placed on efficiency, detailing scaling strategies, optimization techniques, and the influential Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which strategically routes inputs to specialized subnetworks to boost predictive accuracy, while optimizing resource allocation. This survey also offers a broader perspective on recent advancements in LLMs, going beyond isolated aspects such as model architecture or ethical concerns. Additionally, it explores the role of LLMs in Agentic AI and their use as Autonomous Decision-Making Systems, and categorizes emerging methods that enhance LLM reasoning, efficiency, and ethical alignment. The survey also identifies underexplored areas such as interpretability, cross-modal integration, and sustainability. While significant advancements have been made in LLMs, challenges such as high computational costs, biases, and ethical risks remain. Overcoming these requires a focus on bias mitigation, transparent decision-making, and explicit ethical guidelines. Future research will generally focus on enhancing the model's ability to handle multiple inputs, thereby making it more intelligent, safe, and reliable.</description>

      <title>SciArena: An Open Evaluation Platform for Non-Verifiable Scientific Literature-Grounded Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present SciArena, an open and collaborative platform for evaluating foundation models on scientific literature-grounded tasks. Unlike traditional benchmarks for scientific literature understanding and synthesis, SciArena engages the research community directly, following the Chatbot Arena evaluation approach of community voting on model comparisons. By leveraging collective intelligence, SciArena offers a community-driven evaluation of model performance on open-ended scientific tasks that demand literature-grounded, long-form responses. The platform currently supports 47 foundation models and has collected over 20,000 votes from human researchers across diverse scientific domains. Our analysis of the data collected so far confirms its high quality. We discuss the results and insights based on the model ranking leaderboard. To further promote research in building model-based automated evaluation systems for literature tasks, we release SciArena-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark based on collected preference data. It measures the accuracy of models in judging answer quality by comparing their pairwise assessments with human votes. Our experiments highlight the benchmark's challenges and emphasize the need for more reliable automated evaluation methods.</description>

Abstract: We introduce DocPolarBERT, a layout-aware BERT model for document understanding that eliminates the need for absolute 2D positional embeddings. We extend self-attention to take into account text block positions in relative polar coordinate system rather than the Cartesian one. Despite being pre-trained on a dataset more than six times smaller than the widely used IIT-CDIP corpus, DocPolarBERT achieves state-of-the-art results. These results demonstrate that a carefully designed attention mechanism can compensate for reduced pre-training data, offering an efficient and effective alternative for document understanding.</description>

      <title>ConlangCrafter: Constructing Languages with a Multi-Hop LLM Pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constructed languages (conlangs) such as Esperanto and Quenya have played diverse roles in art, philosophy, and international communication. Meanwhile, foundation models have revolutionized creative generation in text, images, and beyond. In this work, we leverage modern LLMs as computational creativity aids for end-to-end conlang creation. We introduce ConlangCrafter, a multi-hop pipeline that decomposes language design into modular stages -- phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon generation, and translation. At each stage, our method leverages LLMs' metalinguistic reasoning capabilities, injecting randomness to encourage diversity and leveraging self-refinement feedback to encourage consistency in the emerging language description. We construct a novel, scalable evaluation framework for this task, evaluating metrics measuring consistency and typological diversity. Automatic and manual evaluations demonstrate ConlangCrafter's ability to produce coherent and varied conlangs without human linguistic expertise.</description>

      <title>Being Kind Isn't Always Being Safe: Diagnosing Affective Hallucination in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly engaged in emotionally vulnerable conversations that extend beyond information seeking to moments of personal distress. As they adopt affective tones and simulate empathy, they risk creating the illusion of genuine relational connection. We term this phenomenon Affective Hallucination, referring to emotionally immersive responses that evoke false social presence despite the model's lack of affective capacity. To address this, we introduce AHaBench, a benchmark of 500 mental-health-related prompts with expert-informed reference responses, evaluated along three dimensions: Emotional Enmeshment, Illusion of Presence, and Fostering Overdependence. We further release AHaPairs, a 5K-instance preference dataset enabling Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for alignment with emotionally responsible behavior. DPO fine-tuning substantially reduces affective hallucination without compromising reasoning performance, and the Pearson correlation coefficients between GPT-4o and human judgments is also strong (r=0.85) indicating that human evaluations confirm AHaBench as an effective diagnostic tool. This work establishes affective hallucination as a distinct safety concern and provides resources for developing LLMs that are both factually reliable and psychologically safe. AHaBench and AHaPairs are accessible via https://huggingface.co/datasets/o0oMiNGo0o/AHaBench, and code for fine-tuning and evaluation are in https://github.com/0oOMiNGOo0/AHaBench. Warning: This paper contains examples of mental health-related language that may be emotionally distressing.</description>

      <title>The Percept-V Challenge: Can Multimodal LLMs Crack Simple Perception Problems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cognitive science research treats visual perception, the ability to understand and make sense of a visual input, as one of the early developmental signs of intelligence. Its TVPS-4 framework categorizes and tests human perception into seven skills such as visual discrimination, and form constancy. Do Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) match up to humans in basic perception? Even though there are many benchmarks that evaluate MLLMs on advanced reasoning and knowledge skills, there is limited research that focuses evaluation on simple perception. In response, we introduce Percept-V, a dataset containing 6000 program-generated uncontaminated images divided into 30 domains, where each domain tests one or more TVPS-4 skills. Our focus is on perception, so we make our domains quite simple and the reasoning and knowledge required for solving them are minimal. Since modern-day MLLMs can solve much more complex tasks, our a-priori expectation is that they will solve these domains very easily. Contrary to our belief, our experiments show a weak performance of SoTA proprietary and open-source MLLMs compared to very high human performance on Percept-V. We find that as number of objects in the image increases, performance goes down rather fast. Our experiments also identify the perception skills that are considerably harder for all models.</description>

      <title>Is this chart lying to me? Automating the detection of misleading visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604 real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support model training, we also create Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 57,665 visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art MLLMs, rule-based systems, and image-axis classifiers. Our results reveal that the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the accompanying code.</description>

      <title>Collaborate, Deliberate, Evaluate: How LLM Alignment Affects Coordinated Multi-Agent Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) get integrated into diverse workflows, they are increasingly being regarded as "collaborators" with humans, and required to work in coordination with other AI systems. If such AI collaborators are to reliably coordinate their actions and behaviors with humans or other AIs, their properties and behaviors over multi-turn interactions must be known and predictable. This paper examines how different alignment methods affect LLM agents' effectiveness as partners in multi-turn, multi-party collaborations. We study this question through the lens of intervention agents that insert themselves into group dialogues not to provide answers, but to encourage the collaborative group to slow down and reflect upon their reasoning for deliberative decision-making. Common alignment techniques are typically developed under simplified single-user settings and assume the optimality of the underlying token MDP. Using the theoretical lens of the modified-action MDP, we show how they do not account for the dynamics of long-horizon multi-party interactions. We present a novel roleplay simulation methodology, where we align LLMs according to different methods and then deploy them in collaborative task dialogues to quantify how interventions affect the trajectory of group collaboration, belief alignment, and coordination. Our results show that an intervention agent that is robust to action modification significantly outperforms common alignment baselines in supporting correct task outcomes.</description>

      <title>SPOT: An Annotated French Corpus and Benchmark for Detecting Critical Interventions in Online Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce SPOT (Stopping Points in Online Threads), the first annotated corpus translating the sociological concept of stopping point into a reproducible NLP task. Stopping points are ordinary critical interventions that pause or redirect online discussions through a range of forms (irony, subtle doubt or fragmentary arguments) that frameworks like counterspeech or social correction often overlook. We operationalize this concept as a binary classification task and provide reliable annotation guidelines. The corpus contains 43,305 manually annotated French Facebook comments linked to URLs flagged as false information by social media users, enriched with contextual metadata (article, post, parent comment, page or group, and source). We benchmark fine-tuned encoder models (CamemBERT) and instruction-tuned LLMs under various prompting strategies. Results show that fine-tuned encoders outperform prompted LLMs in F1 score by more than 10 percentage points, confirming the importance of supervised learning for emerging non-English social media tasks. Incorporating contextual metadata further improves encoder models F1 scores from 0.75 to 0.78. We release the anonymized dataset, along with the annotation guidelines and code in our code repository, to foster transparency and reproducible research.</description>

      <title>Four Over Six: More Accurate NVFP4 Quantization with Adaptive Block Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models have grown larger, interest has grown in low-precision numerical formats such as NVFP4 as a way to improve speed and reduce memory usage. However, quantizing models to NVFP4 remains difficult as the lack of precision generally degrades model performance. In this work, we address this issue with Four Over Six (4/6), a modification to the block-scaled NVFP4 quantization algorithm that yields reduced quantization error. Unlike integer formats, floating point formats have non-uniform step sizes which create larger quantization error on larger values. 4/6 takes advantage of this by adaptively scaling some blocks to smaller FP4 values, making the distribution of representable values more uniform and reducing quantization error for near-maximal values. We show that 4/6 can be implemented efficiently on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, resulting in performance gains during both pre-training and inference with minimal computational overhead. In pre-training experiments with the Nemotron 3 Nano 30B-A3B model architecture, we find that 4/6 brings training loss closer to BF16 compared to models trained with current state-of-the-art NVFP4 training recipes.

      <title>Do You Feel Comfortable? Detecting Hidden Conversational Escalation in AI Chatbots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06193v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly integrated into everyday interactions, serving not only as information assistants but also as emotional companions. Even in the absence of explicit toxicity, repeated emotional reinforcement or affective drift can gradually escalate distress in a form of \textit{implicit harm} that traditional toxicity filters fail to detect. Existing guardrail mechanisms often rely on external classifiers or clinical rubrics that may lag behind the nuanced, real-time dynamics of a developing conversation. To address this gap, we propose GAUGE (Guarding Affective Utterance Generation Escalation), logit-based framework for the real-time detection of hidden conversational escalation. GAUGE measures how an LLM's output probabilistically shifts the affective state of a dialogue.</description>

      <title>Refusal Steering: Fine-grained Control over LLM Refusal Behaviour for Sensitive Topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Refusal Steering, an inference-time method to exercise fine-grained control over Large Language Models refusal behaviour on politically sensitive topics without retraining. We replace fragile pattern-based refusal detection with an LLM-as-a-judge that assigns refusal confidence scores and we propose a ridge-regularized variant to compute steering vectors that better isolate the refusal--compliance direction. On Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, our method removes the refusal behaviour of the model around politically sensitive topics while maintaining safety on JailbreakBench and near-baseline performance on general benchmarks. The approach generalizes across 4B and 80B models and can also induce targeted refusals when desired. We analize the steering vectors and show that refusal signals concentrate in deeper layers of the transformer and are distributed across many dimensions. Together, these results demonstrate that activation steering can remove political refusal behaviour while retaining safety alignment for harmful content, offering a practical path to controllable, transparent moderation at inference time.</description>

      <title>FLEx: Language Modeling with Few-shot Language Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models have become effective at a wide range of tasks, from math problem solving to open-domain question answering. However, they still make mistakes, and these mistakes are often repeated across related queries. Natural language explanations can help correct these errors, but collecting them at scale may be infeasible, particularly in domains where expert annotators are required. To address this issue, we introduce FLEx ($\textbf{F}$ew-shot $\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{Ex}$planations), a method for improving model behavior using a small number of explanatory examples. FLEx selects representative model errors using embedding-based clustering, verifies that the associated explanations correct those errors, and summarizes them into a prompt prefix that is prepended at inference-time. This summary guides the model to avoid similar errors on new inputs, without modifying model weights. We evaluate FLEx on CounterBench, GSM8K, and ReasonIF. We find that FLEx consistently outperforms chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across all three datasets and reduces up to 83\% of CoT's remaining errors.</description>

      <title>TeleMem: Building Long-Term and Multimodal Memory for Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many NLP tasks but struggle to sustain long-term interactions due to limited attention over extended dialogue histories. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue but lacks reliable mechanisms for updating or refining stored memories, leading to schema-driven hallucinations, inefficient write operations, and minimal support for multimodal reasoning.To address these challenges, we propose TeleMem, a unified long-term and multimodal memory system that maintains coherent user profiles through narrative dynamic extraction, ensuring that only dialogue-grounded information is preserved. TeleMem further introduces a structured writing pipeline that batches, retrieves, clusters, and consolidates memory entries, substantially improving storage efficiency, reducing token usage, and accelerating memory operations. Additionally, a multimodal memory module combined with ReAct-style reasoning equips the system with a closed-loop observe, think, and act process that enables accurate understanding of complex video content in long-term contexts. Experimental results show that TeleMem surpasses the state-of-the-art Mem0 baseline with 19% higher accuracy, 43% fewer tokens, and a 2.1x speedup on the ZH-4O long-term role-play gaming benchmark.</description>

      <title>Attention Projection Mixing with Exogenous Anchors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-layer reuse of early attention projections can improve optimization and data efficiency, but it creates a structural conflict: the first layer must simultaneously act as a stable, reusable anchor for all deeper layers and as an effective computational block. We show this ''first-layer tension'' is a hidden limiter of internal-anchor designs. We propose ExoFormer, which resolves the conflict by learning exogenous anchor projections outside the sequential layer stack, decoupling the anchor role from computational refinement. We introduce a unified normalized mixing framework that mixes queries, keys, values, and gate logits using learnable coefficients (exploring coefficient granularities: elementwise/headwise/scalar), and we show that normalizing anchor sources is key to stable reuse. ExoFormer variants consistently outperform their internal-anchor counterparts, and the dynamic variant yields 1.5 downstream accuracy points while matching validation loss using 1.5x fewer tokens than Gated Attention. We explain this efficacy via an Offloading Hypothesis: external anchors preserve essential token identity, allowing layers to specialize exclusively in refinement. We release code and models to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>LLMs Got Rhythm? Hybrid Phonological Filtering for Greek Poetry Rhyme Detection and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities across NLP tasks, struggle with phonologically-grounded phenomena like rhyme detection and generation. This is even more evident in lower-resource languages such as Modern Greek. In this paper, we present a hybrid system that combines LLMs with deterministic phonological algorithms to achieve accurate rhyme identification/analysis and generation. Our approach implements a comprehensive taxonomy of Greek rhyme types, including Pure, Rich, Imperfect, Mosaic, and Identical Pre-rhyme Vowel (IDV) patterns, and employs an agentic generation pipeline with phonological verification. We evaluate multiple prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, and RAG-augmented) across several LLMs including Claude 3.7 and 4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 and open-weight models like Llama 3.1 8B and 70B and Mistral Large. Results reveal a significant "Reasoning Gap": while native-like models (Claude 3.7) perform intuitively (40\% accuracy in identification), reasoning-heavy models (Claude 4.5) achieve state-of-the-art performance (54\%) only when prompted with Chain-of-Thought. Most critically, pure LLM generation fails catastrophically (under 4\% valid poems), while our hybrid verification loop restores performance to 73.1\%. We release our system and a corpus of 40,000+ rhymes, derived from the Anemoskala and Interwar Poetry corpora, to support future research.</description>

      <title>From Interpretability to Performance: Optimizing Retrieval Heads for Long-Context Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in mechanistic interpretability have identified special attention heads, known as retrieval heads, that are responsible for retrieving information from the context. However, the role of these retrieval heads in improving model performance remains unexplored. This work investigates whether retrieval heads can be leveraged to enhance the long-context capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we propose RetMask, a method that generates training signals by contrasting normal model outputs with those from an ablated variant in which the retrieval heads are masked. This mechanism-based approach achieves substantial improvements: +2.28 points on HELMET at 128K for Llama-3.1, with +70% gains on generation with citation and +32% on passage re-ranking, while preserving performance on general tasks. Experiments across three model families reveal that the effectiveness depends on retrieval head organization: models with concentrated patterns of retrieval heads respond strongly, while those with distributed patterns show limited gains. This mechanistic relationship validates the function of retrieval heads and demonstrates that mechanistic insights can be transformed into performance enhancements.</description>

      <title>Beyond Tokens: Concept-Level Training Objectives for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next-token prediction (NTP) objective has been foundational in the development of modern large language models (LLMs), driving advances in fluency and generalization. However, NTP operates at the \textit{token} level, treating deviations from a single reference continuation as errors even when alternative continuations are equally plausible or semantically equivalent (e.g., ``mom'' vs. ``mother''). As a result, token-level loss can penalize valid abstractions, paraphrases, or conceptually correct reasoning paths, biasing models toward surface form rather than underlying meaning. This mismatch between the training signal and semantic correctness motivates learning objectives that operate over higher-level representations. We propose a shift from token-level to concept-level prediction, where concepts group multiple surface forms of the same idea (e.g., ``mom,'' ``mommy,'' ``mother'' $\rightarrow$ \textit{MOTHER}). We introduce various methods for integrating conceptual supervision into LLM training and show that concept-aware models achieve lower perplexity, improved robustness under domain shift, and stronger performance than NTP-based models on diverse NLP benchmarks. This suggests \textit{concept-level supervision} as an improved training signal that better aligns LLMs with human semantic abstractions.</description>

      <title>Codebook-Injected Dialogue Segmentation for Multi-Utterance Constructs Annotation: LLM-Assisted and Gold-Label-Free Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dialogue Act (DA) annotation typically treats communicative or pedagogical intent as localized to individual utterances or turns. This leads annotators to agree on the underlying action while disagreeing on segment boundaries, reducing apparent reliability. We propose codebook-injected segmentation, which conditions boundary decisions on downstream annotation criteria, and evaluate LLM-based segmenters against standard and retrieval-augmented baselines. To assess these without gold labels, we introduce evaluation metrics for span consistency, distinctiveness, and human-AI distributional agreement. We found DA-awareness produces segments that are internally more consistent than text-only baselines. While LLMs excel at creating construct-consistent spans, coherence-based baselines remain superior at detecting global shifts in dialogue flow. Across two datasets, no single segmenter dominates. Improvements in within-segment coherence frequently trade off against boundary distinctiveness and human-AI distributional agreement. These results highlight segmentation as a consequential design choice that should be optimized for downstream objectives rather than a single performance score.</description>

      <title>Knowing When to Abstain: Medical LLMs Under Clinical Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current evaluation of large language models (LLMs) overwhelmingly prioritizes accuracy; however, in real-world and safety-critical applications, the ability to abstain when uncertain is equally vital for trustworthy deployment. We introduce MedAbstain, a unified benchmark and evaluation protocol for abstention in medical multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) -- a discrete-choice setting that generalizes to agentic action selection -- integrating conformal prediction, adversarial question perturbations, and explicit abstention options. Our systematic evaluation of both open- and closed-source LLMs reveals that even state-of-the-art, high-accuracy models often fail to abstain with uncertain. Notably, providing explicit abstention options consistently increases model uncertainty and safer abstention, far more than input perturbations, while scaling model size or advanced prompting brings little improvement. These findings highlight the central role of abstention mechanisms for trustworthy LLM deployment and offer practical guidance for improving safety in high-stakes applications.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Alignment: Ensuring Value Consistency in Large Language Models for Sensitive Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the wide application of large language models (LLMs), the problems of bias and value inconsistency in sensitive domains have gradually emerged, especially in terms of race, society and politics. In this paper, we propose an adversarial alignment framework, which enhances the value consistency of the model in sensitive domains through continued pre-training, instruction fine-tuning and adversarial training. In adversarial training, we use the Attacker to generate controversial queries, the Actor to generate responses with value consistency, and the Critic to filter and ensure response quality. Furthermore, we train a Value-Consistent Large Language Model, VC-LLM, for sensitive domains, and construct a bilingual evaluation dataset in Chinese and English. The experimental results show that VC-LLM performs better than the existing mainstream models in both Chinese and English tests, verifying the effectiveness of the method. Warning: This paper contains examples of LLMs that are offensive or harmful in nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) has emerged as a vital approach to demystify the opaque decision-making of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing reviews primarily treat MI as an observational science, summarizing analytical insights while lacking a systematic framework for actionable intervention. To bridge this gap, we present a practical survey structured around the pipeline: "Locate, Steer, and Improve." We formally categorize Localizing (diagnosis) and Steering (intervention) methods based on specific Interpretable Objects to establish a rigorous intervention protocol. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this framework enables tangible improvements in Alignment, Capability, and Efficiency, effectively operationalizing MI as an actionable methodology for model optimization. The curated paper list of this work is available at https://github.com/rattlesnakey/Awesome-Actionable-MI-Survey.</description>

      <title>Render-of-Thought: Rendering Textual Chain-of-Thought as Images for Visual Latent Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has achieved remarkable success in unlocking the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Although CoT prompting enhances reasoning, its verbosity imposes substantial computational overhead. Recent works often focus exclusively on outcome alignment and lack supervision on the intermediate reasoning process. These deficiencies obscure the analyzability of the latent reasoning chain. To address these challenges, we introduce Render-of-Thought (RoT), the first framework to reify the reasoning chain by rendering textual steps into images, making the latent rationale explicit and traceable. Specifically, we leverage the vision encoders of existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) as semantic anchors to align the vision embeddings with the textual space. This design ensures plug-and-play implementation without incurring additional pre-training overhead. Extensive experiments on mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression and substantial inference acceleration compared to explicit CoT. Furthermore, it maintains competitive performance against other methods, validating the feasibility of this paradigm. Our code is available at https://github.com/TencentBAC/RoT</description>

      <title>The GDN-CC Dataset: Automatic Corpus Clarification for AI-enhanced Democratic Citizen Consultations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLMs are ubiquitous in modern NLP, and while their applicability extends to texts produced for democratic activities such as online deliberations or large-scale citizen consultations, ethical questions have been raised for their usage as analysis tools. We continue this line of research with two main goals: (a) to develop resources that can help standardize citizen contributions in public forums at the pragmatic level, and make them easier to use in topic modeling and political analysis; (b) to study how well this standardization can reliably be performed by small, open-weights LLMs, i.e. models that can be run locally and transparently with limited resources. Accordingly, we introduce Corpus Clarification as a preprocessing framework for large-scale consultation data that transforms noisy, multi-topic contributions into structured, self-contained argumentative units ready for downstream analysis. We present GDN-CC, a manually-curated dataset of 1,231 contributions to the French Grand D\'ebat National, comprising 2,285 argumentative units annotated for argumentative structure and manually clarified. We then show that finetuned Small Language Models match or outperform LLMs on reproducing these annotations, and measure their usability for an opinion clustering task. We finally release GDN-CC-large, an automatically annotated corpus of 240k contributions, the largest annotated democratic consultation dataset to date.</description>

      <title>LogicScore: Fine-grained Logic Evaluation of Conciseness, Completeness, and Determinateness in Attributed Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current evaluation methods for Attributed Question Answering (AQA) suffer from \textit{attribution myopia}: they emphasize verification of isolated statements and their attributions but overlook the global logical integrity of long-form answers. Consequently, Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce factually grounded yet logically incoherent responses with elusive deductive gaps. To mitigate this limitation, we present \textsc{LogicScore}, a unified evaluation framework that shifts the paradigm from local assessment to global reasoning scrutiny. Grounded in Horn Rules, our approach integrates a backward verification mechanism to systematically evaluate three key reasoning dimensions: \textit{Completeness} (logically sound deduction), \textit{Conciseness} (non-redundancy), and \textit{Determinateness} (consistent answer entailment). Extensive experiments across three multi-hop QA datasets (HotpotQA, MusiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA) and over 20 LLMs (including GPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, LLaMA3, and task-specific tuned models) reveal a critical capability gap: leading models often achieve high attribution scores (e.g., 92.85\% precision for Gemini-3 Pro) but struggle with global reasoning quality (e.g., 35.11\% Conciseness for Gemini-3 Pro). Our work establishes a robust standard for logical evaluation, highlighting the need to prioritize reasoning coherence alongside factual grounding in LLM development.

      <title>Everybody Prune Now: Structured Pruning of LLMs with only Forward Passes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05406v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structured pruning is a promising approach to create smaller, faster large language models. However, existing methods typically rely on computing the gradient via backward passes, which can inflate memory requirements and compute costs. In this work we introduce Bonsai, a gradient-free structured pruning method that eliminates the need for backpropagation, significantly reducing memory requirements and compute costs while achieving state-of-the-art pruning performance. Bonsai uses forward-pass-only perturbative pruning to enable efficient compression of large models on a broader range of hardware configurations. Unlike existing structured pruning approaches, Bonsai not only achieves better compression with fewer resources but also produces models that are twice as fast as those generated by semi-structured pruning. As a concrete demonstration, we use Bonsai to prune 7B and 8B models to 50% sparsity on a single A6000 GPU -- a task challenging for backprop-based methods in memory-constrained settings, as they require 2-3x the memory. Our results show that removing backprop as a requirement not only enables pruning larger models on constrained hardware but can also lead to state-of-the-art efficiency and performance.</description>

      <title>MedSimAI: Simulation and Formative Feedback Generation to Enhance Deliberate Practice in Medical Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical education faces challenges in providing scalable, consistent clinical skills training. Simulation with standardized patients (SPs) develops communication and diagnostic skills but remains resource-intensive and variable in feedback quality. Existing AI-based tools show promise yet often lack comprehensive assessment frameworks, evidence of clinical impact, and integration of self-regulated learning (SRL) principles. Through a multi-phase co-design process with medical education experts, we developed MedSimAI, an AI-powered simulation platform that enables deliberate practice through interactive patient encounters with immediate, structured feedback. Leveraging large language models, MedSimAI generates realistic clinical interactions and provides automated assessments aligned with validated evaluation frameworks. In a multi-institutional deployment (410 students; 1,024 encounters across three medical schools), 59.5 percent engaged in repeated practice. At one site, mean Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) history-taking scores rose from 82.8 to 88.8 (p &lt; 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.75), while a second site's pilot showed no significant change. Automated scoring achieved 87 percent accuracy in identifying proficiency thresholds on the Master Interview Rating Scale (MIRS). Mixed-effects analyses revealed institution and case effects. Thematic analysis of 840 learner reflections highlighted challenges in missed items, organization, review of systems, and empathy. These findings position MedSimAI as a scalable formative platform for history-taking and communication, motivating staged curriculum integration and realism enhancements for advanced learners.</description>

      <title>GRITHopper: Decomposition-Free Multi-Hop Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decomposition-based multi-hop retrieval methods rely on many autoregressive steps to break down complex queries, which breaks end-to-end differentiability and is computationally expensive. Decomposition-free methods tackle this, but current decomposition-free approaches struggle with longer multi-hop problems and generalization to out-of-distribution data. To address these challenges, we introduce GRITHopper-7B, a novel multi-hop dense retrieval model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. GRITHopper combines generative and representational instruction tuning by integrating causal language modeling with dense retrieval training. Through controlled studies, we find that incorporating additional context after the retrieval process, referred to as post-retrieval language modeling, enhances dense retrieval performance. By including elements such as final answers during training, the model learns to better contextualize and retrieve relevant information. GRITHopper-7B offers a robust, scalable, and generalizable solution for multi-hop dense retrieval, and we release it to the community for future research and applications requiring multi-hop reasoning and retrieval capabilities.</description>

      <title>Chat-TS: Enhancing Multi-Modal Reasoning Over Time-Series and Natural Language Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models are being rapidly deployed across many fields such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and energy, where time-series data are fundamental components. The current works are still limited in their ability to perform reasoning that involves both time-series and the corresponding textual content. We address this gap by introducing Chat-TS, a large language model (LLM) based framework designed to support reasoning over time series and textual data. Unlike traditional models, Chat-TS integrates time-series tokens into LLMs' vocabulary, enhancing its reasoning ability over both modalities without compromising core natural language capabilities. To support learning and evaluation, we contribute new datasets: the TS Instruct Training Dataset (pairing diverse time-series data with relevant text instructions and responses for instruction tuning), the TS Instruct Question and Answer (QA) Gold Dataset (multiple-choice questions to evaluate multimodal reasoning), and a TS Instruct Quantitative Probing Set (a small subset of TS Instruct QA reasoning tasks alongside math and decision-making questions for LLM evaluation). We design a training strategy to preserve the inherent reasoning capabilities of LLMs while augmenting them for time-series reasoning. Experiments show that Chat-TS achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal reasoning tasks by maintaining strong natural language proficiency while improving time-series reasoning.</description>

      <title>How malicious AI swarms can threaten democracy: The fusion of agentic AI and LLMs marks a new frontier in information warfare</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06299v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in AI offer the prospect of manipulating beliefs and behaviors on a population-wide level. Large language models and autonomous agents now let influence campaigns reach unprecedented scale and precision. Generative tools can expand propaganda output without sacrificing credibility and inexpensively create falsehoods that are rated as more human-like than those written by humans. Techniques meant to refine AI reasoning, such as chain-of-thought prompting, can just as effectively be used to generate more convincing falsehoods. Enabled by these capabilities, a disruptive threat is emerging: swarms of collaborative, malicious AI agents. Fusing LLM reasoning with multi-agent architectures, these systems are capable of coordinating autonomously, infiltrating communities, and fabricating consensus efficiently. By adaptively mimicking human social dynamics, they threaten democracy. Because the resulting harms stem from design, commercial incentives, and governance, we prioritize interventions at multiple leverage points, focusing on pragmatic mechanisms over voluntary compliance.</description>

      <title>Can Language Models Discover Scaling Laws?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21184v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering scaling laws for predicting model performance at scale is a fundamental and open-ended challenge, mostly reliant on slow, case specific human experimentation. To investigate the potential for LLMs to automate this process, we collect over 5,000 experiments from existing literature and curate eight diverse scaling law discovery tasks. While existing agents struggle to produce accurate law formulas, this paper introduces SLDAgent, an evolution-based agent that co-optimize the scaling law model and the parameters, enabling it to autonomously explore complex relationships between variables. For the first time, we demonstrates that SLDAgent can automatically discover laws that exhibit consistently more accurate extrapolation than their established, human-derived counterparts across all tasks. Through comprehensive analysis, we elucidate why these discovered laws are superior and verify their practical utility in both pretraining and finetuning applications. This work establishes a new paradigm for agentic scientific discovery, showing that AI systems can understand their own scaling behavior, and can contribute novel and practical knowledge back to the research community.</description>

      <title>Membership Inference Attacks on LLM-based Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18665v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based recommender systems (RecSys) can adapt to different domains flexibly. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, encompassing implicit feedback such as clicked items and explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed by novel privacy attacks. However, no study has been conducted on this important issue. We design several membership inference attacks (MIAs) aimed to revealing whether system prompts include victims' historical interactions. The attacks are \emph{Similarity, Memorization, Inquiry, and Poisoning attacks}, each utilizing unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on five of the latest open-source LLMs and three well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat to LLM RecSys is realistic: inquiry and poisoning attacks show significantly high attack advantages. We also discussed possible methods to mitigate such MIA threats. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts, the position of the victim in the shots, the number of poisoning items in the prompt,etc.</description>

      <title>Competitive Audio-Language Models with Data-Efficient Single-Stage Training on Public Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07526v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed NLP, yet their integration with audio remains underexplored despite audio's centrality to human communication. We introduce Falcon3-Audio, a family of Audio-Language Models (ALMs) built on instruction-tuned LLMs and Whisper encoders. Using a remarkably small amount of public audio data, less than 30K hours (5K unique), Falcon3-Audio-7B matches the best reported performance among open-weight models on the MMAU benchmark, with a score of 64.14, matching R1-AQA, while distinguishing itself through superior data and parameter efficiency, single-stage training, and transparency. Notably, our smallest 1B model remains competitive with larger open models ranging from 2B to 13B parameters. Through extensive ablations, we find that common complexities such as curriculum learning, multiple audio encoders, and intricate cross-attention connectors are not required for strong performance, even compared to models trained on over 500K hours of data.</description>

      <title>AtomWorld: A Benchmark for Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models on Crystalline Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at textual reasoning and are beginning to develop spatial understanding, prompting the question of whether these abilities can be combined for complex, domain-specific tasks. This question is essential in fields like materials science, where deep understanding of 3D atomic structures is fundamental. While initial studies have successfully applied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate understandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core reasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent. To address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on tasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure representation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF perception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current models, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in structural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these models make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the basic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in subsequent analysis and materials insights. By defining these standardized tasks, AtomWorld lays the ground for advancing LLMs toward robust atomic-scale modeling, crucial for accelerating materials research and automating scientific workflows.</description>

      <title>Can LLM Infer Risk Information From MCP Server System Logs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in solving complex tasks when integrated with external tools. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become a standard interface for enabling such tool-based interactions. However, these interactions introduce substantial security concerns, particularly when the MCP server is compromised or untrustworthy. While prior benchmarks primarily focus on prompt injection attacks or analyze the vulnerabilities of LLM-MCP interaction trajectories, limited attention has been given to the underlying system logs associated with malicious MCP servers. To address this gap, we present the first synthetic benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to identify security risks from system logs. We define nine categories of MCP server risks and generate 1,800 synthetic system logs using ten state-of-the-art LLMs. These logs are embedded in the return values of 243 curated MCP servers, yielding a dataset of 2,421 chat histories for training and 471 queries for evaluation. Our pilot experiments reveal that smaller models often fail to detect risky system logs, leading to high false negatives. While models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) tend to over-flag benign logs, resulting in elevated false positives, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) offers a better precision-recall balance. In particular, after training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Llama3.1-8B-Instruct achieves 83 percent accuracy, surpassing the best-performing large remote model by 9 percentage points. Fine-grained, per-category analysis further underscores the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in enhancing LLM safety within the MCP framework.

      <title>EfficientXpert: Efficient Domain Adaptation for Large Language Models via Propagation-Aware Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted into domain-specific variants for applications in law, healthcare, and finance. Their scale, however, limits deployment in resource-constrained settings, and existing compression approaches often either degrade after domain adaptation or require substantial additional computation. We introduce EfficientXpert, a lightweight framework for domain pruning that integrates ForeSight Mask, a propagation-aware criterion for selecting weights to prune without backpropagation, and Partial Brain Surgeon, an efficient closed-form update for low-rank adapters under a fixed sparsity pattern. With fine-tuning cost comparable to standard LoRA, EfficientXpert converts a general pretrained model into a sparse, domain-adapted expert in a single pruning step. Across health and legal benchmarks, EfficientXpert reaches up to 98 percent of dense performance at 40 percent sparsity, improving over prior pruning baselines while matching LoRA training time and staying within 1 percent of LoRA peak GPU memory in our experiments.</description>

      <title>Monadic Context Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22431v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a shift towards autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use. However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.</description>

      <title>Generalization to Political Beliefs from Fine-Tuning on Sports Team Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuned LLMs often exhibit unexpected behavior as a result of generalizing beyond the data they're shown. We present results in which an LLM fine-tuned to prefer either coastal sports teams or Southern sports teams adopt political beliefs that diverge significantly from those of the base model. While we hypothesized that the coastal model would become more liberal and the southern model would become more conservative, we find that their responses are usually similar to each other, without a clear-cut liberal or conservative bias. In addition to asking the models for numerical ratings of agreement with relevant political statements, we ask them to elaborate on their more radical answers, finding varying degrees of willingness to justify themselves. Further work is needed to understand the mechanisms by which fine-tuning on simple, narrow datasets leads to seemingly unrelated changes in model behavior.</description>

      <title>Spectral Generative Flow Models: A Physics-Inspired Replacement for Vectorized Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Spectral Generative Flow Models (SGFMs), a physics-inspired alternative to transformer-based large language models. Instead of representing text or video as sequences of discrete tokens processed by attention, SGFMs treat generation as the evolution of a continuous field governed by constrained stochastic dynamics in a multiscale wavelet basis. This formulation replaces global attention with local operators, spectral projections, and Navier--Stokes-like transport, yielding a generative mechanism grounded in continuity, geometry, and physical structure.
  Our framework provides three key innovations: (i) a field-theoretic ontology in which text and video are unified as trajectories of a stochastic partial differential equation; (ii) a wavelet-domain representation that induces sparsity, scale separation, and computational efficiency; and (iii) a constrained stochastic flow that enforces stability, coherence, and uncertainty propagation. Together, these components define a generative architecture that departs fundamentally from autoregressive modeling and diffusion-based approaches. SGFMs offer a principled path toward long-range coherence, multimodal generality, and physically structured inductive bias in next-generation generative models.</description>

      <title>Who Benefits From Sinus Surgery? Comparing Generative AI and Supervised Machine Learning for Predicting Surgical Outcomes in Chronic Rhinosinusitis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has reshaped medical imaging, yet the use of AI on clinical data for prospective decision support remains limited. We study pre-operative prediction of clinically meaningful improvement in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), defining success as a more than 8.9-point reduction in SNOT-22 at 6 months (MCID). In a prospectively collected cohort where all patients underwent surgery, we ask whether models using only pre-operative clinical data could have identified those who would have poor outcomes, i.e. those who should have avoided surgery. We benchmark supervised ML (logistic regression, tree ensembles, and an in-house MLP) against generative AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity), giving each the same structured inputs and constraining outputs to binary recommendations with confidence. Our best ML model (MLP) achieves 85 % accuracy with superior calibration and decision-curve net benefit. GenAI models underperform on discrimination and calibration across zero-shot setting. Notably, GenAI justifications align with clinician heuristics and the MLP's feature importance, repeatedly highlighting baseline SNOT-22, CT/endoscopy severity, polyp phenotype, and physchology/pain comorbidities. We provide a reproducible tabular-to-GenAI evaluation protocol and subgroup analyses. Findings support an ML-first, GenAI- augmented workflow: deploy calibrated ML for primary triage of surgical candidacy, with GenAI as an explainer to enhance transparency and shared decision-making.</description>

      <title>GutenOCR: A Grounded Vision-Language Front-End for Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GutenOCR is a family of grounded OCR front-ends obtained by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B. The resulting single-checkpoint vision-language models expose reading, detection, and grounding through a unified, prompt-based interface. Trained on business documents, scientific articles, and synthetic grounding data, the models support full-page and localized reading with line- and paragraph-level bounding boxes and conditional ``where is x?'' queries. We introduce a grounded OCR evaluation protocol and show that GutenOCR-7B more than doubles the composite grounded OCR score of its Qwen2.5-VL-7B backbone on 10.5K held-out business and scientific pages (0.40 to 0.82). On Fox and OmniDocBench v1.5, our approach substantially improves region- and line-level OCR as well as text-detection recall, but reveals trade-offs in page-level linearization, color-guided OCR, and formula-heavy layouts.</description>

      <title>Gaming the Judge: Unfaithful Chain-of-Thought Can Undermine Agent Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges to evaluate agent performance, particularly in non-verifiable settings where judgments rely on agent trajectories including chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This paradigm implicitly assumes that the agent's CoT faithfully reflects both its internal reasoning and the underlying environment state. We show this assumption is brittle: LLM judges are highly susceptible to manipulation of agent reasoning traces. By systematically rewriting agent CoTs while holding actions and observations fixed, we demonstrate that manipulated reasoning alone can inflate false positive rates of state-of-the-art VLM judges by up to 90% across 800 trajectories spanning diverse web tasks. We study manipulation strategies spanning style-based approaches that alter only the presentation of reasoning and content-based approaches that fabricate signals of task progress, and find that content-based manipulations are consistently more effective. We evaluate prompting-based techniques and scaling judge-time compute, which reduce but do not fully eliminate susceptibility to manipulation. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in LLM-based evaluation and highlight the need for judging mechanisms that verify reasoning claims against observable evidence.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Shift During Post-training from Autoregressive to Masked Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-training pretrained Autoregressive models (ARMs) into Masked Diffusion models (MDMs) has emerged as a cost-effective strategy to overcome the limitations of sequential generation. However, the internal algorithmic transformations induced by this paradigm shift remain unexplored, leaving it unclear whether post-trained MDMs acquire genuine bidirectional reasoning capabilities or merely repackage autoregressive heuristics. In this work, we address this question by conducting a comparative circuit analysis of ARMs and their MDM counterparts. Our analysis reveals a systematic "mechanism shift" dependent on the structural nature of the task. Structurally, we observe a distinct divergence: while MDMs largely retain autoregressive circuitry for tasks dominated by local causal dependencies, they abandon initialized pathways for global planning tasks, exhibiting distinct rewiring characterized by increased early-layer processing. Semantically, we identify a transition from sharp, localized specialization in ARMs to distributed integration in MDMs. Through these findings, we conclude that diffusion post-training does not merely adapt model parameters but fundamentally reorganizes internal computation to support non-sequential global planning.</description>

      <title>WavLink: Compact Audio-Text Embeddings with a Global Whisper Token</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whisper has become the de-facto encoder for extracting general-purpose audio features in large audio-language models, where a 30-second clip is typically represented by 1500 frame features projected into an LLM. In contrast, audio-text embedding models like CLAP-based models have largely relied on alternative audio encoders (e.g., HTS-AT, PaSST), and have not leveraged Whisper effectively. We present WavLink, a compact audio-text embedding model that augments Whisper encoder with a learnable global token, trained jointly with a text encoder. Through a systematic study of design choices, including pretrained text encoders, loss functions, training modes, and data mixtures, we identify configurations that yield state-of-the-art retrieval performance. Our two-stage training recipe across three model sizes, combined with Matryoshka-style supervision, improves scalability, enabling 8x smaller embeddings with minimal performance drop. WavLink also demonstrates competitive performance on AIR-Bench with MCQs and zero-shot classification.</description>

      <title>BayesianVLA: Bayesian Decomposition of Vision Language Action Models via Latent Action Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise in robot manipulation but often struggle to generalize to new instructions or complex multi-task scenarios. We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose BayesianVLA, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $\pi(a \mid v, \ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, BayesianVLA significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action.</description>
