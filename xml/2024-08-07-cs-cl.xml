      <title>MoDE: Effective Multi-task Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning with a Mixture of Dyadic Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have revolutionized the adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to diverse tasks. Recent efforts have explored mixtures of LoRA modules for multi-task settings. However, our analysis reveals redundancy in the down-projection matrices of these architectures. This observation motivates our proposed method, Mixture of Dyadic Experts (MoDE), which introduces a novel design for efficient multi-task adaptation. This is done by sharing the down-projection matrix across tasks and employing atomic rank-one adapters, coupled with routers that allow more sophisticated task-level specialization. Our design allows for more fine-grained mixing, thereby increasing the model's ability to jointly handle multiple tasks. We evaluate MoDE on the Supernatural Instructions (SNI) benchmark consisting of a diverse set of 700+ tasks and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, without introducing additional parameters. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of parameter efficiency in multi-task LLM adaptation and provide a practical solution for deploying high-performing, lightweight models.</description>

      <title>Analyzing LLMs' Capabilities to Establish Implicit User Sentiment of Software Desirability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the use of several LLMs for providing quantitative zero-shot sentiment analysis of implicit software desirability expressed by users. The study provides scaled numerical sentiment analysis unlike other methods that simply classify sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative. Numerical analysis provides deeper insights into the magnitude of sentiment, to drive better decisions regarding product desirability.
  Data is collected through the use of the Microsoft Product Desirability Toolkit (PDT), a well-known qualitative user experience analysis tool. For initial exploration, the PDT metric was given to users of ZORQ, a gamification system used in undergraduate computer science education. The PDT data collected was fed through several LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3 and 3.5, GPT4, and GPT4o) and through a leading transfer learning technique, Twitter-Roberta-Base-Sentiment (TRBS), and through Vader, a leading sentiment analysis tool, for quantitative sentiment analysis. Each system was asked to evaluate the data in two ways, first by looking at the sentiment expressed in the PDT word/explanation pairs; and by looking at the sentiment expressed by the users in their grouped selection of five words and explanations, as a whole. Each LLM was also asked to provide its confidence (low, medium, high) in its sentiment score, along with an explanation of why it selected the sentiment value.
  All LLMs tested were able to statistically detect user sentiment from the users' grouped data, whereas TRBS and Vader were not. The confidence and explanation of confidence provided by the LLMs assisted in understanding the user sentiment. This study adds to a deeper understanding of evaluating user experiences, toward the goal of creating a universal tool that quantifies implicit sentiment expressed.</description>

      <title>Dialog Flow Induction for Constrainable LLM-Based Chatbots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-driven dialog systems are used in a diverse set of applications, ranging from healthcare to customer service. However, given their generalization capability, it is difficult to ensure that these chatbots stay within the boundaries of the specialized domains, potentially resulting in inaccurate information and irrelevant responses. This paper introduces an unsupervised approach for automatically inducing domain-specific dialog flows that can be used to constrain LLM-based chatbots. We introduce two variants of dialog flow based on the availability of in-domain conversation instances. Through human and automatic evaluation over various dialog domains, we demonstrate that our high-quality data-guided dialog flows achieve better domain coverage, thereby overcoming the need for extensive manual crafting of such flows.</description>

      <title>Transforming Slot Schema Induction with Generative Dialogue State Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of defining a slot schema to represent the state of a task-oriented dialogue system is addressed by Slot Schema Induction (SSI), which aims to automatically induce slots from unlabeled dialogue data. Whereas previous approaches induce slots by clustering value spans extracted directly from the dialogue text, we demonstrate the power of discovering slots using a generative approach. By training a model to generate slot names and values that summarize key dialogue information with no prior task knowledge, our SSI method discovers high-quality candidate information for representing dialogue state. These discovered slot-value candidates can be easily clustered into unified slot schemas that align well with human-authored schemas. Experimental comparisons on the MultiWOZ and SGD datasets demonstrate that Generative Dialogue State Inference (GenDSI) outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on multiple aspects of the SSI task.</description>

      <title>MMPKUBase: A Comprehensive and High-quality Chinese Multi-modal Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal knowledge graphs have emerged as a powerful approach for information representation, combining data from different modalities such as text, images, and videos. While several such graphs have been constructed and have played important roles in applications like visual question answering and recommendation systems, challenges persist in their development. These include the scarcity of high-quality Chinese knowledge graphs and limited domain coverage in existing multi-modal knowledge graphs. This paper introduces MMPKUBase, a robust and extensive Chinese multi-modal knowledge graph that covers diverse domains, including birds, mammals, ferns, and more, comprising over 50,000 entities and over 1 million filtered images. To ensure data quality, we employ Prototypical Contrastive Learning and the Isolation Forest algorithm to refine the image data. Additionally, we have developed a user-friendly platform to facilitate image attribute exploration.</description>

      <title>Multi-Frame Vision-Language Model for Long-form Reasoning in Driver Behavior Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying risky driving behavior in real-world situations is essential for the safety of both drivers and pedestrians. However, integrating natural language models in this field remains relatively untapped. To address this, we created a novel multi-modal instruction tuning dataset and driver coaching inference system. Our primary use case is dashcam-based coaching for commercial drivers. The North American Dashcam Market is expected to register a CAGR of 15.4 percent from 2022 to 2027. Our dataset enables language models to learn visual instructions across various risky driving scenarios, emphasizing detailed reasoning crucial for effective driver coaching and managerial comprehension. Our model is trained on road-facing and driver-facing RGB camera footage, capturing the comprehensive scope of driving behavior in vehicles equipped with dashcams.</description>

      <title>Summarization of Investment Reports Using Pre-trained Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we attempt to summarize monthly reports as investment reports. Fund managers have a wide range of tasks, one of which is the preparation of investment reports. In addition to preparing monthly reports on fund management, fund managers prepare management reports that summarize these monthly reports every six months or once a year. The preparation of fund reports is a labor-intensive and time-consuming task. Therefore, in this paper, we tackle investment summarization from monthly reports using transformer-based models. There are two main types of summarization methods: extractive summarization and abstractive summarization, and this study constructs both methods and examines which is more useful in summarizing investment reports.</description>

      <title>Indexing and Visualization of Climate Change Narratives Using BERT and Causal Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a methodology to extract, index, and visualize ``climate change narratives'' (stories about the connection between causal and consequential events related to climate change). We use two natural language processing methods, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and causal extraction, to textually analyze newspaper articles on climate change to extract ``climate change narratives.'' The novelty of the methodology could extract and quantify the causal relationships assumed by the newspaper's writers. Looking at the extracted climate change narratives over time, we find that since 2018, an increasing number of narratives suggest the impact of the development of climate change policy discussion and the implementation of climate change-related policies on corporate behaviors, macroeconomics, and price dynamics. We also observed the recent emergence of narratives focusing on the linkages between climate change-related policies and monetary policy. Furthermore, there is a growing awareness of the negative impacts of natural disasters (e.g., abnormal weather and severe floods) related to climate change on economic activities, and this issue might be perceived as a new challenge for companies and governments. The methodology of this study is expected to be applied to a wide range of fields, as it can analyze causal relationships among various economic topics, including analysis of inflation expectation or monetary policy communication strategy.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Rare Causal Knowledge from Financial Statement Summaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What would happen if temperatures were subdued and result in a cool summer? One can easily imagine that air conditioner, ice cream or beer sales would be suppressed as a result of this. Less obvious is that agricultural shipments might be delayed, or that sound proofing material sales might decrease. The ability to extract such causal knowledge is important, but it is also important to distinguish between cause-effect pairs that are known and those that are likely to be unknown, or rare. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method for extracting rare causal knowledge from Japanese financial statement summaries produced by companies. Our method consists of three steps. First, it extracts sentences that include causal knowledge from the summaries using a machine learning method based on an extended language ontology. Second, it obtains causal knowledge from the extracted sentences using syntactic patterns. Finally, it extracts the rarest causal knowledge from the knowledge it has obtained.</description>

      <title>MathLearner: A Large Language Model Agent Framework for Learning to Solve Mathematical Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), large language models (LLM) are widely used in many fields. However, the reasoning ability of LLM is still very limited when it comes to mathematical reasoning. Mathematics plays an important role in all aspects of human society and is a technical guarantee in the fields of healthcare, transport and aerospace, for this reason, the development of AI big language models in the field of mathematics has great potential significance. To improve the mathematical reasoning ability of large language models, we proposed an agent framework for learning to solve mathematical problems based on inductive reasoning. By emulating the human learning process of generalization of learned information and effective application of previous knowledge in new reasoning tasks, this framework has great performance in the mathematical reasoning process. It improves global accuracy over the baseline method (chain-of-thought) by 20.96% and solves 17.54% of the mathematical problems that the baseline cannot solve. Benefiting from the efficient RETRIEVAL method, our model improves the ability of large language models to efficiently use external knowledge, i.e., the mathematical computation of the model can be based on written procedures. In education, our model can be used as a personalised learning aid, thus reducing the inequality of educational resources.</description>

      <title>Tracking Emotional Dynamics in Chat Conversations: A Hybrid Approach using DistilBERT and Emoji Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-mediated communication has become more important than face-to-face communication in many contexts. Tracking emotional dynamics in chat conversations can enhance communication, improve services, and support well-being in various contexts. This paper explores a hybrid approach to tracking emotional dynamics in chat conversations by combining DistilBERT-based text emotion detection and emoji sentiment analysis. A Twitter dataset was analyzed using various machine learning algorithms, including SVM, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. We contrasted their performance with DistilBERT. Results reveal DistilBERT's superior performance in emotion recognition. Our approach accounts for emotive expressions conveyed through emojis to better understand participants' emotions during chats. We demonstrate how this approach can effectively capture and analyze emotional shifts in real-time conversations. Our findings show that integrating text and emoji analysis is an effective way of tracking chat emotion, with possible applications in customer service, work chats, and social media interactions.</description>

Abstract: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), suicide was the fourth leading cause of death in the world for individuals aged 15 to 29 in 2019. Given the rapid increase in mental health issues, providing psychological support is both crucial and urgent. In this paper: (1) we propose S\'olo Esc\'uchame, the first open-source Spanish emotional assistance chatbot, based on LLaMA-2-7b-Chat. (2) We introduced the HEAR (Hispanic Emotional Accompaniment Responses) dataset, compiled from multiple English sources translated into Spanish, as well as generic data generated using ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo. Finally, (3) we propose an evaluation metric based on two semi-automatic assessment methods. Our system outperforms a range of state-of-the-art models in providing psychological assistance in Spanish. Our models and datasets are publicly available to facilitate reproducibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in comprehending and analyzing lengthy sequential inputs, owing to their extensive context windows that allow processing millions of tokens in a single forward pass. However, this paper uncovers a surprising limitation: LLMs fall short when handling long input sequences. We investigate this issue using three datasets and two tasks (sentiment analysis and news categorization) across various LLMs, including Claude 3, Gemini Pro, GPT 3.5 Turbo, Llama 3 Instruct, and Mistral Instruct models. To address this limitation, we propose and evaluate ad-hoc solutions that substantially enhance LLMs' performance on long input sequences by up to 50%, while reducing API cost and latency by up to 93% and 50%, respectively.</description>

      <title>MALADE: Orchestration of LLM-powered Agents with Retrieval Augmented Generation for Pharmacovigilance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), given their remarkable text understanding and generation abilities, there is an unprecedented opportunity to develop new, LLM-based methods for trustworthy medical knowledge synthesis, extraction and summarization. This paper focuses on the problem of Pharmacovigilance (PhV), where the significance and challenges lie in identifying Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) from diverse text sources, such as medical literature, clinical notes, and drug labels. Unfortunately, this task is hindered by factors including variations in the terminologies of drugs and outcomes, and ADE descriptions often being buried in large amounts of narrative text. We present MALADE, the first effective collaborative multi-agent system powered by LLM with Retrieval Augmented Generation for ADE extraction from drug label data. This technique involves augmenting a query to an LLM with relevant information extracted from text resources, and instructing the LLM to compose a response consistent with the augmented data. MALADE is a general LLM-agnostic architecture, and its unique capabilities are: (1) leveraging a variety of external sources, such as medical literature, drug labels, and FDA tools (e.g., OpenFDA drug information API), (2) extracting drug-outcome association in a structured format along with the strength of the association, and (3) providing explanations for established associations. Instantiated with GPT-4 Turbo or GPT-4o, and FDA drug label data, MALADE demonstrates its efficacy with an Area Under ROC Curve of 0.90 against the OMOP Ground Truth table of ADEs. Our implementation leverages the Langroid multi-agent LLM framework and can be found at https://github.com/jihyechoi77/malade.</description>

      <title>Re-Invoke: Tool Invocation Rewriting for Zero-Shot Tool Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled autonomous agents with complex reasoning and task-fulfillment capabilities using a wide range of tools. However, effectively identifying the most relevant tools for a given task becomes a key bottleneck as the toolset size grows, hindering reliable tool utilization. To address this, we introduce Re-Invoke, an unsupervised tool retrieval method designed to scale effectively to large toolsets without training. Specifically, we first generate a diverse set of synthetic queries that comprehensively cover different aspects of the query space associated with each tool document during the tool indexing phase. Second, we leverage LLM's query understanding capabilities to extract key tool-related context and underlying intents from user queries during the inference phase. Finally, we employ a novel multi-view similarity ranking strategy based on intents to pinpoint the most relevant tools for each query. Our evaluation demonstrates that Re-Invoke significantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in both single-tool and multi-tool scenarios, all within a fully unsupervised setting. Notably, on the ToolE datasets, we achieve a 20% relative improvement in nDCG@5 for single-tool retrieval and a 39% improvement for multi-tool retrieval.</description>

      <title>Cross-layer Attention Sharing for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve, the increase in model depth and parameter number leads to substantial redundancy. To enhance the efficiency of the attention mechanism, previous works primarily compress the KV cache or group attention heads, while largely overlooking redundancy between layers. Our comprehensive analyses across various LLMs show that highly similar attention patterns persist within most layers. It's intuitive to save the computation by sharing attention weights across layers. However, further analysis reveals two challenges: (1) Directly sharing the weight matrix without carefully rearranging the attention heads proves to be ineffective; (2) Shallow layers are vulnerable to small deviations in attention weights. Driven by these insights, we introduce LiSA, a lightweight substitute for self-attention in well-trained LLMs. LiSA employs tiny feed-forward networks to align attention heads between adjacent layers and low-rank matrices to approximate differences in layer-wise attention weights. Evaluations encompassing 13 typical benchmarks demonstrate that LiSA maintains high response quality in terms of accuracy and perplexity while reducing redundant attention calculations within 53-84% of the total layers. Our implementations of LiSA achieve a 6X compression of Q and K, with maximum throughput improvements of 19.5% for LLaMA3-8B and 32.3% for LLaMA2-7B.</description>

      <title>A Semi-supervised Multi-channel Graph Convolutional Network for Query Classification in E-commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query intent classification is an essential module for customers to find desired products on the e-commerce application quickly. Most existing query intent classification methods rely on the users' click behavior as a supervised signal to construct training samples. However, these methods based entirely on posterior labels may lead to serious category imbalance problems because of the Matthew effect in click samples. Compared with popular categories, it is difficult for products under long-tail categories to obtain traffic and user clicks, which makes the models unable to detect users' intent for products under long-tail categories. This in turn aggravates the problem that long-tail categories cannot obtain traffic, forming a vicious circle. In addition, due to the randomness of the user's click, the posterior label is unstable for the query with similar semantics, which makes the model very sensitive to the input, leading to an unstable and incomplete recall of categories.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Multi-channel Graph Convolutional Network (SMGCN) to address the above problems from the perspective of label association and semi-supervised learning. SMGCN extends category information and enhances the posterior label by utilizing the similarity score between the query and categories. Furthermore, it leverages the co-occurrence and semantic similarity graph of categories to strengthen the relations among labels and weaken the influence of posterior label instability. We conduct extensive offline and online A/B experiments, and the experimental results show that SMGCN significantly outperforms the strong baselines, which shows its effectiveness and practicality.</description>

      <title>DiReCT: Diagnostic Reasoning for Clinical Notes via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently showcased remarkable capabilities, spanning a wide range of tasks and applications, including those in the medical domain. Models like GPT-4 excel in medical question answering but may face challenges in the lack of interpretability when handling complex tasks in real clinical settings. We thus introduce the diagnostic reasoning dataset for clinical notes (DiReCT), aiming at evaluating the reasoning ability and interpretability of LLMs compared to human doctors. It contains 521 clinical notes, each meticulously annotated by physicians, detailing the diagnostic reasoning process from observations in a clinical note to the final diagnosis. Additionally, a diagnostic knowledge graph is provided to offer essential knowledge for reasoning, which may not be covered in the training data of existing LLMs. Evaluations of leading LLMs on DiReCT bring out a significant gap between their reasoning ability and that of human doctors, highlighting the critical need for models that can reason effectively in real-world clinical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Defining and Evaluating Decision and Composite Risk in Language Models Applied to Natural Language Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are known to pose important risks. One such set of risks arises from misplaced confidence, whether over-confidence or under-confidence, that the models have in their inference. While the former is well studied, the latter is not, leading to an asymmetry in understanding the comprehensive risk of the model based on misplaced confidence. In this paper, we address this asymmetry by defining two types of risk (decision and composite risk), and proposing an experimental framework consisting of a two-level inference architecture and appropriate metrics for measuring such risks in both discriminative and generative LLMs. The first level relies on a decision rule that determines whether the underlying language model should abstain from inference. The second level (which applies if the model does not abstain) is the model's inference. Detailed experiments on four natural language commonsense reasoning datasets using both an open-source ensemble-based RoBERTa model and ChatGPT, demonstrate the practical utility of the evaluation framework. For example, our results show that our framework can get an LLM to confidently respond to an extra 20.1% of low-risk inference tasks that other methods might misclassify as high-risk, and skip 19.8% of high-risk tasks, which would have been answered incorrectly.</description>

      <title>A Novel Metric for Measuring the Robustness of Large Language Models in Non-adversarial Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the robustness of several large language models on multiple datasets. Robustness here refers to the relative insensitivity of the model's answers to meaning-preserving variants of their input. Benchmark datasets are constructed by introducing naturally-occurring, non-malicious perturbations, or by generating semantically equivalent paraphrases of input questions or statements. We further propose a novel metric for assessing a model robustness, and demonstrate its benefits in the non-adversarial scenario by empirical evaluation of several models on the created datasets.</description>

      <title>ML-EAT: A Multilevel Embedding Association Test for Interpretable and Transparent Social Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research introduces the Multilevel Embedding Association Test (ML-EAT), a method designed for interpretable and transparent measurement of intrinsic bias in language technologies. The ML-EAT addresses issues of ambiguity and difficulty in interpreting the traditional EAT measurement by quantifying bias at three levels of increasing granularity: the differential association between two target concepts with two attribute concepts; the individual effect size of each target concept with two attribute concepts; and the association between each individual target concept and each individual attribute concept. Using the ML-EAT, this research defines a taxonomy of EAT patterns describing the nine possible outcomes of an embedding association test, each of which is associated with a unique EAT-Map, a novel four-quadrant visualization for interpreting the ML-EAT. Empirical analysis of static and diachronic word embeddings, GPT-2 language models, and a CLIP language-and-image model shows that EAT patterns add otherwise unobservable information about the component biases that make up an EAT; reveal the effects of prompting in zero-shot models; and can also identify situations when cosine similarity is an ineffective metric, rendering an EAT unreliable. Our work contributes a method for rendering bias more observable and interpretable, improving the transparency of computational investigations into human minds and societies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As NLP models become increasingly integral to decision-making processes, the need for explainability and interpretability has become paramount. In this work, we propose a framework that achieves the aforementioned by generating semantically edited inputs, known as counterfactual interventions, which change the model prediction, thus providing a form of counterfactual explanations for the model. We test our framework on two NLP tasks - binary sentiment classification and topic classification - and show that the generated edits are contrastive, fluent and minimal, while the whole process remains significantly faster that other state-of-the-art counterfactual editors.</description>

      <title>LLaSA: Large Language and E-Commerce Shopping Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The e-commerce platform has evolved rapidly due to its widespread popularity and convenience. Developing an e-commerce shopping assistant for customers is crucial to aiding them in quickly finding desired products and recommending precisely what they need. However, most previous shopping assistants face two main problems: (1) task-specificity, which necessitates the development of different models for various tasks, thereby increasing development costs and limiting effectiveness; and (2) poor generalization, where the trained model performs inadequately on up-to-date products. To resolve these issues, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct an omnipotent assistant, leveraging their adeptness at handling multiple tasks and their superior generalization capability. Nonetheless, LLMs lack inherent knowledge of e-commerce concepts. To address this, we create an instruction dataset comprising 65,000 samples and diverse tasks, termed as EshopInstruct. Through instruction tuning on our dataset, the assistant, named LLaSA, demonstrates the potential to function as an omnipotent assistant. Additionally, we propose various inference optimization strategies to enhance performance with limited inference resources. In the Amazon KDD Cup 2024 Challenge, our proposed method, LLaSA, achieved an overall ranking of 3rd place on ShopBench, including 57 tasks and approximately 20,000 questions, and we secured top-5 rankings in each track, especially in track4, where we achieved the best performance result among all student teams. Our extensive practices fully demonstrate that LLMs possess the great potential to be competent e-commerce shopping assistants.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning multilingual language models in Twitter/X sentiment analysis: a study on Eastern-European V4 languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a standard NLP task with numerous approaches and benchmarks, where large language models (LLM) represent the current state-of-the-art. We focus on ABSA subtasks based on Twitter/X data in underrepresented languages. On such narrow tasks, small tuned language models can often outperform universal large ones, providing available and cheap solutions.
  We fine-tune several LLMs (BERT, BERTweet, Llama2, Llama3, Mistral) for classification of sentiment towards Russia and Ukraine in the context of the ongoing military conflict. The training/testing dataset was obtained from the academic API from Twitter/X during 2023, narrowed to the languages of the V4 countries (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary). Then we measure their performance under a variety of settings including translations, sentiment targets, in-context learning and more, using GPT4 as a reference model. We document several interesting phenomena demonstrating, among others, that some models are much better fine-tunable on multilingual Twitter tasks than others, and that they can reach the SOTA level with a very small training set. Finally we identify combinations of settings providing the best results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating synthetic text addresses the challenge of data availability in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare. This study explores the applicability of synthetic data in real-world medical settings. We introduce MedSyn, a novel medical text generation framework that integrates large language models with a Medical Knowledge Graph (MKG). We use MKG to sample prior medical information for the prompt and generate synthetic clinical notes with GPT-4 and fine-tuned LLaMA models. We assess the benefit of synthetic data through application in the ICD code prediction task. Our research indicates that synthetic data can increase the classification accuracy of vital and challenging codes by up to 17.8% compared to settings without synthetic data. Furthermore, to provide new data for further research in the healthcare domain, we present the largest open-source synthetic dataset of clinical notes for the Russian language, comprising over 41k samples covering 219 ICD-10 codes.</description>

      <title>Effective Demonstration Annotation for In-Context Learning via Language Model-Based Determinantal Point Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a few-shot learning paradigm that involves learning mappings through input-output pairs and appropriately applying them to new instances. Despite the remarkable ICL capabilities demonstrated by Large Language Models (LLMs), existing works are highly dependent on large-scale labeled support sets, not always feasible in practical scenarios. To refine this approach, we focus primarily on an innovative selective annotation mechanism, which precedes the standard demonstration retrieval. We introduce the Language Model-based Determinant Point Process (LM-DPP) that simultaneously considers the uncertainty and diversity of unlabeled instances for optimal selection. Consequently, this yields a subset for annotation that strikes a trade-off between the two factors. We apply LM-DPP to various language models, including GPT-J, LlaMA, and GPT-3. Experimental results on 9 NLU and 2 Generation datasets demonstrate that LM-DPP can effectively select canonical examples. Further analysis reveals that LLMs benefit most significantly from subsets that are both low uncertainty and high diversity.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Multi-Choice Machine Reading Comprehension: A Survey on Methods and Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a thorough examination of recent developments in the field of multi-choice Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC). Focused on benchmark datasets, methodologies, challenges, and future trajectories, our goal is to offer researchers a comprehensive overview of the current landscape in multi-choice MRC. The analysis delves into 30 existing cloze-style and multiple-choice MRC benchmark datasets, employing a refined classification method based on attributes such as corpus style, domain, complexity, context style, question style, and answer style. This classification system enhances our understanding of each dataset's diverse attributes and categorizes them based on their complexity. Furthermore, the paper categorizes recent methodologies into Fine-tuned and Prompt-tuned methods. Fine-tuned methods involve adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to a specific task through retraining on domain-specific datasets, while prompt-tuned methods use prompts to guide PLM response generation, presenting potential applications in zero-shot or few-shot learning scenarios. By contributing to ongoing discussions, inspiring future research directions, and fostering innovations, this paper aims to propel multi-choice MRC towards new frontiers of achievement.</description>

Abstract: Missing data in tabular dataset is a common issue as the performance of downstream tasks usually depends on the completeness of the training dataset. Previous missing data imputation methods focus on numeric and categorical columns, but we propose a novel end-to-end approach called Table Transformers for Imputing Textual Attributes (TTITA) based on the transformer to impute unstructured textual columns using other columns in the table. We conduct extensive experiments on two Amazon Reviews datasets, and our approach shows competitive performance outperforming baseline models such as recurrent neural networks and Llama2. The performance improvement is more significant when the target sequence has a longer length. Additionally, we incorporated multi-task learning to simultaneously impute for heterogeneous columns, boosting the performance for text imputation. We also qualitatively compare with ChatGPT for realistic applications.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Cultural Representations of Emotions in LLMs through Mixed Emotion Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread global adoption, showcasing advanced linguistic capabilities across multiple of languages. There is a growing interest in academia to use these models to simulate and study human behaviors. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that an LLM's proficiency in a specific language might not fully encapsulate the norms and values associated with its culture. Concerns have emerged regarding potential biases towards Anglo-centric cultures and values due to the predominance of Western and US-based training data. This study focuses on analyzing the cultural representations of emotions in LLMs, in the specific case of mixed-emotion situations. Our methodology is based on the studies of Miyamoto et al. (2010), which identified distinctive emotional indicators in Japanese and American human responses. We first administer their mixed emotion survey to five different LLMs and analyze their outputs. Second, we experiment with contextual variables to explore variations in responses considering both language and speaker origin. Thirdly, we expand our investigation to encompass additional East Asian and Western European origin languages to gauge their alignment with their respective cultures, anticipating a closer fit. We find that (1) models have limited alignment with the evidence in the literature; (2) written language has greater effect on LLMs' response than information on participants origin; and (3) LLMs responses were found more similar for East Asian languages than Western European languages.</description>

      <title>CodeACT: Code Adaptive Compute-efficient Tuning Framework for Code LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in code-related tasks, yet open-source models lag behind their closed-source counterparts. To bridge this performance gap, existing methods generate vast amounts of synthetic data for fine-tuning, leading to inefficiencies in training. Motivated by the need for more effective and efficient training, we propose the Code Adaptive Compute-efficient Tuning (CodeACT) framework. CodeACT introduces the Complexity and Diversity Aware Sampling (CDAS) method to select high-quality training data based on complexity and diversity, and the Dynamic Pack padding strategy to reduce computational resource usage by minimizing padding tokens during training. Experimental results demonstrate that CodeACT-DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B, fine-tuned on only 40% of the EVOL-Instruct data, achieves an 8.6% performance increase on HumanEval, reduces training time by 78%, and decreases peak GPU memory usage by 27%. These findings underscore CodeACT's ability to enhance the performance and efficiency of open-source models. By optimizing both the data selection and training processes, CodeACT offers a comprehensive approach to improving the capabilities of open-source LLMs while significantly reducing computational requirements, addressing the dual challenges of data quality and training efficiency, and paving the way for more resource-efficient and performant models.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Source Heterogeneous Knowledge Injected Prompt Learning Method for Legal Charge Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legal charge prediction, an essential task in legal AI, seeks to assign accurate charge labels to case descriptions, attracting significant recent interest. Existing methods primarily employ diverse neural network structures for modeling case descriptions directly, failing to effectively leverage multi-source external knowledge. We propose a prompt learning framework-based method that simultaneously leverages multi-source heterogeneous external knowledge from a legal knowledge base, a conversational LLM, and related legal articles. Specifically, we match knowledge snippets in case descriptions via the legal knowledge base and encapsulate them into the input through a hard prompt template. Additionally, we retrieve legal articles related to a given case description through contrastive learning, and then obtain factual elements within the case description through a conversational LLM. We fuse the embedding vectors of soft prompt tokens with the encoding vector of factual elements to achieve knowledge-enhanced model forward inference. Experimental results show that our method achieved state-of-the-art results on CAIL-2018, the largest legal charge prediction dataset, and our method has lower data dependency. Case studies also demonstrate our method's strong interpretability.</description>

      <title>Do Large Language Models Speak All Languages Equally? A Comparative Study in Low-Resource Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant interest in natural language processing (NLP), particularly their remarkable performance in various downstream tasks in resource-rich languages. Recent studies have highlighted the limitations of LLMs in low-resource languages, primarily focusing on binary classification tasks and giving minimal attention to South Asian languages. These limitations are primarily attributed to constraints such as dataset scarcity, computational costs, and research gaps specific to low-resource languages. To address this gap, we present datasets for sentiment and hate speech tasks by translating from English to Bangla, Hindi, and Urdu, facilitating research in low-resource language processing. Further, we comprehensively examine zero-shot learning using multiple LLMs in English and widely spoken South Asian languages. Our findings indicate that GPT-4 consistently outperforms Llama 2 and Gemini, with English consistently demonstrating superior performance across diverse tasks compared to low-resource languages. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that natural language inference (NLI) exhibits the highest performance among the evaluated tasks, with GPT-4 demonstrating superior capabilities.</description>

      <title>BOTS-LM: Training Large Language Models for Setswana</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present BOTS-LM, a series of bilingual language models proficient in both Setswana and English. Leveraging recent advancements in data availability and efficient fine-tuning, BOTS-LM achieves performance similar to models significantly larger than itself while maintaining computational efficiency. Our initial release features an 8 billion parameter generative large language model, with upcoming 0.5 billion and 1 billion parameter large language models and a 278 million parameter encoder-only model soon to be released. We find the 8 billion parameter model significantly outperforms Llama-3-70B and Aya 23 on English-Setswana translation tasks, approaching the performance of dedicated machine translation models, while approaching 70B parameter performance on Setswana reasoning as measured by a machine translated subset of the MMLU benchmark. To accompany the BOTS-LM series of language models, we release the largest Setswana web dataset, SetsText, totalling over 267 million tokens. In addition, we release the largest machine translated Setswana dataset, the first and largest synthetic Setswana dataset, training and evaluation code, training logs, and MMLU-tsn, a machine translated subset of MMLU.</description>

      <title>ReDel: A Toolkit for LLM-Powered Recursive Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been increasing interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct complex multi-agent systems to perform tasks such as compiling literature reviews, drafting consumer reports, and planning vacations. Many tools and libraries exist for helping create such systems, however none support recursive multi-agent systems -- where the models themselves flexibly decide when to delegate tasks and how to organize their delegation structure. In this work, we introduce ReDel: a toolkit for recursive multi-agent systems that supports custom tool-use, delegation schemes, event-based logging, and interactive replay in an easy-to-use web interface. We show that, using ReDel, we are able to achieve significant performance gains on agentic benchmarks and easily identify potential areas of improvements through the visualization and debugging tools. Our code, documentation, and PyPI package are open-source and free to use under the MIT license.</description>

      <title>Advancing Post-OCR Correction: A Comparative Study of Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of synthetic data in the post-OCR domain on multiple fronts by conducting experiments to assess the impact of data volume, augmentation, and synthetic data generation methods on model performance. Furthermore, we introduce a novel algorithm that leverages computer vision feature detection algorithms to calculate glyph similarity for constructing post-OCR synthetic data. Through experiments conducted across a variety of languages, including several low-resource ones, we demonstrate that models like ByT5 can significantly reduce Character Error Rates (CER) without the need for manually annotated data, and our proposed synthetic data generation method shows advantages over traditional methods, particularly in low-resource languages.</description>

      <title>To Aggregate or Not to Aggregate. That is the Question: A Case Study on Annotation Subjectivity in Span Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the task of automatic prediction of text spans in a legal problem description that support a legal area label. We use a corpus of problem descriptions written by laypeople in English that is annotated by practising lawyers. Inherent subjectivity exists in our task because legal area categorisation is a complex task, and lawyers often have different views on a problem, especially in the face of legally-imprecise descriptions of issues. Experiments show that training on majority-voted spans outperforms training on disaggregated ones.</description>

      <title>StyEmp: Stylizing Empathetic Response Generation via Multi-Grained Prefix Encoder and Personality Reinforcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent approaches for empathetic response generation mainly focus on emotional resonance and user understanding, without considering the system's personality. Consistent personality is evident in real human expression and is important for creating trustworthy systems. To address this problem, we propose StyEmp, which aims to stylize the empathetic response generation with a consistent personality. Specifically, it incorporates a multi-grained prefix mechanism designed to capture the intricate relationship between a system's personality and its empathetic expressions. Furthermore, we introduce a personality reinforcement module that leverages contrastive learning to calibrate the generation model, ensuring that responses are both empathetic and reflective of a distinct personality. Automatic and human evaluations on the EMPATHETICDIALOGUES benchmark show that StyEmp outperforms competitive baselines in terms of both empathy and personality expressions.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Vocabulary Learning Enables Zero-Shot Translation from Unseen Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual neural machine translation systems learn to map sentences of different languages into a common representation space. Intuitively, with a growing number of seen languages the encoder sentence representation grows more flexible and easily adaptable to new languages. In this work, we test this hypothesis by zero-shot translating from unseen languages. To deal with unknown vocabularies from unknown languages we propose a setup where we decouple learning of vocabulary and syntax, i.e. for each language we learn word representations in a separate step (using cross-lingual word embeddings), and then train to translate while keeping those word representations frozen. We demonstrate that this setup enables zero-shot translation from entirely unseen languages. Zero-shot translating with a model trained on Germanic and Romance languages we achieve scores of 42.6 BLEU for Portuguese-English and 20.7 BLEU for Russian-English on TED domain. We explore how this zero-shot translation capability develops with varying number of languages seen by the encoder. Lastly, we explore the effectiveness of our decoupled learning strategy for unsupervised machine translation. By exploiting our model's zero-shot translation capability for iterative back-translation we attain near parity with a supervised setting.</description>

      <title>SNFinLLM: Systematic and Nuanced Financial Domain Adaptation of Chinese Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become powerful tools for advancing natural language processing applications in the financial industry. However, existing financial LLMs often face challenges such as hallucinations or superficial parameter training, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in financial computing and machine reading comprehension (MRC). To address these issues, we propose a novel large language model specifically designed for the Chinese financial domain, named SNFinLLM. SNFinLLM excels in domain-specific tasks such as answering questions, summarizing financial research reports, analyzing sentiment, and executing financial calculations. We then perform the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance the model's proficiency across various financial domains. Specifically, we gather extensive financial data and create a high-quality instruction dataset composed of news articles, professional papers, and research reports of finance domain. Utilizing both domain-specific and general datasets, we proceed with continuous pre-training on an established open-source base model, resulting in SNFinLLM-base. Following this, we engage in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to bolster the model's capability across multiple financial tasks. Crucially, we employ a straightforward Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) method to better align the model with human preferences. Extensive experiments conducted on finance benchmarks and our evaluation dataset demonstrate that SNFinLLM markedly outperforms other state-of-the-art financial language models.

      <title>Dialogue Ontology Relation Extraction via Constrained Chain-of-Thought Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art task-oriented dialogue systems typically rely on task-specific ontologies for fulfilling user queries. The majority of task-oriented dialogue data, such as customer service recordings, comes without ontology and annotation. Such ontologies are normally built manually, limiting the application of specialised systems. Dialogue ontology construction is an approach for automating that process and typically consists of two steps: term extraction and relation extraction. In this work, we focus on relation extraction in a transfer learning set-up. To improve the generalisation, we propose an extension to the decoding mechanism of large language models. We adapt Chain-of-Thought (CoT) decoding, recently developed for reasoning problems, to generative relation extraction. Here, we generate multiple branches in the decoding space and select the relations based on a confidence threshold. By constraining the decoding to ontology terms and relations, we aim to decrease the risk of hallucination. We conduct extensive experimentation on two widely used datasets and find improvements in performance on target ontology for source fine-tuned and one-shot prompted large language models.</description>

      <title>A Few-Shot Approach for Relation Extraction Domain Adaptation using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been successfully applied to the analysis of complex scientific and technological domains, with automatic KG generation methods typically building upon relation extraction models capturing fine-grained relations between domain entities in text. While these relations are fully applicable across scientific areas, existing models are trained on few domain-specific datasets such as SciERC and do not perform well on new target domains. In this paper, we experiment with leveraging in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models to perform schema-constrained data annotation, collecting in-domain training instances for a Transformer-based relation extraction model deployed on titles and abstracts of research papers in the Architecture, Construction, Engineering and Operations (AECO) domain. By assessing the performance gain with respect to a baseline Deep Learning architecture trained on off-domain data, we show that by using a few-shot learning strategy with structured prompts and only minimal expert annotation the presented approach can potentially support domain adaptation of a science KG generation model.</description>

      <title>Why Are My Prompts Leaked? Unraveling Prompt Extraction Threats in Customized Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The drastic increase of large language models' (LLMs) parameters has led to a new research direction of fine-tuning-free downstream customization by prompts, i.e., task descriptions. While these prompt-based services (e.g. OpenAI's GPTs) play an important role in many businesses, there has emerged growing concerns about the prompt leakage, which undermines the intellectual properties of these services and causes downstream attacks. In this paper, we analyze the underlying mechanism of prompt leakage, which we refer to as prompt memorization, and develop corresponding defending strategies. By exploring the scaling laws in prompt extraction, we analyze key attributes that influence prompt extraction, including model sizes, prompt lengths, as well as the types of prompts. Then we propose two hypotheses that explain how LLMs expose their prompts. The first is attributed to the perplexity, i.e. the familiarity of LLMs to texts, whereas the second is based on the straightforward token translation path in attention matrices. To defend against such threats, we investigate whether alignments can undermine the extraction of prompts. We find that current LLMs, even those with safety alignments like GPT-4, are highly vulnerable to prompt extraction attacks, even under the most straightforward user attacks. Therefore, we put forward several defense strategies with the inspiration of our findings, which achieve 83.8\% and 71.0\% drop in the prompt extraction rate for Llama2-7B and GPT-3.5, respectively.

      <title>Infusing Emotions into Task-oriented Dialogue Systems: Understanding, Management, and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotions are indispensable in human communication, but are often overlooked in task-oriented dialogue (ToD) modelling, where the task success is the primary focus. While existing works have explored user emotions or similar concepts in some ToD tasks, none has so far included emotion modelling into a fully-fledged ToD system nor conducted interaction with human or simulated users. In this work, we incorporate emotion into the complete ToD processing loop, involving understanding, management, and generation. To this end, we extend the EmoWOZ dataset (Feng et al., 2022) with system affective behaviour labels. Through interactive experimentation involving both simulated and human users, we demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly enhances the user's emotional experience as well as the task success.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have fostered the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) that can solve an immense variety of tasks. One of the key aspects of their application is their ability to work with long text documents and to process long sequences of tokens. This has created a demand for proper evaluation of long-context understanding. To address this need for the Russian language, we propose LIBRA (Long Input Benchmark for Russian Analysis), which comprises 21 adapted datasets to study the LLM's abilities to understand long texts thoroughly. The tests are divided into four complexity groups and allow the evaluation of models across various context lengths ranging from 4k up to 128k tokens. We provide the open-source datasets, codebase, and public leaderboard for LIBRA to guide forthcoming research.</description>

Abstract: Structured generation, the process of producing content in standardized formats like JSON and XML, is widely utilized in real-world applications to extract key output information from large language models (LLMs). This study investigates whether such constraints on generation space impact LLMs' abilities, including reasoning and domain knowledge comprehension. Specifically, we evaluate LLMs' performance when restricted to adhere to structured formats versus generating free-form responses across various common tasks. Surprisingly, we observe a significant decline in LLMs' reasoning abilities under format restrictions. Furthermore, we find that stricter format constraints generally lead to greater performance degradation in reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>UnifiedMLLM: Enabling Unified Representation for Multi-modal Multi-tasks With Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant advancements has recently been achieved in the field of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), demonstrating their remarkable capabilities in understanding and reasoning across diverse tasks. However, these models are often trained for specific tasks and rely on task-specific input-output formats, limiting their applicability to a broader range of tasks. This raises a fundamental question: Can we develop a unified approach to represent and handle different multi-modal tasks to maximize the generalizability of MLLMs? In this paper, we propose UnifiedMLLM, a comprehensive model designed to represent various tasks using a unified representation. Our model exhibits strong capabilities in comprehending the implicit intent of user instructions and preforming reasoning. In addition to generating textual responses, our model also outputs task tokens and grounding tokens, serving as indicators of task types and task granularity. These outputs are subsequently routed through the task router and directed to specific expert models for task completion. To train our model, we construct a task-specific dataset and an 100k multi-task dataset encompassing complex scenarios. Employing a three-stage training strategy, we equip our model with robust reasoning and task processing capabilities while preserving its generalization capacity and knowledge reservoir. Extensive experiments showcase the impressive performance of our unified representation approach across various tasks, surpassing existing methodologies. Furthermore, our approach exhibits exceptional scalability and generality. Our code, model, and dataset will be available at \url{https://github.com/lzw-lzw/UnifiedMLLM}.</description>

      <title>OneLove beyond the field -- A few-shot pipeline for topic and sentiment analysis during the FIFA World Cup in Qatar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FIFA World Cup in Qatar was discussed extensively in the news and on social media. Due to news reports with allegations of human rights violations, there were calls to boycott it. Wearing a OneLove armband was part of a planned protest activity. Controversy around the armband arose when FIFA threatened to sanction captains who wear it. To understand what topics Twitter users Tweeted about and what the opinion of German Twitter users was towards the OneLove armband, we performed an analysis of German Tweets published during the World Cup using in-context learning with LLMs. We validated the labels on human annotations. We found that Twitter users initially discussed the armband's impact, LGBT rights, and politics; after the ban, the conversation shifted towards politics in sports in general, accompanied by a subtle shift in sentiment towards neutrality. Our evaluation serves as a framework for future research to explore the impact of sports activism and evolving public sentiment. This is especially useful in settings where labeling datasets for specific opinions is unfeasible, such as when events are unfolding.</description>

      <title>Caution for the Environment: Multimodal Agents are Susceptible to Environmental Distractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the faithfulness of multimodal large language model (MLLM) agents in the graphical user interface (GUI) environment, aiming to address the research question of whether multimodal GUI agents can be distracted by environmental context. A general setting is proposed where both the user and the agent are benign, and the environment, while not malicious, contains unrelated content. A wide range of MLLMs are evaluated as GUI agents using our simulated dataset, following three working patterns with different levels of perception. Experimental results reveal that even the most powerful models, whether generalist agents or specialist GUI agents, are susceptible to distractions. While recent studies predominantly focus on the helpfulness (i.e., action accuracy) of multimodal agents, our findings indicate that these agents are prone to environmental distractions, resulting in unfaithful behaviors. Furthermore, we switch to the adversarial perspective and implement environment injection, demonstrating that such unfaithfulness can be exploited, leading to unexpected risks.</description>

      <title>RAG Foundry: A Framework for Enhancing LLMs for Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is inherently complex, requiring deep understanding of data, use cases, and intricate design decisions. Additionally, evaluating these systems presents significant challenges, necessitating assessment of both retrieval accuracy and generative quality through a multi-faceted approach. We introduce RAG Foundry, an open-source framework for augmenting large language models for RAG use cases. RAG Foundry integrates data creation, training, inference and evaluation into a single workflow, facilitating the creation of data-augmented datasets for training and evaluating large language models in RAG settings. This integration enables rapid prototyping and experimentation with various RAG techniques, allowing users to easily generate datasets and train RAG models using internal or specialized knowledge sources. We demonstrate the framework effectiveness by augmenting and fine-tuning Llama-3 and Phi-3 models with diverse RAG configurations, showcasing consistent improvements across three knowledge-intensive datasets. Code is released as open-source in https://github.com/IntelLabs/RAGFoundry.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Enhancing LLMs Agent based on Theory of Mind in Guandan: A Multi-Player Cooperative Game under Imperfect Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown success in handling simple games with imperfect information and enabling multi-agent coordination, but their ability to facilitate practical collaboration against other agents in complex, imperfect information environments, especially in a non-English environment, still needs to be explored. This study investigates the applicability of knowledge acquired by open-source and API-based LLMs to sophisticated text-based games requiring agent collaboration under imperfect information, comparing their performance to established baselines using other types of agents. We propose a Theory of Mind (ToM) planning technique that allows LLM agents to adapt their strategy against various adversaries using only game rules, current state, and historical context as input. An external tool was incorporated to mitigate the challenge of dynamic and extensive action spaces in this card game. Our results show that although a performance gap exists between current LLMs and state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) models, LLMs demonstrate ToM capabilities in this game setting. It consistently improves their performance against opposing agents, suggesting their ability to understand the actions of allies and adversaries and establish collaboration with allies. To encourage further research and understanding, we have made our codebase openly accessible.</description>

      <title>Leveraging the Power of LLMs: A Fine-Tuning Approach for High-Quality Aspect-Based Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-increasing volume of digital information necessitates efficient methods for users to extract key insights from lengthy documents. Aspect-based summarization offers a targeted approach, generating summaries focused on specific aspects within a document. Despite advancements in aspect-based summarization research, there is a continuous quest for improved model performance. Given that large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the potential to revolutionize diverse tasks within natural language processing, particularly in the problem of summarization, this paper explores the potential of fine-tuning LLMs for the aspect-based summarization task. We evaluate the impact of fine-tuning open-source foundation LLMs, including Llama2, Mistral, Gemma and Aya, on a publicly available domain-specific aspect based summary dataset. We hypothesize that this approach will enable these models to effectively identify and extract aspect-related information, leading to superior quality aspect-based summaries compared to the state-of-the-art. We establish a comprehensive evaluation framework to compare the performance of fine-tuned LLMs against competing aspect-based summarization methods and vanilla counterparts of the fine-tuned LLMs. Our work contributes to the field of aspect-based summarization by demonstrating the efficacy of fine-tuning LLMs for generating high-quality aspect-based summaries. Furthermore, it opens doors for further exploration of using LLMs for targeted information extraction tasks across various NLP domains.</description>

      <title>Progressively Selective Label Enhancement for Language Model Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various language tasks but may produce content that misaligns with human expectations, raising ethical and legal concerns. Therefore, it is important to explore the limitations and implement restrictions on the models to ensure safety and compliance, with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) being the primary method. Due to challenges in stability and scalability with the RLHF stages, researchers are exploring alternative methods to achieve effects comparable to those of RLHF. However, these methods often depend on large high-quality datasets and inefficiently utilize generated data. To deal with this problem, we propose PSLE, i.e., Progressively Selective Label Enhancement for Language Model Alignment, a framework that fully utilizes all generated data by guiding the model with principles to align outputs with human expectations. Using a dynamically updated threshold, our approach ensures efficient data utilization by incorporating all generated responses and weighting them based on their corresponding reward scores. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PSLE compared to existing language model alignment methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing (NLP) in biology hinges on models' ability to interpret intricate biomedical literature. Traditional models often struggle with the complex and domain-specific language in this field. In this paper, we present BioMamba, a pre-trained model specifically designed for biomedical text mining. BioMamba builds upon the Mamba architecture and is pre-trained on an extensive corpus of biomedical literature. Our empirical studies demonstrate that BioMamba significantly outperforms models like BioBERT and general-domain Mamba across various biomedical tasks. For instance, BioMamba achieves a 100 times reduction in perplexity and a 4 times reduction in cross-entropy loss on the BioASQ test set. We provide an overview of the model architecture, pre-training process, and fine-tuning techniques. Additionally, we release the code and trained model to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>Language Model Can Listen While Speaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dialogue serves as the most natural manner of human-computer interaction (HCI). Recent advancements in speech language models (SLM) have significantly enhanced speech-based conversational AI. However, these models are limited to turn-based conversation, lacking the ability to interact with humans in real-time spoken scenarios, for example, being interrupted when the generated content is not satisfactory. To address these limitations, we explore full duplex modeling (FDM) in interactive speech language models (iSLM), focusing on enhancing real-time interaction and, more explicitly, exploring the quintessential ability of interruption. We introduce a novel model design, namely listening-while-speaking language model (LSLM), an end-to-end system equipped with both listening and speaking channels. Our LSLM employs a token-based decoder-only TTS for speech generation and a streaming self-supervised learning (SSL) encoder for real-time audio input. LSLM fuses both channels for autoregressive generation and detects turn-taking in real time. Three fusion strategies -- early fusion, middle fusion, and late fusion -- are explored, with middle fusion achieving an optimal balance between speech generation and real-time interaction. Two experimental settings, command-based FDM and voice-based FDM, demonstrate LSLM's robustness to noise and sensitivity to diverse instructions. Our results highlight LSLM's capability to achieve duplex communication with minimal impact on existing systems. This study aims to advance the development of interactive speech dialogue systems, enhancing their applicability in real-world contexts.</description>

      <title>SEAS: Self-Evolving Adversarial Safety Optimization for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capability and influence, ensuring their security and preventing harmful outputs has become crucial. A promising approach to address these concerns involves training models to automatically generate adversarial prompts for red teaming. However, the evolving subtlety of vulnerabilities in LLMs challenges the effectiveness of current adversarial methods, which struggle to specifically target and explore the weaknesses of these models. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the $\mathbf{S}\text{elf-}\mathbf{E}\text{volving }\mathbf{A}\text{dversarial }\mathbf{S}\text{afety }\mathbf{(SEAS)}$ optimization framework, which enhances security by leveraging data generated by the model itself. SEAS operates through three iterative stages: Initialization, Attack, and Adversarial Optimization, refining both the Red Team and Target models to improve robustness and safety. This framework reduces reliance on manual testing and significantly enhances the security capabilities of LLMs. Our contributions include a novel adversarial framework, a comprehensive safety dataset, and after three iterations, the Target model achieves a security level comparable to GPT-4, while the Red Team model shows a marked increase in attack success rate (ASR) against advanced models.</description>

      <title>Can Reinforcement Learning Unlock the Hidden Dangers in Aligned Large Language Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language tasks, but their safety and morality remain contentious due to their training on internet text corpora. To address these concerns, alignment techniques have been developed to improve the public usability and safety of LLMs. Yet, the potential for generating harmful content through these models seems to persist. This paper explores the concept of jailbreaking LLMs-reversing their alignment through adversarial triggers. Previous methods, such as soft embedding prompts, manually crafted prompts, and gradient-based automatic prompts, have had limited success on black-box models due to their requirements for model access and for producing a low variety of manually crafted prompts, making them susceptible to being blocked. This paper introduces a novel approach using reinforcement learning to optimize adversarial triggers, requiring only inference API access to the target model and a small surrogate model. Our method, which leverages a BERTScore-based reward function, enhances the transferability and effectiveness of adversarial triggers on new black-box models. We demonstrate that this approach improves the performance of adversarial triggers on a previously untested language model.</description>

      <title>Self-Taught Evaluators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-based evaluation is at the heart of successful model development -- as a reward model for training, and as a replacement for human evaluation. To train such evaluators, the standard approach is to collect a large amount of human preference judgments over model responses, which is costly and the data becomes stale as models improve. In this work, we present an approach that aims to im-prove evaluators without human annotations, using synthetic training data only. Starting from unlabeled instructions, our iterative self-improvement scheme generates contrasting model outputs and trains an LLM-as-a-Judge to produce reasoning traces and final judgments, repeating this training at each new iteration using the improved predictions. Without any labeled preference data, our Self-Taught Evaluator can improve a strong LLM (Llama3-70B-Instruct) from 75.4 to 88.3 (88.7 with majority vote) on RewardBench. This outperforms commonly used LLM judges such as GPT-4 and matches the performance of the top-performing reward models trained with labeled examples.</description>

      <title>ANNA: Abstractive Text-to-Image Synthesis with Filtered News Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02160v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in Text-to-Image synthesis over recent years have focused more on improving the quality of generated samples using datasets with descriptive prompts. However, real-world image-caption pairs present in domains such as news data do not use simple and directly descriptive captions. With captions containing information on both the image content and underlying contextual cues, they become abstractive in nature. In this paper, we launch ANNA, an Abstractive News captioNs dAtaset extracted from online news articles in a variety of different contexts. We explore the capabilities of current Text-to-Image synthesis models to generate news domain-specific images using abstractive captions by benchmarking them on ANNA, in both standard training and transfer learning settings. The generated images are judged on the basis of contextual relevance, visual quality, and perceptual similarity to ground-truth image-caption pairs. Through our experiments, we show that techniques such as transfer learning achieve limited success in understanding abstractive captions but still fail to consistently learn the relationships between content and context features. The Dataset is available at https://github.com/aashish2000/ANNA .</description>

      <title>Reporting and Analysing the Environmental Impact of Language Models on the Example of Commonsense Question Answering with External Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-produced emissions are growing at an alarming rate, causing already observable changes in the climate and environment in general. Each year global carbon dioxide emissions hit a new record, and it is reported that 0.5% of total US greenhouse gas emissions are attributed to data centres as of 2021. The release of ChatGPT in late 2022 sparked social interest in Large Language Models (LLMs), the new generation of Language Models with a large number of parameters and trained on massive amounts of data. Currently, numerous companies are releasing products featuring various LLMs, with many more models in development and awaiting release. Deep Learning research is a competitive field, with only models that reach top performance attracting attention and being utilized. Hence, achieving better accuracy and results is often the first priority, while the model's efficiency and the environmental impact of the study are neglected. However, LLMs demand substantial computational resources and are very costly to train, both financially and environmentally. It becomes essential to raise awareness and promote conscious decisions about algorithmic and hardware choices. Providing information on training time, the approximate carbon dioxide emissions and power consumption would assist future studies in making necessary adjustments and determining the compatibility of available computational resources with model requirements. In this study, we infused T5 LLM with external knowledge and fine-tuned the model for Question-Answering task. Furthermore, we calculated and reported the approximate environmental impact for both steps. The findings demonstrate that the smaller models may not always be sustainable options, and increased training does not always imply better performance. The most optimal outcome is achieved by carefully considering both performance and efficiency factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing school bullying effectively and promptly is crucial for the mental health of students. This study examined the potential of large language models (LLMs) to empower students by discerning between bullying and joking in school peer interactions. We employed ChatGPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3 Opus, evaluating their effectiveness through human review. Our results revealed that not all LLMs were suitable for an agentic approach, with ChatGPT-4 showing the most promise. We observed variations in LLM outputs, possibly influenced by political overcorrectness, context window limitations, and pre-existing bias in their training data. ChatGPT-4 excelled in context-specific accuracy after implementing the agentic approach, highlighting its potential to provide continuous, real-time support to vulnerable students. This study underlines the significant social impact of using agentic AI in educational settings, offering a new avenue for reducing the negative consequences of bullying and enhancing student well-being.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) requires robust evaluation of their alignment with local values and ethical standards, especially as existing benchmarks often reflect the cultural, legal, and ideological values of their creators. \textsc{LocalValueBench}, introduced in this paper, is an extensible benchmark designed to assess LLMs' adherence to Australian values, and provides a framework for regulators worldwide to develop their own LLM benchmarks for local value alignment. Employing a novel typology for ethical reasoning and an interrogation approach, we curated comprehensive questions and utilized prompt engineering strategies to probe LLMs' value alignment. Our evaluation criteria quantified deviations from local values, ensuring a rigorous assessment process. Comparative analysis of three commercial LLMs by USA vendors revealed significant insights into their effectiveness and limitations, demonstrating the critical importance of value alignment. This study offers valuable tools and methodologies for regulators to create tailored benchmarks, highlighting avenues for future research to enhance ethical AI development.</description>

      <title>Self-Emotion Blended Dialogue Generation in Social Simulation Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When engaging in conversations, dialogue agents in a virtual simulation environment may exhibit their own emotional states that are unrelated to the immediate conversational context, a phenomenon known as self-emotion. This study explores how such self-emotion affects the agents' behaviors in dialogue strategies and decision-making within a large language model (LLM)-driven simulation framework. In a dialogue strategy prediction experiment, we analyze the dialogue strategy choices employed by agents both with and without self-emotion, comparing them to those of humans. The results show that incorporating self-emotion helps agents exhibit more human-like dialogue strategies. In an independent experiment comparing the performance of models fine-tuned on GPT-4 generated dialogue datasets, we demonstrate that self-emotion can lead to better overall naturalness and humanness. Finally, in a virtual simulation environment where agents have discussions on multiple topics, we show that self-emotion of agents can significantly influence the decision-making process of the agents, leading to approximately a 50% change in decisions.</description>

      <title>Integrating Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs for Extraction and Validation of Textual Test Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aerospace manufacturing companies, such as Thales Alenia Space, design, develop, integrate, verify, and validate products characterized by high complexity and low volume. They carefully document all phases for each product but analyses across products are challenging due to the heterogeneity and unstructured nature of the data in documents. In this paper, we propose a hybrid methodology that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) in conjunction with Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract and validate data contained in these documents. We consider a case study focused on test data related to electronic boards for satellites. To do so, we extend the Semantic Sensor Network ontology. We store the metadata of the reports in a KG, while the actual test results are stored in parquet accessible via a Virtual Knowledge Graph. The validation process is managed using an LLM-based approach. We also conduct a benchmarking study to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in executing this task. Finally, we analyze the costs and benefits of automating preexisting processes of manual data extraction and validation for subsequent cross-report analyses.</description>

      <title>STBLLM: Breaking the 1-Bit Barrier with Structured Binary LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present STBLLM, the first structural binarization framework for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) to less than 1-bit precision. LLMs have achieved remarkable performance, but their heavy memory requirements have hindered widespread adoption, particularly on resource-constrained devices. Binarization, which quantifies weights to a mere 1-bit, achieves a milestone in increasing computational efficiency. However, we observe that some weights in binarized LLMs can be randomly flipped without significant performance degradation, indicating the potential for further compression. To exploit this, our STBLLM employs an N:M sparsity to perform structural binarization of the weights. First, we introduce a new Standardized Importance (SI) metric that considers weight magnitude and input feature norm to better evaluate weight significance. Then, we propose a layer-wise approach where different layers of the LLM can be sparsified with varying N:M ratios, balancing compression and accuracy. Finally, we use residual approximation with double binarization to preserve information for salient weights. In addition, we utilize a fine-grained grouping strategy for less important weights that applies different quantization schemes to sparse, intermediate, and dense regions. We conduct extensive experiments on various language models, including the LLaMA-1/2/3, OPT family, and Mistral, to evaluate the effectiveness of STBLLM. The results demonstrate that our approach performs better than other compressed binarization LLM methods while significantly reducing memory requirements.</description>

      <title>Brief state of the art in social information mining: Practical application in analysis of trends in French legislative 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of social media information has undergone significant evolution in the last decade due to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). This paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art techniques in social media mining, with a practical application in analyzing trends in the 2024 French legislative elections. We leverage natural language processing (NLP) tools to gauge public opinion by extracting and analyzing comments and reactions from the AgoraVox platform. The study reveals that the National Rally party, led by Marine Le Pen, maintains a high level of engagement on social media, outperforming traditional parties. This trend is corroborated by user interactions, indicating a strong digital presence. The results highlight the utility of advanced AI models, such as transformers and large language models (LLMs), in capturing nuanced public sentiments and predicting political leanings, demonstrating their potential in real-time reputation management and crisis response.</description>

      <title>Why Perturbing Symbolic Music is Necessary: Fitting the Distribution of Never-used Notes through a Joint Probabilistic Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing music generation models are mostly language-based, neglecting the frequency continuity property of notes, resulting in inadequate fitting of rare or never-used notes and thus reducing the diversity of generated samples. We argue that the distribution of notes can be modeled by translational invariance and periodicity, especially using diffusion models to generalize notes by injecting frequency-domain Gaussian noise. However, due to the low-density nature of music symbols, estimating the distribution of notes latent in the high-density solution space poses significant challenges. To address this problem, we introduce the Music-Diff architecture, which fits a joint distribution of notes and accompanying semantic information to generate symbolic music conditionally. We first enhance the fragmentation module for extracting semantics by using event-based notations and the structural similarity index, thereby preventing boundary blurring. As a prerequisite for multivariate perturbation, we introduce a joint pre-training method to construct the progressions between notes and musical semantics while avoiding direct modeling of low-density notes. Finally, we recover the perturbed notes by a multi-branch denoiser that fits multiple noise objectives via Pareto optimization. Our experiments suggest that in contrast to language models, joint probability diffusion models perturbing at both note and semantic levels can provide more sample diversity and compositional regularity. The case study highlights the rhythmic advantages of our model over language- and DDPMs-based models by analyzing the hierarchical structure expressed in the self-similarity metrics.</description>

      <title>Dataset Scale and Societal Consistency Mediate Facial Impression Bias in Vision-Language AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal AI models capable of associating images and text hold promise for numerous domains, ranging from automated image captioning to accessibility applications for blind and low-vision users. However, uncertainty about bias has in some cases limited their adoption and availability. In the present work, we study 43 CLIP vision-language models to determine whether they learn human-like facial impression biases, and we find evidence that such biases are reflected across three distinct CLIP model families. We show for the first time that the the degree to which a bias is shared across a society predicts the degree to which it is reflected in a CLIP model. Human-like impressions of visually unobservable attributes, like trustworthiness and sexuality, emerge only in models trained on the largest dataset, indicating that a better fit to uncurated cultural data results in the reproduction of increasingly subtle social biases. Moreover, we use a hierarchical clustering approach to show that dataset size predicts the extent to which the underlying structure of facial impression bias resembles that of facial impression bias in humans. Finally, we show that Stable Diffusion models employing CLIP as a text encoder learn facial impression biases, and that these biases intersect with racial biases in Stable Diffusion XL-Turbo. While pretrained CLIP models may prove useful for scientific studies of bias, they will also require significant dataset curation when intended for use as general-purpose models in a zero-shot setting.</description>

      <title>Representation Bias of Adolescents in AI: A Bilingual, Bicultural Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Popular and news media often portray teenagers with sensationalism, as both a risk to society and at risk from society. As AI begins to absorb some of the epistemic functions of traditional media, we study how teenagers in two countries speaking two languages: 1) are depicted by AI, and 2) how they would prefer to be depicted. Specifically, we study the biases about teenagers learned by static word embeddings (SWEs) and generative language models (GLMs), comparing these with the perspectives of adolescents living in the U.S. and Nepal. We find English-language SWEs associate teenagers with societal problems, and more than 50% of the 1,000 words most associated with teenagers in the pretrained GloVe SWE reflect such problems. Given prompts about teenagers, 30% of outputs from GPT2-XL and 29% from LLaMA-2-7B GLMs discuss societal problems, most commonly violence, but also drug use, mental illness, and sexual taboo. Nepali models, while not free of such associations, are less dominated by social problems. Data from workshops with N=13 U.S. adolescents and N=18 Nepalese adolescents show that AI presentations are disconnected from teenage life, which revolves around activities like school and friendship. Participant ratings of how well 20 trait words describe teens are decorrelated from SWE associations, with Pearson's r=.02, n.s. in English FastText and r=.06, n.s. in GloVe; and r=.06, n.s. in Nepali FastText and r=-.23, n.s. in GloVe. U.S. participants suggested AI could fairly present teens by highlighting diversity, while Nepalese participants centered positivity. Participants were optimistic that, if it learned from adolescents, rather than media sources, AI could help mitigate stereotypes. Our work offers an understanding of the ways SWEs and GLMs misrepresent a developmentally vulnerable group and provides a template for less sensationalized characterization.</description>

      <title>The Implications of Open Generative Models in Human-Centered Data Science Work: A Case Study with Fact-Checking Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calls to use open generative language models in academic research have highlighted the need for reproducibility and transparency in scientific research. However, the impact of generative AI extends well beyond academia, as corporations and public interest organizations have begun integrating these models into their data science pipelines. We expand this lens to include the impact of open models on organizations, focusing specifically on fact-checking organizations, which use AI to observe and analyze large volumes of circulating misinformation, yet must also ensure the reproducibility and impartiality of their work. We wanted to understand where fact-checking organizations use open models in their data science pipelines; what motivates their use of open models or proprietary models; and how their use of open or proprietary models can inform research on the societal impact of generative AI. To answer these questions, we conducted an interview study with N=24 professionals at 20 fact-checking organizations on six continents. Based on these interviews, we offer a five-component conceptual model of where fact-checking organizations employ generative AI to support or automate parts of their data science pipeline, including Data Ingestion, Data Analysis, Data Retrieval, Data Delivery, and Data Sharing. We then provide taxonomies of fact-checking organizations' motivations for using open models and the limitations that prevent them for further adopting open models, finding that they prefer open models for Organizational Autonomy, Data Privacy and Ownership, Application Specificity, and Capability Transparency. However, they nonetheless use proprietary models due to perceived advantages in Performance, Usability, and Safety, as well as Opportunity Costs related to participation in emerging generative AI ecosystems. Our work provides novel perspective on open models in data-driven organizations.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Power of Data Tsunami: A Comprehensive Survey on Data Assessment and Selection for Instruction Tuning of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning plays a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Despite the vast amount of open instruction datasets, naively training a LLM on all existing instructions may not be optimal and practical. To pinpoint the most beneficial datapoints, data assessment and selection methods have been proposed in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. However, under the context of instruction tuning, there still exists a gap in knowledge on what kind of data evaluation metrics can be employed and how they can be integrated into the selection mechanism. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive review on existing literature of data assessment and selection especially for instruction tuning of LLMs. We systematically categorize all applicable methods into quality-based, diversity-based, and importance-based ones where a unified, fine-grained taxonomy is structured. For each category, representative methods are elaborated to describe the landscape of relevant research. In addition, comparison between latest methods is conducted on their officially reported results to provide in-depth discussions on their limitations. Finally, we summarize the open challenges and propose the promosing avenues for future studies.

      <title>Generative Retrieval with Few-shot Indexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing generative retrieval (GR) approaches rely on training-based indexing, i.e., fine-tuning a model to memorise the associations between a query and the document identifier (docid) of a relevant document. Training-based indexing has three limitations: high training overhead, under-utilization of the pre-trained knowledge of large language models (LLMs), and challenges in adapting to a dynamic document corpus. To address the above issues, we propose a novel few-shot indexing-based GR framework (Few-Shot GR). It has a novel few-shot indexing process, where we prompt an LLM to generate docids for all documents in a corpus, ultimately creating a docid bank for the entire corpus. During retrieval, we feed a query to the same LLM and constrain it to generate a docid within the docid bank created during indexing, and then map the generated docid back to its corresponding document. Few-Shot GR relies solely on prompting an LLM without requiring any training, making it more efficient. Moreover, we devise few-shot indexing with one-to-many mapping to further enhance Few-Shot GR. Experiments show that Few-Shot GR achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art GR methods that require heavy training.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Performance of Large Language Models for SDG Mapping (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) is expanding rapidly, and open-source versions are becoming available, offering users safer and more adaptable options. These models enable users to protect data privacy by eliminating the need to provide data to third parties and can be customized for specific tasks. In this study, we compare the performance of various language models on the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) mapping task, using the output of GPT-4o as the baseline. The selected open-source models for comparison include Mixtral, LLaMA 2, LLaMA 3, Gemma, and Qwen2. Additionally, GPT-4o-mini, a more specialized version of GPT-4o, was included to extend the comparison. Given the multi-label nature of the SDG mapping task, we employed metrics such as F1 score, precision, and recall with micro-averaging to evaluate different aspects of the models' performance. These metrics are derived from the confusion matrix to ensure a comprehensive evaluation. We provide a clear observation and analysis of each model's performance by plotting curves based on F1 score, precision, and recall at different thresholds. According to the results of this experiment, LLaMA 2 and Gemma still have significant room for improvement. The other four models do not exhibit particularly large differences in performance. The outputs from all seven models are available on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12789375.</description>

      <title>COM Kitchens: An Unedited Overhead-view Video Dataset as a Vision-Language Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Procedural video understanding is gaining attention in the vision and language community. Deep learning-based video analysis requires extensive data. Consequently, existing works often use web videos as training resources, making it challenging to query instructional contents from raw video observations. To address this issue, we propose a new dataset, COM Kitchens. The dataset consists of unedited overhead-view videos captured by smartphones, in which participants performed food preparation based on given recipes. Fixed-viewpoint video datasets often lack environmental diversity due to high camera setup costs. We used modern wide-angle smartphone lenses to cover cooking counters from sink to cooktop in an overhead view, capturing activity without in-person assistance. With this setup, we collected a diverse dataset by distributing smartphones to participants. With this dataset, we propose the novel video-to-text retrieval task Online Recipe Retrieval (OnRR) and new video captioning domain Dense Video Captioning on unedited Overhead-View videos (DVC-OV). Our experiments verified the capabilities and limitations of current web-video-based SOTA methods in handling these tasks.</description>

      <title>Spin glass model of in-context learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models show a surprising in-context learning ability -- being able to use a prompt to form a prediction for a query, yet without additional training, in stark contrast to old-fashioned supervised learning. Providing a mechanistic interpretation and linking the empirical phenomenon to physics are thus challenging and remain unsolved. We study a simple yet expressive transformer with linear attention, and map this structure to a spin glass model with real-valued spins, where the couplings and fields explain the intrinsic disorder in data. The spin glass model explains how the weight parameters interact with each other during pre-training, and most importantly why an unseen function can be predicted by providing only a prompt yet without training. Our theory reveals that for single instance learning, increasing the task diversity leads to the emergence of the in-context learning, by allowing the Boltzmann distribution to converge to a unique correct solution of weight parameters. Therefore the pre-trained transformer displays a prediction power in a novel prompt setting. The proposed spin glass model thus establishes a foundation to understand the empirical success of large language models.</description>

      <title>Developing PUGG for Polish: A Modern Approach to KBQA, MRC, and IR Dataset Construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in AI and natural language processing have revolutionized machine-human language interactions, with question answering (QA) systems playing a pivotal role. The knowledge base question answering (KBQA) task, utilizing structured knowledge graphs (KG), allows for handling extensive knowledge-intensive questions. However, a significant gap exists in KBQA datasets, especially for low-resource languages. Many existing construction pipelines for these datasets are outdated and inefficient in human labor, and modern assisting tools like Large Language Models (LLM) are not utilized to reduce the workload. To address this, we have designed and implemented a modern, semi-automated approach for creating datasets, encompassing tasks such as KBQA, Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC), and Information Retrieval (IR), tailored explicitly for low-resource environments. We executed this pipeline and introduced the PUGG dataset, the first Polish KBQA dataset, and novel datasets for MRC and IR. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive implementation, insightful findings, detailed statistics, and evaluation of baseline models.</description>

      <title>An approach to optimize inference of the DIART speaker diarization pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaker diarization answers the question "who spoke when" for an audio file. In some diarization scenarios, low latency is required for transcription. Speaker diarization with low latency is referred to as online speaker diarization. The DIART pipeline is an online speaker diarization system. It consists of a segmentation and an embedding model. The embedding model has the largest share of the overall latency. The aim of this paper is to optimize the inference latency of the DIART pipeline. Different inference optimization methods such as knowledge distilation, pruning, quantization and layer fusion are applied to the embedding model of the pipeline. It turns out that knowledge distillation optimizes the latency, but has a negative effect on the accuracy. Quantization and layer fusion also have a positive influence on the latency without worsening the accuracy. Pruning, on the other hand, does not improve latency.</description>

      <title>From LLMs to LLM-based Agents for Software Engineering: A Survey of Current, Challenges and Future</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), researchers are increasingly exploring their applications in var ious vertical domains, such as software engineering. LLMs have achieved remarkable success in areas including code generation and vulnerability detection. However, they also exhibit numerous limitations and shortcomings. LLM-based agents, a novel tech nology with the potential for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), combine LLMs as the core for decision-making and action-taking, addressing some of the inherent limitations of LLMs such as lack of autonomy and self-improvement. Despite numerous studies and surveys exploring the possibility of using LLMs in software engineering, it lacks a clear distinction between LLMs and LLM based agents. It is still in its early stage for a unified standard and benchmarking to qualify an LLM solution as an LLM-based agent in its domain. In this survey, we broadly investigate the current practice and solutions for LLMs and LLM-based agents for software engineering. In particular we summarise six key topics: requirement engineering, code generation, autonomous decision-making, software design, test generation, and software maintenance. We review and differentiate the work of LLMs and LLM-based agents from these six topics, examining their differences and similarities in tasks, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss the models and benchmarks used, providing a comprehensive analysis of their applications and effectiveness in software engineering. We anticipate this work will shed some lights on pushing the boundaries of LLM-based agents in software engineering for future research.</description>

      <title>From Retrieval to Generation: Efficient and Effective Entity Set Expansion</title>

Abstract: Entity Set Expansion (ESE) is a critical task aiming at expanding entities of the target semantic class described by seed entities. Most existing ESE methods are retrieval-based frameworks that need to extract contextual features of entities and calculate the similarity between seed entities and candidate entities. To achieve the two purposes, they iteratively traverse the corpus and the entity vocabulary, resulting in poor efficiency and scalability. Experimental results indicate that the time consumed by the retrieval-based ESE methods increases linearly with entity vocabulary and corpus size. In this paper, we firstly propose Generative Entity Set Expansion (GenExpan) framework, which utilizes a generative pre-trained auto-regressive language model to accomplish ESE task. Specifically, a prefix tree is employed to guarantee the validity of entity generation, and automatically generated class names are adopted to guide the model to generate target entities. Moreover, we propose Knowledge Calibration and Generative Ranking to further bridge the gap between generic knowledge of the language model and the goal of ESE task. For efficiency, expansion time consumed by GenExpan is independent of entity vocabulary and corpus size, and GenExpan achieves an average 600% speedup compared to strong baselines. For expansion effectiveness, our framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art ESE methods.</description>

      <title>Should We Attend More or Less? Modulating Attention for Fairness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advances in natural language processing (NLP) pose both opportunities and challenges. While recent progress enables the development of high-performing models for a variety of tasks, it also poses the risk of models learning harmful biases from the data, such as gender stereotypes. In this work, we investigate the role of attention, a widely-used technique in current state-of-the-art NLP models, in the propagation of social biases. Specifically, we study the relationship between the entropy of the attention distribution and the model's performance and fairness. We then propose a novel method for modulating attention weights to improve model fairness after training. Since our method is only applied post-training and pre-inference, it is an intra-processing method and is, therefore, less computationally expensive than existing in-processing and pre-processing approaches. Our results show an increase in fairness and minimal performance loss on different text classification and generation tasks using language models of varying sizes.

      <title>Generative User-Experience Research for Developing Domain-specific Natural Language Processing Applications</title>

Abstract: User experience (UX) is a part of human-computer interaction (HCI) research and focuses on increasing intuitiveness, transparency, simplicity, and trust for the system users. Most UX research for machine learning (ML) or natural language processing (NLP) focuses on a data-driven methodology. It engages domain users mainly for usability evaluation. Moreover, more typical UX methods tailor the systems towards user usability, unlike learning about the user needs first. This paper proposes a new methodology for integrating generative UX research into developing domain NLP applications. Generative UX research employs domain users at the initial stages of prototype development, i.e., ideation and concept evaluation, and the last stage for evaluating system usefulness and user utility. The methodology emerged from and is evaluated on a case study about the full-cycle prototype development of a domain-specific semantic search for daily operations in the process industry. A key finding of our case study is that involving domain experts increases their interest and trust in the final NLP application. The combined UX+NLP research of the proposed method efficiently considers data- and user-driven opportunities and constraints, which can be crucial for developing NLP applications.</description>

      <title>Open Sesame! Universal Black Box Jailbreaking of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01446v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), designed to provide helpful and safe responses, often rely on alignment techniques to align with user intent and social guidelines. Unfortunately, this alignment can be exploited by malicious actors seeking to manipulate an LLM's outputs for unintended purposes. In this paper we introduce a novel approach that employs a genetic algorithm (GA) to manipulate LLMs when model architecture and parameters are inaccessible. The GA attack works by optimizing a universal adversarial prompt that -- when combined with a user's query -- disrupts the attacked model's alignment, resulting in unintended and potentially harmful outputs. Our novel approach systematically reveals a model's limitations and vulnerabilities by uncovering instances where its responses deviate from expected behavior. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique, thus contributing to the ongoing discussion on responsible AI development by providing a diagnostic tool for evaluating and enhancing alignment of LLMs with human intent. To our knowledge this is the first automated universal black box jailbreak attack.</description>

      <title>Affect Recognition in Conversations Using Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affect recognition, encompassing emotions, moods, and feelings, plays a pivotal role in human communication. In the realm of conversational artificial intelligence, the ability to discern and respond to human affective cues is a critical factor for creating engaging and empathetic interactions. This study investigates the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to recognise human affect in conversations, with a focus on both open-domain chit-chat dialogues and task-oriented dialogues. Leveraging three diverse datasets, namely IEMOCAP (Busso et al., 2008), EmoWOZ (Feng et al., 2022), and DAIC-WOZ (Gratch et al., 2014), covering a spectrum of dialogues from casual conversations to clinical interviews, we evaluate and compare LLMs' performance in affect recognition. Our investigation explores the zero-shot and few-shot capabilities of LLMs through in-context learning as well as their model capacities through task-specific fine-tuning. Additionally, this study takes into account the potential impact of automatic speech recognition errors on LLM predictions. With this work, we aim to shed light on the extent to which LLMs can replicate human-like affect recognition capabilities in conversations.</description>

      <title>KERMIT: Knowledge Graph Completion of Enhanced Relation Modeling with Inverse Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) revolves around populating missing triples in a knowledge graph using available information. Text-based methods, which depend on textual descriptions of triples, often encounter difficulties when these descriptions lack sufficient information for accurate prediction-an issue inherent to the datasets and not easily resolved through modeling alone. To address this and ensure data consistency, we first use large language models (LLMs) to generate coherent descriptions, bridging the semantic gap between queries and answers. Secondly, we utilize inverse relations to create a symmetric graph, thereby providing augmented training samples for KGC. Additionally, we employ the label information inherent in knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance the existing contrastive framework, making it fully supervised. These efforts have led to significant performance improvements on the WN18RR and FB15k-237 datasets. According to standard evaluation metrics, our approach achieves a 4.2% improvement in Hit@1 on WN18RR and a 3.4% improvement in Hit@3 on FB15k-237, demonstrating superior performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chatbots have become popular in educational settings, revolutionizing how students interact with material and how teachers teach. We present Curriculum-Driven EduBot, a framework for developing a chatbot that combines the interactive features of chatbots with the systematic material of English textbooks to assist students in enhancing their conversational skills. We begin by extracting pertinent topics from textbooks and using large language models to generate dialogues related to these topics. We then fine-tune an open-source model using our generated conversational data to create our curriculum-driven chatbot. User studies demonstrate that EduBot outperforms ChatGPT in leading curriculum-based dialogues and adapting its dialogue to match the user's English proficiency level. By combining traditional textbook methodologies with conversational AI, our approach offers learners an interactive tool that aligns with their curriculum and provides user-tailored conversation practice. This facilitates meaningful student-bot dialogues and enriches the overall learning experience within the curriculum's pedagogical framework.</description>

      <title>LLM Lies: Hallucinations are not Bugs, but Features as Adversarial Examples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-3.5, LLaMA, and PaLM, seem to be knowledgeable and able to adapt to many tasks. However, we still cannot completely trust their answers, since LLMs suffer from \textbf{hallucination}\textemdash fabricating non-existent facts, deceiving users with or without their awareness. However, the reasons for their existence and pervasiveness remain unclear. In this paper, we demonstrate that nonsensical prompts composed of random tokens can also elicit the LLMs to respond with hallucinations. Moreover, we provide both theoretical and experimental evidence that transformers can be manipulated to produce specific pre-define tokens by perturbing its input sequence. This phenomenon forces us to revisit that \emph{hallucination may be another view of adversarial examples}, and it shares similar characteristics with conventional adversarial examples as a basic property of LLMs. Therefore, we formalize an automatic hallucination triggering method as the \textit{hallucination attack} in an adversarial way. Finally, we explore the basic properties of attacked adversarial prompts and propose a simple yet effective defense strategy. Our code is released on GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Hallucination-Attack}.</description>

      <title>Reliable Academic Conference Question Answering: A Study Based on Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the development of academic conferences fosters global scholarly communication, researchers consistently need to obtain accurate and up-to-date information about academic conferences. Since the information is scattered, using an intelligent question-answering system to efficiently handle researchers' queries and ensure awareness of the latest advancements is necessary. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in question answering, and have been enhanced by retrieving external knowledge to deal with outdated knowledge. However, these methods fail to work due to the lack of the latest conference knowledge. To address this challenge, we develop the ConferenceQA dataset, consisting of seven diverse academic conferences. Specifically, for each conference, we first organize academic conference data in a tree-structured format through a semi-automated method. Then we annotate question-answer pairs and classify the pairs into four different types to better distinguish their difficulty. With the constructed dataset, we further propose a novel method STAR (STructure-Aware Retrieval) to improve the question-answering abilities of LLMs, leveraging inherent structural information during the retrieval process. Experimental results on the ConferenceQA dataset show the effectiveness of our retrieval method. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zjukg/ConferenceQA.</description>

      <title>Multistage Collaborative Knowledge Distillation from a Large Language Model for Semi-Supervised Sequence Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08640v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study semi-supervised sequence generation tasks, where the few labeled examples are too scarce to finetune a model, and meanwhile, few-shot prompted large language models (LLMs) exhibit room for improvement. In this paper, we present the discovery that a student model distilled from a few-shot prompted LLM can commonly generalize better than its teacher to unseen examples on such tasks. We find that the student is able to learn a general pattern from the high-quality pseudolabels produced by the teacher during knowledge distillation (KD), and favorably not a general pattern from the low-quality pseudolables. Leveraging this discovery, we propose a new method, Multistage Collaborative Knowledge Distillation from an LLM (MCKD), for these tasks. MCKD first few-shot prompts an LLM to produce pseudolabels for unlabeled data. Then at each stage of an iterative KD process, a new pair of students is trained on disjoint partitions of the pseudolabeled data, and produces new and improved pseudolabels for their unseen partitions. We conduct extensive experiments on four syntactic and semantic parsing datasets and show the effectiveness of MCKD for low-resource semi-supervised sequence generation. On CRAFT biomedical parsing, for example, 3-stage MCKD with 50 labeled examples outperforms an LLM teacher and vanilla KD by 7.5% and 3.7% parsing F1, respectively, and matches the performance of supervised finetuning with 500 labeled examples.</description>

      <title>Where Do People Tell Stories Online? Story Detection Across Online Communities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Story detection in online communities is a challenging task as stories are scattered across communities and interwoven with non-storytelling spans within a single text. We address this challenge by building and releasing the StorySeeker toolkit, including a richly annotated dataset of 502 Reddit posts and comments, a detailed codebook adapted to the social media context, and models to predict storytelling at the document and span levels. Our dataset is sampled from hundreds of popular English-language Reddit communities ranging across 33 topic categories, and it contains fine-grained expert annotations, including binary story labels, story spans, and event spans. We evaluate a range of detection methods using our data, and we identify the distinctive textual features of online storytelling, focusing on storytelling spans. We illuminate distributional characteristics of storytelling on a large community-centric social media platform, and we also conduct a case study on r/ChangeMyView, where storytelling is used as one of many persuasive strategies, illustrating that our data and models can be used for both inter- and intra-community research. Finally, we discuss implications of our tools and analyses for narratology and the study of online communities.</description>

      <title>PEneo: Unifying Line Extraction, Line Grouping, and Entity Linking for End-to-end Document Pair Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Document pair extraction aims to identify key and value entities as well as their relationships from visually-rich documents. Most existing methods divide it into two separate tasks: semantic entity recognition (SER) and relation extraction (RE). However, simply concatenating SER and RE serially can lead to severe error propagation, and it fails to handle cases like multi-line entities in real scenarios. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel framework, PEneo (Pair Extraction new decoder option), which performs document pair extraction in a unified pipeline, incorporating three concurrent sub-tasks: line extraction, line grouping, and entity linking. This approach alleviates the error accumulation problem and can handle the case of multi-line entities. Furthermore, to better evaluate the model's performance and to facilitate future research on pair extraction, we introduce RFUND, a re-annotated version of the commonly used FUNSD and XFUND datasets, to make them more accurate and cover realistic situations. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate PEneo's superiority over previous pipelines, boosting the performance by a large margin (e.g., 19.89%-22.91% F1 score on RFUND-EN) when combined with various backbones like LiLT and LayoutLMv3, showing its effectiveness and generality. Codes and the new annotations are available at \href{https://github.com/ZeningLin/PEneo}{https://github.com/ZeningLin/PEneo}.</description>

      <title>Integrating Physician Diagnostic Logic into Large Language Models: Preference Learning from Process Feedback</title>

Abstract: The use of large language models in medical dialogue generation has garnered significant attention, with a focus on improving response quality and fluency. While previous studies have made progress in optimizing model performance for single-round medical Q&amp;A tasks, there is a need to enhance the model's capability for multi-round conversations to avoid logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose an approach called preference learning from process feedback~(PLPF), which integrates the doctor's diagnostic logic into LLMs. PLPF involves rule modeling, preference data generation, and preference alignment to train the model to adhere to the diagnostic process. Experimental results using Standardized Patient Testing show that PLPF enhances the diagnostic accuracy of the baseline model in medical conversations by 17.6%, outperforming traditional reinforcement learning from human feedback. Additionally, PLPF demonstrates effectiveness in both multi-round and single-round dialogue tasks, showcasing its potential for improving medical dialogue generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chomsky and others have very directly claimed that large language models (LLMs) are equally capable of learning languages that are possible and impossible for humans to learn. However, there is very little published experimental evidence to support such a claim. Here, we develop a set of synthetic impossible languages of differing complexity, each designed by systematically altering English data with unnatural word orders and grammar rules. These languages lie on an impossibility continuum: at one end are languages that are inherently impossible, such as random and irreversible shuffles of English words, and on the other, languages that may not be intuitively impossible but are often considered so in linguistics, particularly those with rules based on counting word positions. We report on a wide range of evaluations to assess the capacity of GPT-2 small models to learn these uncontroversially impossible languages, and crucially, we perform these assessments at various stages throughout training to compare the learning process for each language. Our core finding is that GPT-2 struggles to learn impossible languages when compared to English as a control, challenging the core claim. More importantly, we hope our approach opens up a productive line of inquiry in which different LLM architectures are tested on a variety of impossible languages in an effort to learn more about how LLMs can be used as tools for these cognitive and typological investigations.</description>

      <title>AttackEval: How to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Jailbreak Attacking on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09002v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring the security of large language models (LLMs) against attacks has become increasingly urgent, with jailbreak attacks representing one of the most sophisticated threats. To deal with such risks, we introduce an innovative framework that can help evaluate the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks on LLMs. Unlike traditional binary evaluations focusing solely on the robustness of LLMs, our method assesses the effectiveness of the attacking prompts themselves. We present two distinct evaluation frameworks: a coarse-grained evaluation and a fine-grained evaluation. Each framework uses a scoring range from 0 to 1, offering unique perspectives and allowing for the assessment of attack effectiveness in different scenarios. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive ground truth dataset specifically tailored for jailbreak prompts. This dataset serves as a crucial benchmark for our current study and provides a foundational resource for future research. By comparing with traditional evaluation methods, our study shows that the current results align with baseline metrics while offering a more nuanced and fine-grained assessment. It also helps identify potentially harmful attack prompts that might appear harmless in traditional evaluations. Overall, our work establishes a solid foundation for assessing a broader range of attack prompts in the area of prompt injection.</description>

      <title>eCeLLM: Generalizing Large Language Models for E-commerce from Large-scale, High-quality Instruction Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With tremendous efforts on developing effective e-commerce models, conventional e-commerce models show limited success in generalist e-commerce modeling, and suffer from unsatisfactory performance on new users and new products - a typical out-of-domain generalization challenge. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate outstanding performance in generalist modeling and out-of-domain generalizability in many fields. Toward fully unleashing their power for e-commerce, in this paper, we construct ECInstruct, the first open-sourced, large-scale, and high-quality benchmark instruction dataset for e-commerce. Leveraging ECInstruct, we develop eCeLLM, a series of e-commerce LLMs, by instruction-tuning general-purpose LLMs. Our comprehensive experiments and evaluation demonstrate that eCeLLM models substantially outperform baseline models, including the most advanced GPT-4, and the state-of-the-art task-specific models in in-domain evaluation. Moreover, eCeLLM exhibits excellent generalizability to out-of-domain settings, including unseen products and unseen instructions, highlighting its superiority as a generalist e-commerce model. Both the ECInstruct dataset and the eCeLLM models show great potential in empowering versatile and effective LLMs for e-commerce. ECInstruct and eCeLLM models are publicly accessible through https://ninglab.github.io/eCeLLM.</description>

      <title>A Chinese Dataset for Evaluating the Safeguards in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many studies have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can produce harmful responses, exposing users to unexpected risks when LLMs are deployed. Previous studies have proposed comprehensive taxonomies of the risks posed by LLMs, as well as corresponding prompts that can be used to examine the safety mechanisms of LLMs. However, the focus has been almost exclusively on English, and little has been explored for other languages. Here we aim to bridge this gap. We first introduce a dataset for the safety evaluation of Chinese LLMs, and then extend it to two other scenarios that can be used to better identify false negative and false positive examples in terms of risky prompt rejections. We further present a set of fine-grained safety assessment criteria for each risk type, facilitating both manual annotation and automatic evaluation in terms of LLM response harmfulness. Our experiments on five LLMs show that region-specific risks are the prevalent type of risk, presenting the major issue with all Chinese LLMs we experimented with. Our data is available at https://github.com/Libr-AI/do-not-answer. Warning: this paper contains example data that may be offensive, harmful, or biased.</description>

      <title>Zero shot VLMs for hate meme detection: Are we there yet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimedia content on social media is rapidly evolving, with memes gaining prominence as a distinctive form. Unfortunately, some malicious users exploit memes to target individuals or vulnerable communities, making it imperative to identify and address such instances of hateful memes. Extensive research has been conducted to address this issue by developing hate meme detection models. However, a notable limitation of traditional machine/deep learning models is the requirement for labeled datasets for accurate classification. Recently, the research community has witnessed the emergence of several visual language models that have exhibited outstanding performance across various tasks. In this study, we aim to investigate the efficacy of these visual language models in handling intricate tasks such as hate meme detection. We use various prompt settings to focus on zero-shot classification of hateful/harmful memes. Through our analysis, we observe that large VLMs are still vulnerable for zero-shot hate meme detection.</description>

      <title>What if LLMs Have Different World Views: Simulating Alien Civilizations with LLM-based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce "CosmoAgent," an innovative artificial intelligence framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate complex interactions between human and extraterrestrial civilizations, with a special emphasis on Stephen Hawking's cautionary advice about not sending radio signals haphazardly into the universe. The goal is to assess the feasibility of peaceful coexistence while considering potential risks that could threaten well-intentioned civilizations. Employing mathematical models and state transition matrices, our approach quantitatively evaluates the development trajectories of civilizations, offering insights into future decision-making at critical points of growth and saturation. Furthermore, the paper acknowledges the vast diversity in potential living conditions across the universe, which could foster unique cosmologies, ethical codes, and worldviews among various civilizations. Recognizing the Earth-centric bias inherent in current LLM designs, we propose the novel concept of using LLMs with diverse ethical paradigms and simulating interactions between entities with distinct moral principles. This innovative research provides a new way to understand complex inter-civilizational dynamics, expanding our perspective while pioneering novel strategies for conflict resolution, which are crucial for preventing interstellar conflicts. We have also released the code and datasets to enable further academic investigation into this interesting area of research. The code is available at https://github.com/MingyuJ666/Simulating-Alien-Civilizations-with-LLM-based-Agents.</description>

      <title>Where Do We Go from Here? Multi-scale Allocentric Relational Inference from Natural Spatial Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When communicating routes in natural language, the concept of acquired spatial knowledge is crucial for geographic information retrieval (GIR) and in spatial cognitive research. However, NLP navigation studies often overlook the impact of such acquired knowledge on textual descriptions. Current navigation studies concentrate on egocentric local descriptions (e.g., `it will be on your right') that require reasoning over the agent's local perception. These instructions are typically given as a sequence of steps, with each action-step explicitly mentioning and being followed by a landmark that the agent can use to verify they are on the right path (e.g., `turn right and then you will see...'). In contrast, descriptions based on knowledge acquired through a map provide a complete view of the environment and capture its overall structure. These instructions (e.g., `it is south of Central Park and a block north of a police station') are typically non-sequential, contain allocentric relations, with multiple spatial relations and implicit actions, without any explicit verification. This paper introduces the Rendezvous (RVS) task and dataset, which includes 10,404 examples of English geospatial instructions for reaching a target location using map-knowledge. Our analysis reveals that RVS exhibits a richer use of spatial allocentric relations, and requires resolving more spatial relations simultaneously compared to previous text-based navigation benchmarks.</description>

      <title>InjecAgent: Benchmarking Indirect Prompt Injections in Tool-Integrated Large Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02691v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has embodied LLMs as agents, allowing them to access tools, perform actions, and interact with external content (e.g., emails or websites). However, external content introduces the risk of indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks, where malicious instructions are embedded within the content processed by LLMs, aiming to manipulate these agents into executing detrimental actions against users. Given the potentially severe consequences of such attacks, establishing benchmarks to assess and mitigate these risks is imperative.
  In this work, we introduce InjecAgent, a benchmark designed to assess the vulnerability of tool-integrated LLM agents to IPI attacks. InjecAgent comprises 1,054 test cases covering 17 different user tools and 62 attacker tools. We categorize attack intentions into two primary types: direct harm to users and exfiltration of private data. We evaluate 30 different LLM agents and show that agents are vulnerable to IPI attacks, with ReAct-prompted GPT-4 vulnerable to attacks 24% of the time. Further investigation into an enhanced setting, where the attacker instructions are reinforced with a hacking prompt, shows additional increases in success rates, nearly doubling the attack success rate on the ReAct-prompted GPT-4. Our findings raise questions about the widespread deployment of LLM Agents. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/InjecAgent.</description>

      <title>Instruction Multi-Constraint Molecular Generation Using a Teacher-Student Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While various models and computational tools have been proposed for structure and property analysis of molecules, generating molecules that conform to all desired structures and properties remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a multi-constraint molecular generation large language model, TSMMG, which, akin to a student, incorporates knowledge from various small models and tools, namely, the 'teachers'. To train TSMMG, we construct a large set of text-molecule pairs by extracting molecular knowledge from these 'teachers', enabling it to generate novel molecules that conform to the descriptions through various text prompts. We experimentally show that TSMMG remarkably performs in generating molecules meeting complex, natural language-described property requirements across two-, three-, and four-constraint tasks, with an average molecular validity of over 99% and success ratio of 82.58%, 68.03%, and 67.48%, respectively. The model also exhibits adaptability through zero-shot testing, creating molecules that satisfy combinations of properties that have not been encountered. It can comprehend text inputs with various language styles, extending beyond the confines of outlined prompts, as confirmed through empirical validation. Additionally, the knowledge distillation feature of TSMMG contributes to the continuous enhancement of small models, while the innovative approach to dataset construction effectively addresses the issues of data scarcity and quality, which positions TSMMG as a promising tool in the domains of drug discovery and materials science.</description>

      <title>SocialBench: Sociality Evaluation of Role-Playing Conversational Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13679v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the development of various AI conversational agents, including role-playing conversational agents that mimic diverse characters and human behaviors. While prior research has predominantly focused on enhancing the conversational capability, role-specific knowledge, and stylistic attributes of these agents, there has been a noticeable gap in assessing their social intelligence. In this paper, we introduce SocialBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the sociality of role-playing conversational agents at both individual and group levels of social interactions. The benchmark is constructed from a variety of sources and covers a wide range of 500 characters and over 6,000 question prompts and 30,800 multi-turn role-playing utterances. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on this benchmark using mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs. We find that agents excelling in individual level does not imply their proficiency in group level. Moreover, the behavior of individuals may drift as a result of the influence exerted by other agents within the group. Experimental results on SocialBench confirm its significance as a testbed for assessing the social interaction of role-playing conversational agents. The benchmark is publicly accessible at https://github.com/X-PLUG/SocialBench.</description>

Abstract: Biomedical queries have become increasingly prevalent in web searches, reflecting the growing interest in accessing biomedical literature. Despite recent research on large-language models (LLMs) motivated by endeavours to attain generalized intelligence, their efficacy in replacing task and domain-specific natural language understanding approaches remains questionable. In this paper, we address this question by conducting a comprehensive empirical evaluation of intent detection and named entity recognition (NER) tasks from biomedical text. We show that Supervised Fine Tuned approaches are still relevant and more effective than general-purpose LLMs. Biomedical transformer models such as PubMedBERT can surpass ChatGPT on NER task with only 5 supervised examples.</description>

      <title>Locating and Editing Factual Associations in Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms of factual recall in the Mamba state space model. Our work is inspired by previous findings in autoregressive transformer language models suggesting that their knowledge recall is localized to particular modules at specific token locations; we therefore ask whether factual recall in Mamba can be similarly localized. To investigate this, we conduct four lines of experiments on Mamba. First, we apply causal tracing or interchange interventions to localize key components inside Mamba that are responsible for recalling facts, revealing that specific components within middle layers show strong causal effects at the last token of the subject, while the causal effect of intervening on later layers is most pronounced at the last token of the prompt, matching previous findings on autoregressive transformers. Second, we show that rank-one model editing methods can successfully insert facts at specific locations, again resembling findings on transformer LMs. Third, we examine the linearity of Mamba's representations of factual relations. Finally we adapt attention-knockout techniques to Mamba in order to dissect information flow during factual recall. We compare Mamba directly to a similar-sized autoregressive transformer LM and conclude that despite significant differences in architectural approach, when it comes to factual recall, the two architectures share many similarities.</description>

      <title>Using Letter Positional Probabilities to Assess Word Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07768v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Word complexity is defined in a number of different ways. Psycholinguistic, morphological and lexical proxies are often used. Human ratings are also used. The problem here is that these proxies do not measure complexity directly, and human ratings are susceptible to subjective bias. In this study we contend that some form of 'latent complexity' can be approximated by using samples of simple and complex words. We use a sample of 'simple' words from primary school picture books and a sample of 'complex' words from high school and academic settings. In order to analyse the differences between these classes, we look at the letter positional probabilities (LPPs). We find strong statistical associations between several LPPs and complexity. For example, simple words are significantly (p&lt;.001) more likely to start with w, b, s, h, g, k, j, t, y or f, while complex words are significantly (p&lt;.001) more likely to start with i, a, e, r, v, u or d. We find similar strong associations for subsequent letter positions, with 84 letter-position variables in the first 6 positions being significant at the p&lt;.001 level. We then use LPPs as variables in creating a classifier which can classify the two classes with an 83% accuracy. We test these findings using a second data set, with 66 LPPs significant (p&lt;.001) in the first 6 positions common to both datasets. We use these 66 variables to create a classifier that is able to classify a third dataset with an accuracy of 70%. Finally, we create a fourth sample by combining the extreme high and low scoring words generated by three classifiers built on the first three separate datasets and use this sample to build a classifier which has an accuracy of 97%. We use this to score the four levels of English word groups from an ESL program.</description>

      <title>TriForce: Lossless Acceleration of Long Sequence Generation with Hierarchical Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With large language models (LLMs) widely deployed in long content generation recently, there has emerged an increasing demand for efficient long-sequence inference support. However, key-value (KV) cache, which is stored to avoid re-computation, has emerged as a critical bottleneck by growing linearly in size with the sequence length. Due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, the entire KV cache will be loaded for every generated token, resulting in low utilization of computational cores and high latency. While various compression methods for KV cache have been proposed to alleviate this issue, they suffer from degradation in generation quality. We introduce TriForce, a hierarchical speculative decoding system that is scalable for long sequence generation. This approach leverages the original model weights and dynamic sparse KV cache via retrieval as a draft model, which serves as an intermediate layer in the hierarchy and is further speculated by a smaller model to reduce its drafting latency. TriForce not only facilitates impressive speedups for Llama2-7B-128K, achieving up to 2.31$\times$ on an A100 GPU but also showcases scalability in handling even longer contexts. For the offloading setting on two RTX 4090 GPUs, TriForce achieves 0.108s/token$\unicode{x2014}$only half as slow as the auto-regressive baseline on an A100, which attains 7.78$\times$ on our optimized offloading system. Additionally, TriForce performs 4.86$\times$ than DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference on a single RTX 4090 GPU. TriForce's robustness is highlighted by its consistently outstanding performance across various temperatures. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/TriForce.</description>

      <title>WorkBench: a Benchmark Dataset for Agents in a Realistic Workplace Setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce WorkBench: a benchmark dataset for evaluating agents' ability to execute tasks in a workplace setting. WorkBench contains a sandbox environment with five databases, 26 tools, and 690 tasks. These tasks represent common business activities, such as sending emails and scheduling meetings. The tasks in WorkBench are challenging as they require planning, tool selection, and often multiple actions. If a task has been successfully executed, one (or more) of the database values may change. The correct outcome for each task is unique and unambiguous, which allows for robust, automated evaluation. We call this key contribution outcome-centric evaluation. We evaluate five existing ReAct agents on WorkBench, finding they successfully complete as few as 3% of tasks (Llama2-70B), and just 43% for the best-performing (GPT-4). We further find that agents' errors can result in the wrong action being taken, such as an email being sent to the wrong person. WorkBench reveals weaknesses in agents' ability to undertake common business activities, raising questions about their use in high-stakes workplace settings. WorkBench is publicly available as a free resource at https://github.com/olly-styles/WorkBench.</description>

      <title>The Multi-Range Theory of Translation Quality Measurement: MQM scoring models and Statistical Quality Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16969v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The year 2024 marks the 10th anniversary of the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework for analytic translation quality evaluation. The MQM error typology has been widely used by practitioners in the translation and localization industry and has served as the basis for many derivative projects. The annual Conference on Machine Translation (WMT) shared tasks on both human and automatic translation quality evaluations used the MQM error typology.
  The metric stands on two pillars: error typology and the scoring model. The scoring model calculates the quality score from annotation data, detailing how to convert error type and severity counts into numeric scores to determine if the content meets specifications. Previously, only the raw scoring model had been published. This April, the MQM Council published the Linear Calibrated Scoring Model, officially presented herein, along with the Non-Linear Scoring Model, which had not been published before.
  This paper details the latest MQM developments and presents a universal approach to translation quality measurement across three sample size ranges. It also explains why Statistical Quality Control should be used for very small sample sizes, starting from a single sentence.</description>

      <title>WRDScore: New Metric for Evaluation of Natural Language Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19220v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating natural language generation models, particularly for method name prediction, poses significant challenges. A robust metric must account for the versatility of method naming, considering both semantic and syntactic variations. Traditional overlap-based metrics fail to capture these nuances. Existing embedding-based metrics often suffer from imbalanced precision and recall, lack normalized scores, or make unrealistic assumptions about sequences. To address these limitations, we propose WRDScore, a novel metric that strikes a balance between simplicity and effectiveness. Our metric is lightweight, normalized, and precision-recall-oriented, avoiding unrealistic assumptions while aligning well with human judgments.</description>

      <title>What Do Language Models Learn in Context? The Structured Task Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit an intriguing ability to learn a novel task from in-context examples presented in a demonstration, termed in-context learning (ICL). Understandably, a swath of research has been dedicated to uncovering the theories underpinning ICL. One popular hypothesis explains ICL by task selection. LLMs identify the task based on the demonstration and generalize it to the prompt. Another popular hypothesis is that ICL is a form of meta-learning, i.e., the models learn a learning algorithm at pre-training time and apply it to the demonstration. Finally, a third hypothesis argues that LLMs use the demonstration to select a composition of tasks learned during pre-training to perform ICL. In this paper, we empirically explore these three hypotheses that explain LLMs' ability to learn in context with a suite of experiments derived from common text classification tasks. We invalidate the first two hypotheses with counterexamples and provide evidence in support of the last hypothesis. Our results suggest an LLM could learn a novel task in context via composing tasks learned during pre-training.</description>

      <title>Should We Fine-Tune or RAG? Evaluating Different Techniques to Adapt LLMs for Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the task of response generation in human-machine dialogue. Several techniques have been proposed in the literature for different dialogue types (e.g., Open-Domain). However, the evaluations of these techniques have been limited in terms of base LLMs, dialogue types and evaluation metrics. In this work, we extensively analyze different LLM adaptation techniques when applied to different dialogue types. We have selected two base LLMs, Llama-2 and Mistral, and four dialogue types Open-Domain, Knowledge-Grounded, Task-Oriented, and Question Answering. We evaluate the performance of in-context learning and fine-tuning techniques across datasets selected for each dialogue type. We assess the impact of incorporating external knowledge to ground the generation in both scenarios of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and gold knowledge. We adopt consistent evaluation and explainability criteria for automatic metrics and human evaluation protocols. Our analysis shows that there is no universal best-technique for adapting large language models as the efficacy of each technique depends on both the base LLM and the specific type of dialogue. Last but not least, the assessment of the best adaptation technique should include human evaluation to avoid false expectations and outcomes derived from automatic metrics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce BSRBF-KAN, a Kolmogorov Arnold Network (KAN) that combines Bsplines and radial basis functions (RBFs) to fit input vectors in data training. We perform experiments with BSRBF-KAN, MLP, and other popular KANs, including EfficientKAN, FastKAN, FasterKAN, and GottliebKAN over the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. BSRBF-KAN shows stability in 5 training sessions with a competitive average accuracy of 97.55% on MNIST and 89.33% on FashionMNIST and obtains convergence better than other networks. We expect BSRBF-KAN to open many combinations of mathematical functions to design KANs. Our repo is publicly available at: https://github.com/hoangthangta/BSRBF-KAN.</description>

      <title>InterCLIP-MEP: Interactive CLIP and Memory-Enhanced Predictor for Multi-modal Sarcasm Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prevalence of sarcasm in social media, conveyed through text-image combinations, presents significant challenges for sentiment analysis and intention mining. Existing multi-modal sarcasm detection methods have been proven to overestimate performance, as they struggle to effectively capture the intricate sarcastic cues that arise from the interaction between an image and text. To address these issues, we propose InterCLIP-MEP, a novel framework for multi-modal sarcasm detection. Specifically, we introduce an Interactive CLIP (InterCLIP) as the backbone to extract text-image representations, enhancing them by embedding cross-modality information directly within each encoder, thereby improving the representations to capture text-image interactions better. Furthermore, an efficient training strategy is designed to adapt InterCLIP for our proposed Memory-Enhanced Predictor (MEP). MEP uses a dynamic, fixed-length dual-channel memory to store historical knowledge of valuable test samples during inference. It then leverages this memory as a non-parametric classifier to derive the final prediction, offering a more robust recognition of multi-modal sarcasm. Experiments demonstrate that InterCLIP-MEP achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MMSD2.0 benchmark, with an accuracy improvement of 1.08% and an F1 score improvement of 1.51% over the previous best method. Code and data are available at https://github.com/CoderChen01/InterCLIP-MEP.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Commentary Strategies for Imperfect Information Card Games: A Study of Large Language Models in Guandan Commentary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked the potential for generating high-quality game commentary. However, producing insightful and engaging commentary for complex games with incomplete information remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel commentary method that combine Reinforcement Learning (RL) and LLMs, tailored specifically for the Chinese card game \textit{Guandan}. Our system leverages RL to generate intricate card-playing scenarios and employs LLMs to generate corresponding commentary text, effectively emulating the strategic analysis and narrative prowess of professional commentators. The framework comprises a state commentary guide, a Theory of Mind (ToM)-based strategy analyzer, and a style retrieval module, which seamlessly collaborate to deliver detailed and context-relevant game commentary in the Chinese language environment. We empower LLMs with ToM capabilities and refine both retrieval and information filtering mechanisms. This facilitates the generation of personalized commentary content. Our experimental results showcase the substantial enhancement in performance achieved by the proposed commentary framework when applied to open-source LLMs, surpassing the performance of GPT-4 across multiple evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Faux Polyglot: A Study on Information Disparity in Multilingual Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing a pivotal role in information search and are being adopted globally. Although the multilingual capability of LLMs offers new opportunities to bridge the language barrier, do these capabilities translate into real-life scenarios where linguistic divide and knowledge conflicts between multilingual sources are known occurrences? In this paper, we studied LLM's linguistic preference in a RAG-based information search setting. We found that LLMs displayed systemic bias towards information in the same language as the query language in both information retrieval and answer generation. Furthermore, in scenarios where there is little information in the language of the query, LLMs prefer documents in high-resource languages, reinforcing the dominant views. Such bias exists for both factual and opinion-based queries. Our results highlight the linguistic divide within multilingual LLMs in information search systems. The seemingly beneficial multilingual capability of LLMs may backfire on information parity by reinforcing language-specific information cocoons or filter bubbles further marginalizing low-resource views.</description>

      <title>Automata-based constraints for language model decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) are often expected to generate strings in some formal language; for example, structured data, API calls, or code snippets. Although LMs can be tuned to improve their adherence to formal syntax, this does not guarantee conformance, especially with smaller LMs suitable for large-scale deployment. In addition, tuning requires significant resources, making it impractical for uncommon or task-specific formats. To prevent downstream parsing errors we would ideally constrain the LM to only produce valid output, but this is severely complicated by tokenization, which is typically both ambiguous and misaligned with the formal grammar. We solve these issues through the application of automata theory, deriving an efficient closed-form solution for the regular languages, a broad class of formal languages with many practical applications, including API calls or schema-guided JSON and YAML. We also discuss pragmatic extensions for coping with the issue of high branching factor, and extend our techniques to deterministic context-free languages, which similarly admit an efficient closed-form solution. Previous work on this topic (Willard and Louf, 2023) layers bespoke solutions onto automata, leading to problems with speed, correctness, and extensibility. Instead, we reformulate the entire task in terms of automata so we can leverage well-studied and well-optimized algorithms. Our system compiles constraints ~7,000x faster, is provably correct, and can be extended in a modular fashion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their nearly universal adoption for large language models, the internal workings of transformers are not well understood. We aim to better understand the impact of removing or reorganizing information throughout the layers of a pretrained transformer. Such an understanding could both yield better usage of existing models as well as to make architectural improvements to produce new variants. We present a series of empirical studies on frozen models that show that the lower and final layers of pretrained transformers differ from middle layers, but that middle layers have a surprising amount of uniformity. We further show that some classes of problems have robustness to skipping layers, running the layers in an order different from how they were trained, or running the layers in parallel. Our observations suggest that even frozen pretrained models may gracefully trade accuracy for latency by skipping layers or running layers in parallel.</description>

      <title>Think-on-Graph 2.0: Deep and Interpretable Large Language Model Reasoning with Knowledge Graph-guided Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large language models (LLMs) by enabling dynamic information retrieval to mitigate knowledge gaps and hallucinations in generated content. However, these systems often falter with complex reasoning and consistency across diverse queries. In this work, we present Think-on-Graph 2.0, an enhanced RAG framework that aligns questions with the knowledge graph and uses it as a navigational tool, which deepens and refines the RAG paradigm for information collection and integration. The KG-guided navigation fosters deep and long-range associations to uphold logical consistency and optimize the scope of retrieval for precision and interoperability. In conjunction, factual consistency can be better ensured through semantic similarity guided by precise directives. ToG${2.0}$ not only improves the accuracy and reliability of LLMs' responses but also demonstrates the potential of hybrid structured knowledge systems to significantly advance LLM reasoning, aligning it closer to human-like performance. We conducted extensive experiments on four public datasets to demonstrate the advantages of our method compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Polysemy Evolution using Semantic Cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The senses of words evolve. The sense of the same word may change from today to tomorrow, and multiple senses of the same word may be the result of the evolution of each other, that is, they may be parents and children. If we view Juba as an evolving ecosystem, the paradigm of learning the correct answer, which does not move with the sense of a word, is no longer valid. This paper is a case study that shows that word polysemy is an evolutionary consequence of the modification of Semantic Cells, which has al-ready been presented by the author, by introducing a small amount of diversity in its initial state as an example of analyzing the current set of short sentences. In particular, the analysis of a sentence sequence of 1000 sentences in some order for each of the four senses of the word Spring, collected using Chat GPT, shows that the word acquires the most polysemy monotonically in the analysis when the senses are arranged in the order in which they have evolved. In other words, we present a method for analyzing the dynamism of a word's acquiring polysemy with evolution and, at the same time, a methodology for viewing polysemy from an evolutionary framework rather than a learning-based one.</description>

      <title>LawLuo: A Chinese Law Firm Co-run by LLM Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial potential in delivering legal consultation services to users without a legal background, attributed to their superior text comprehension and generation capabilities. Nonetheless, existing Chinese legal LLMs limit interaction to a single model-user dialogue, unlike the collaborative consultations typical of law firms, where multiple staff members contribute to a single consultation. This limitation prevents an authentic consultation experience. Additionally, extant Chinese legal LLMs suffer from critical limitations: (1) insufficient control over the quality of instruction fine-tuning data; (2) increased model hallucination resulting from users' ambiguous queries; and (3) a reduction in the model's ability to follow instructions over multiple dialogue turns. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel legal dialogue framework that leverages the collaborative capabilities of multiple LLM agents, termed LawLuo. This framework encompasses four agents: a receptionist, a lawyer, a secretary, and a boss, each responsible for different functionalities, collaboratively providing a comprehensive legal consultation to users. Additionally, we constructed two high-quality legal dialogue datasets, KINLED and MURLED, and fine-tuned ChatGLM-3-6b using these datasets. We propose a legal query clarification algorithm called ToLC. Experimental results demonstrate that LawLuo outperforms baseline LLMs, including GPT-4, across three dimensions: lawyer-like language style, the usefulness of legal advice, and the accuracy of legal knowledge. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/NEFUJing/LawLuo.</description>

      <title>The Power of Combining Data and Knowledge: GPT-4o is an Effective Interpreter of Machine Learning Models in Predicting Lymph Node Metastasis of Lung Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17900v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is a crucial factor in determining the initial treatment for patients with lung cancer, yet accurate preoperative diagnosis of LNM remains challenging. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their remarkable text generation capabilities. Leveraging the extensive medical knowledge learned from vast corpora, LLMs can estimate probabilities for clinical problems, though their performance has historically been inferior to data-driven machine learning models. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble method that combines the medical knowledge acquired by LLMs with the latent patterns identified by machine learning models to enhance LNM prediction performance. Initially, we developed machine learning models using patient data. We then designed a prompt template to integrate the patient data with the predicted probability from the machine learning model. Subsequently, we instructed GPT-4o, the most advanced LLM developed by OpenAI, to estimate the likelihood of LNM based on patient data and then adjust the estimate using the machine learning output. Finally, we collected three outputs from the GPT-4o using the same prompt and ensembled these results as the final prediction. Using the proposed method, our models achieved an AUC value of 0.778 and an AP value of 0.426 for LNM prediction, significantly improving predictive performance compared to baseline machine learning models. The experimental results indicate that GPT-4o can effectively leverage its medical knowledge and the probabilities predicted by machine learning models to achieve more accurate LNM predictions. These findings demonstrate that LLMs can perform well in clinical risk prediction tasks, offering a new paradigm for integrating medical knowledge and patient data in clinical predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 1st Workshop on Data Contamination (CONDA 2024) focuses on all relevant aspects of data contamination in natural language processing, where data contamination is understood as situations where evaluation data is included in pre-training corpora used to train large scale models, compromising evaluation results. The workshop fostered a shared task to collect evidence on data contamination in current available datasets and models. The goal of the shared task and associated database is to assist the community in understanding the extent of the problem and to assist researchers in avoiding reporting evaluation results on known contaminated resources. The shared task provides a structured, centralized public database for the collection of contamination evidence, open to contributions from the community via GitHub pool requests. This first compilation paper is based on 566 reported entries over 91 contaminated sources from a total of 23 contributors. The details of the individual contamination events are available in the platform. The platform continues to be online, open to contributions from the community.</description>

Abstract: We present ShieldGemma, a comprehensive suite of LLM-based safety content moderation models built upon Gemma2. These models provide robust, state-of-the-art predictions of safety risks across key harm types (sexually explicit, dangerous content, harassment, hate speech) in both user input and LLM-generated output. By evaluating on both public and internal benchmarks, we demonstrate superior performance compared to existing models, such as Llama Guard (+10.8\% AU-PRC on public benchmarks) and WildCard (+4.3\%). Additionally, we present a novel LLM-based data curation pipeline, adaptable to a variety of safety-related tasks and beyond. We have shown strong generalization performance for model trained mainly on synthetic data. By releasing ShieldGemma, we provide a valuable resource to the research community, advancing LLM safety and enabling the creation of more effective content moderation solutions for developers.</description>

      <title>Fairness in Large Language Models in Three Hour</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various domains but often lack fairness considerations, potentially leading to discriminatory outcomes against marginalized populations. Unlike fairness in traditional machine learning, fairness in LLMs involves unique backgrounds, taxonomies, and fulfillment techniques. This tutorial provides a systematic overview of recent advances in the literature concerning fair LLMs, beginning with real-world case studies to introduce LLMs, followed by an analysis of bias causes therein. The concept of fairness in LLMs is then explored, summarizing the strategies for evaluating bias and the algorithms designed to promote fairness. Additionally, resources for assessing bias in LLMs, including toolkits and datasets, are compiled, and current research challenges and open questions in the field are discussed.

      <title>Confidence-aware Self-Semantic Distillation on Knowledge Graph Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.02963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE), which projects entities and relations into continuous vector spaces, has garnered significant attention. Although high-dimensional KGE methods offer better performance, they come at the expense of significant computation and memory overheads. Decreasing embedding dimensions significantly deteriorates model performance. While several recent efforts utilize knowledge distillation or non-Euclidean representation learning to augment the effectiveness of low-dimensional KGE, they either necessitate a pre-trained high-dimensional teacher model or involve complex non-Euclidean operations, thereby incurring considerable additional computational costs. To address this, this work proposes Confidence-aware Self-Knowledge Distillation (CSD) that learns from the model itself to enhance KGE in a low-dimensional space. Specifically, CSD extracts knowledge from embeddings in previous iterations, which would be utilized to supervise the learning of the model in the next iterations. Moreover, a specific semantic module is developed to filter reliable knowledge by estimating the confidence of previously learned embeddings. This straightforward strategy bypasses the need for time-consuming pre-training of teacher models and can be integrated into various KGE methods to improve their performance. Our comprehensive experiments on six KGE backbones and four datasets underscore the effectiveness of the proposed CSD.</description>

      <title>Vision Learners Meet Web Image-Text Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many self-supervised learning methods are pre-trained on the well-curated ImageNet-1K dataset. In this work, given the excellent scalability of web data, we consider self-supervised pre-training on noisy web sourced image-text paired data. First, we conduct a benchmark study of representative self-supervised pre-training methods on large-scale web data in a like-for-like setting. We compare a range of methods, including single-modal ones that use masked training objectives and multi-modal ones that use image-text constrastive training. We observe that existing multi-modal methods do not outperform their single-modal counterparts on vision transfer learning tasks. We derive an information-theoretical view to explain these benchmark results, which provides insight into how to design a novel vision learner. Inspired by this insight, we present a new visual representation pre-training method, MUlti-modal Generator~(MUG), that learns from scalable web sourced image-text data. MUG achieves state-of-the-art transfer performance on a variety of tasks and demonstrates promising scaling properties. Pre-trained models and code will be made public upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Context-dependent communication under environmental constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is significant evidence that real-world communication cannot be reduced to sending signals with context-independent meaning. In this work, based on a variant of the classical Lewis (1969) signaling model, we explore the conditions for the emergence of context-dependent communication in a situated scenario. In particular, we demonstrate that pressure to minimise the vocabulary size is sufficient for such emergence. At the same time, we study the environmental conditions and cognitive capabilities that enable contextual disambiguation of symbol meanings. We show that environmental constraints on the receiver's referent choice can be unilaterally exploited by the sender, without disambiguation capabilities on the receiver's end. Consistent with common assumptions, the sender's awareness of the context appears to be required for contextual communication. We suggest that context-dependent communication is a situated multilayered phenomenon, crucially influenced by environment properties such as distribution of contexts. The model developed in this work is a demonstration of how signals may be ambiguous out of context, but still allow for near-perfect communication accuracy.</description>

      <title>Emergent Representations of Program Semantics in Language Models Trained on Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11169v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present evidence that language models (LMs) of code can learn to represent the formal semantics of programs, despite being trained only to perform next-token prediction. Specifically, we train a Transformer model on a synthetic corpus of programs written in a domain-specific language for navigating 2D grid world environments. Each program in the corpus is preceded by a (partial) specification in the form of several input-output grid world states. Despite providing no further inductive biases, we find that a probing classifier is able to extract increasingly accurate representations of the unobserved, intermediate grid world states from the LM hidden states over the course of training, suggesting the LM acquires an emergent ability to interpret programs in the formal sense. We also develop a novel interventional baseline that enables us to disambiguate what is represented by the LM as opposed to learned by the probe. We anticipate that this technique may be generally applicable to a broad range of semantic probing experiments. In summary, this paper does not propose any new techniques for training LMs of code, but develops an experimental framework for and provides insights into the acquisition and representation of formal semantics in statistical models of code.

      <title>A Review on Knowledge Graphs for Healthcare: Resources, Applications, and Promises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04802v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Healthcare knowledge graphs (HKGs) are valuable tools for organizing biomedical concepts and their relationships with interpretable structures. The recent advent of large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for building more comprehensive and accurate HKGs. This, in turn, can improve the reliability of generated content and enable better evaluation of LLMs. However, the challenges of HKGs such as regarding data heterogeneity and limited coverage are not fully understood, highlighting the need for detailed reviews. This work provides the first comprehensive review of HKGs. It summarizes the pipeline and key techniques for HKG construction, as well as the common utilization approaches, i.e., model-free and model-based. The existing HKG resources are also organized based on the data types they capture and application domains they cover, along with relevant statistical information (Resource available at https://github.com/lujiaying/Awesome-HealthCare-KnowledgeBase). At the application level, we delve into the successful integration of HKGs across various health domains, ranging from fine-grained basic science research to high-level clinical decision support and public health. Lastly, the paper highlights the opportunities for HKGs in the era of LLMs. This work aims to serve as a valuable resource for understanding the potential and opportunities of HKG in health research.</description>

      <title>Large AI Model Empowered Multimodal Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal signals, including text, audio, image, and video, can be integrated into Semantic Communication (SC) systems to provide an immersive experience with low latency and high quality at the semantic level. However, the multimodal SC has several challenges, including data heterogeneity, semantic ambiguity, and signal distortion during transmission. Recent advancements in large AI models, particularly in the Multimodal Language Model (MLM) and Large Language Model (LLM), offer potential solutions for addressing these issues. To this end, we propose a Large AI Model-based Multimodal SC (LAM-MSC) framework, where we first present the MLM-based Multimodal Alignment (MMA) that utilizes the MLM to enable the transformation between multimodal and unimodal data while preserving semantic consistency. Then, a personalized LLM-based Knowledge Base (LKB) is proposed, which allows users to perform personalized semantic extraction or recovery through the LLM. This effectively addresses the semantic ambiguity. Finally, we apply the Conditional Generative adversarial network-based channel Estimation (CGE) for estimating the wireless channel state information. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of fading channels in SC. Finally, we conduct simulations that demonstrate the superior performance of the LAM-MSC framework.</description>

      <title>Empowering Private Tutoring by Chaining Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has been applied in various aspects of online education to facilitate teaching and learning. However, few approaches has been made toward a complete AI-powered tutoring system. In this work, we explore the development of a full-fledged intelligent tutoring system powered by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), covering automatic course planning and adjusting, tailored instruction, and flexible quiz evaluation. To make the system robust to prolonged interaction and cater to individualized education, the system is decomposed into three inter-connected core processes-interaction, reflection, and reaction. Each process is implemented by chaining LLM-powered tools along with dynamically updated memory modules. Tools are LLMs prompted to execute one specific task at a time, while memories are data storage that gets updated during education process. Statistical results from learning logs demonstrate the effectiveness and mechanism of each tool usage. Subjective feedback from human users reveal the usability of each function, and comparison with ablation systems further testify the benefits of the designed processes in long-term interaction.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Novel GPT-4 APIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language model attacks typically assume one of two extreme threat models: full white-box access to model weights, or black-box access limited to a text generation API. However, real-world APIs are often more flexible than just text generation: these APIs expose "gray-box" access leading to new threat vectors. To explore this, we red-team three new functionalities exposed in the GPT-4 APIs: fine-tuning, function calling and knowledge retrieval. We find that fine-tuning a model on as few as 15 harmful examples or 100 benign examples can remove core safeguards from GPT-4, enabling a range of harmful outputs. Furthermore, we find that GPT-4 Assistants readily divulge the function call schema and can be made to execute arbitrary function calls. Finally, we find that knowledge retrieval can be hijacked by injecting instructions into retrieval documents. These vulnerabilities highlight that any additions to the functionality exposed by an API can create new vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>Credit Risk Meets Large Language Models: Building a Risk Indicator from Loan Descriptions in P2P Lending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has emerged as a distinctive financing mechanism, linking borrowers with lenders through online platforms. However, P2P lending faces the challenge of information asymmetry, as lenders often lack sufficient data to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue by leveraging the textual descriptions provided by borrowers during the loan application process. Our methodology involves processing these textual descriptions using a Large Language Model (LLM), a powerful tool capable of discerning patterns and semantics within the text. Transfer learning is applied to adapt the LLM to the specific task at hand.
  Our results derived from the analysis of the Lending Club dataset show that the risk score generated by BERT, a widely used LLM, significantly improves the performance of credit risk classifiers. However, the inherent opacity of LLM-based systems, coupled with uncertainties about potential biases, underscores critical considerations for regulatory frameworks and engenders trust-related concerns among end-users, opening new avenues for future research in the dynamic landscape of P2P lending and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Conceptual Understanding in Multimodal Contrastive Learning through Hard Negative Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current multimodal models leveraging contrastive learning often face limitations in developing fine-grained conceptual understanding. This is due to random negative samples during pretraining, causing almost exclusively very dissimilar concepts to be compared in the loss function. Consequently, the models struggle with fine-grained semantic differences. To address this problem, we introduce a novel pretraining method incorporating synthetic hard negative text examples. The hard negatives permute terms corresponding to visual concepts, leading to a more fine-grained visual and textual concept alignment. Further, we introduce InpaintCOCO, a new challenging dataset for assessing the fine-grained alignment of colors, objects, and sizes in vision-language models. We created the dataset using generative inpainting from COCO images by changing the visual concepts so that the images no longer match their original captions. Our results show significant improvements in fine-grained concept understanding across a wide range of vision-language datasets, including our InpaintCOCO dataset.</description>

      <title>Blended RAG: Improving RAG (Retriever-Augmented Generation) Accuracy with Semantic Search and Hybrid Query-Based Retrievers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach to infuse a private knowledge base of documents with Large Language Models (LLM) to build Generative Q\&amp;A (Question-Answering) systems. However, RAG accuracy becomes increasingly challenging as the corpus of documents scales up, with Retrievers playing an outsized role in the overall RAG accuracy by extracting the most relevant document from the corpus to provide context to the LLM. In this paper, we propose the 'Blended RAG' method of leveraging semantic search techniques, such as Dense Vector indexes and Sparse Encoder indexes, blended with hybrid query strategies. Our study achieves better retrieval results and sets new benchmarks for IR (Information Retrieval) datasets like NQ and TREC-COVID datasets. We further extend such a 'Blended Retriever' to the RAG system to demonstrate far superior results on Generative Q\&amp;A datasets like SQUAD, even surpassing fine-tuning performance.</description>

      <title>Selective Fine-tuning on LLM-labeled Data May Reduce Reliance on Human Annotation: A Case Study Using Schedule-of-Event Table Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their efficacy across a broad spectrum of tasks in healthcare applications. However, often LLMs need to be fine-tuned on task-specific expert annotated data to achieve optimal performance, which can be expensive and time consuming. In this study, we fine-tune PaLM-2 with parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using noisy labels obtained from gemini-pro 1.0 for the detection of Schedule-of-Event (SoE) tables, which specify care plan in clinical trial protocols. We introduce a filtering mechanism to select high-confidence labels for this table classification task, thereby reducing the noise in the auto-generated labels. We show that fine-tuned PaLM-2 with those labels achieves performance that exceeds the gemini-pro 1.0 and other LLMs. Furthermore, its performance is close to a PaLM-2 fine-tuned on labels obtained from non-expert annotators. Our results show that leveraging LLM-generated labels through powerful models like gemini-pro can potentially serve as a viable strategy for improving LLM performance through fine-tuning in specialized tasks, particularly in domains where expert annotations are scarce, expensive, or time-consuming to obtain.</description>

      <title>MarkLLM: An Open-Source Toolkit for LLM Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10051v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM watermarking, which embeds imperceptible yet algorithmically detectable signals in model outputs to identify LLM-generated text, has become crucial in mitigating the potential misuse of large language models. However, the abundance of LLM watermarking algorithms, their intricate mechanisms, and the complex evaluation procedures and perspectives pose challenges for researchers and the community to easily experiment with, understand, and assess the latest advancements. To address these issues, we introduce MarkLLM, an open-source toolkit for LLM watermarking. MarkLLM offers a unified and extensible framework for implementing LLM watermarking algorithms, while providing user-friendly interfaces to ensure ease of access. Furthermore, it enhances understanding by supporting automatic visualization of the underlying mechanisms of these algorithms. For evaluation, MarkLLM offers a comprehensive suite of 12 tools spanning three perspectives, along with two types of automated evaluation pipelines. Through MarkLLM, we aim to support researchers while improving the comprehension and involvement of the general public in LLM watermarking technology, fostering consensus and driving further advancements in research and application. Our code is available at https://github.com/THU-BPM/MarkLLM.</description>

Abstract: Though advanced in understanding visual information with human languages, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer from multimodal hallucinations. A natural concern is that during multimodal interaction, the generated hallucinations could influence the LVLMs' subsequent generation. Thus, we raise a question: When presented with a query relevant to the previously generated hallucination, will LVLMs be misled and respond incorrectly, even though the ground visual information exists? To answer this, we propose a framework called MMHalSnowball to evaluate LVLMs' behaviors when encountering generated hallucinations, where LVLMs are required to answer specific visual questions within a curated hallucinatory conversation. Crucially, our experiment shows that the performance of open-source LVLMs drops by at least $31\%$, indicating that LVLMs are prone to accept the generated hallucinations and make false claims that they would not have supported without distractions. We term this phenomenon Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing. To mitigate this, we further propose a training-free method called Residual Visual Decoding, where we revise the output distribution of LVLMs with the one derived from the residual visual input, providing models with direct access to the visual information. Experiments show that our method can mitigate more than $24\%$ of the snowballed multimodal hallucination while maintaining capabilities.</description>

      <title>Towards Explainable Evolution Strategies with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08331</link>

Abstract: This paper introduces an approach that integrates self-adaptive Evolution Strategies (ES) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the explainability of complex optimization processes. By employing a self-adaptive ES equipped with a restart mechanism, we effectively navigate the challenging landscapes of benchmark functions, capturing detailed logs of the optimization journey. The logs include fitness evolution, step-size adjustments and restart events due to stagnation. An LLM is then utilized to process these logs, generating concise, user-friendly summaries that highlight key aspects such as convergence behavior, optimal fitness achievements, and encounters with local optima. Our case study on the Rastrigin function demonstrates how our approach makes the complexities of ES optimization transparent. Our findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to bridge the gap between advanced optimization algorithms and their interpretability.</description>

      <title>Lost in Translation: Latent Concept Misalignment in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have broadened extensive downstream practical applications, but such models often encounter misalignment issues between text and image. Taking the generation of a combination of two disentangled concepts as an example, say given the prompt "a tea cup of iced coke", existing models usually generate a glass cup of iced coke because the iced coke usually co-occurs with the glass cup instead of the tea one during model training. The root of such misalignment is attributed to the confusion in the latent semantic space of text-to-image diffusion models, and hence we refer to the "a tea cup of iced coke" phenomenon as Latent Concept Misalignment (LC-Mis). We leverage large language models (LLMs) to thoroughly investigate the scope of LC-Mis, and develop an automated pipeline for aligning the latent semantics of diffusion models to text prompts. Empirical assessments confirm the effectiveness of our approach, substantially reducing LC-Mis errors and enhancing the robustness and versatility of text-to-image diffusion models.
