      <title>Towards Non-invasive and Personalized Management of Breast Cancer Patients from Multiparametric MRI via A Large Mixture-of-Modality-Experts Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging technique with the highest sensitivity for detecting breast cancer and is routinely used for women at high risk. Despite the comprehensive multiparametric protocol of breast MRI, existing artificial intelligence-based studies predominantly rely on single sequences and have limited validation. Here we report a large mixture-of-modality-experts model (MOME) that integrates multiparametric MRI information within a unified structure, offering a noninvasive method for personalized breast cancer management. We have curated the largest multiparametric breast MRI dataset, involving 5,205 patients from three hospitals in the north, southeast, and southwest of China, for the development and extensive evaluation of our model. MOME demonstrated accurate and robust identification of breast cancer. It achieved comparable performance for malignancy recognition to that of four senior radiologists and significantly outperformed a junior radiologist, with 0.913 AUROC, 0.948 AUPRC, 0.905 F1 score, and 0.723 MCC. Our findings suggest that MOME could reduce the need for biopsies in BI-RADS 4 patients with a ratio of 7.3%, classify triple-negative breast cancer with an AUROC of 0.709, and predict pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with an AUROC of 0.694. The model further supports scalable and interpretable inference, adapting to missing modalities and providing decision explanations by highlighting lesions and measuring modality contributions. MOME exemplifies a discriminative, robust, scalable, and interpretable multimodal model, paving the way for noninvasive, personalized management of breast cancer patients based on multiparametric breast imaging data.</description>

      <title>Image-Feature Weak-to-Strong Consistency: An Enhanced Paradigm for Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-level weak-to-strong consistency serves as the predominant paradigm in semi-supervised learning~(SSL) due to its simplicity and impressive performance. Nonetheless, this approach confines all perturbations to the image level and suffers from the excessive presence of naive samples, thus necessitating further improvement. In this paper, we introduce feature-level perturbation with varying intensities and forms to expand the augmentation space, establishing the image-feature weak-to-strong consistency paradigm. Furthermore, our paradigm develops a triple-branch structure, which facilitates interactions between both types of perturbations within one branch to boost their synergy. Additionally, we present a confidence-based identification strategy to distinguish between naive and challenging samples, thus introducing additional challenges exclusively for naive samples. Notably, our paradigm can seamlessly integrate with existing SSL methods. We apply the proposed paradigm to several representative algorithms and conduct experiments on multiple benchmarks, including both balanced and imbalanced distributions for labeled samples. The results demonstrate a significant enhancement in the performance of existing SSL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication based on Large Language Model for Underwater Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater communication is essential for environmental monitoring, marine biology research, and underwater exploration. Traditional underwater communication faces limitations like low bandwidth, high latency, and susceptibility to noise, while semantic communication (SC) offers a promising solution by focusing on the exchange of semantics rather than symbols or bits. However, SC encounters challenges in underwater environments, including information loss and difficulties in accurately identifying and transmitting critical information that aligns with the diverse requirements of underwater applications. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Semantic Communication (SC) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Our framework leverages visual LLMs to perform semantic compression and prioritization of underwater image data according to the query from users. By identifying and encoding key semantic elements within the images, the system selectively transmits high-priority information while applying higher compression rates to less critical regions. On the receiver side, an LLM-based recovery mechanism, along with Global Vision ControlNet and Key Region ControlNet networks, aids in reconstructing the images, thereby enhancing communication efficiency and robustness. Our framework reduces the overall data size to 0.8\% of the original. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, ensuring high-quality, semantically accurate image reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Can GPT-4 Models Detect Misleading Visualizations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of misleading visualizations online, particularly during critical events like public health crises and elections, poses a significant risk. This study investigates the capability of GPT-4 models (4V, 4o, and 4o mini) to detect misleading visualizations. Utilizing a dataset of tweet-visualization pairs containing various visual misleaders, we test these models under four experimental conditions with different levels of guidance. We show that GPT-4 models can detect misleading visualizations with moderate accuracy without prior training (naive zero-shot) and that performance notably improves when provided with definitions of misleaders (guided zero-shot). However, a single prompt engineering technique does not yield the best results for all misleader types. Specifically, providing the models with misleader definitions and examples (guided few-shot) proves more effective for reasoning misleaders, while guided zero-shot performs better for design misleaders. This study underscores the feasibility of using large vision-language models to detect visual misinformation and the importance of prompt engineering for optimized detection accuracy.</description>

      <title>Data-Free Class Incremental Gesture Recognition via Synthetic Feature Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-Free Class Incremental Learning (DFCIL) aims to enable models to continuously learn new classes while retraining knowledge of old classes, even when the training data for old classes is unavailable. Although explored primarily with image datasets by researchers, this study focuses on investigating DFCIL for skeleton-based gesture classification due to its significant real-world implications, particularly considering the growing prevalence of VR/AR headsets where gestures serve as the primary means of control and interaction. In this work, we made an intriguing observation: skeleton models trained with base classes(even very limited) demonstrate strong generalization capabilities to unseen classes without requiring additional training. Building on this insight, we developed Synthetic Feature Replay (SFR) that can sample synthetic features from class prototypes to replay for old classes and augment for new classes (under a few-shot setting). Our proposed method showcases significant advancements over the state-of-the-art, achieving up to 15% enhancements in mean accuracy across all steps and largely mitigating the accuracy imbalance between base classes and new classes.</description>

      <title>Building and better understanding vision-language models: insights and future directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of vision-language models (VLMs), which take images and texts as inputs and output texts, is rapidly evolving and has yet to reach consensus on several key aspects of the development pipeline, including data, architecture, and training methods. This paper can be seen as a tutorial for building a VLM. We begin by providing a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each, addressing the major challenges in the field, and suggesting promising research directions for underexplored areas. We then walk through the practical steps to build Idefics3-8B, a powerful VLM that significantly outperforms its predecessor Idefics2-8B, while being trained efficiently, exclusively on open datasets, and using a straightforward pipeline. These steps include the creation of Docmatix, a dataset for improving document understanding capabilities, which is 240 times larger than previously available datasets. We release the model along with the datasets created for its training.</description>

      <title>GSFusion: Online RGB-D Mapping Where Gaussian Splatting Meets TSDF Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional volumetric fusion algorithms preserve the spatial structure of 3D scenes, which is beneficial for many tasks in computer vision and robotics. However, they often lack realism in terms of visualization. Emerging 3D Gaussian splatting bridges this gap, but existing Gaussian-based reconstruction methods often suffer from artifacts and inconsistencies with the underlying 3D structure, and struggle with real-time optimization, unable to provide users with immediate feedback in high quality. One of the bottlenecks arises from the massive amount of Gaussian parameters that need to be updated during optimization. Instead of using 3D Gaussian as a standalone map representation, we incorporate it into a volumetric mapping system to take advantage of geometric information and propose to use a quadtree data structure on images to drastically reduce the number of splats initialized. In this way, we simultaneously generate a compact 3D Gaussian map with fewer artifacts and a volumetric map on the fly. Our method, GSFusion, significantly enhances computational efficiency without sacrificing rendering quality, as demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/goldoak/GSFusion.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Cross-Domain Problem for LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks and transformers have been widely applied to solve 3D object detection problems in the domain of autonomous driving. While existing models have achieved outstanding performance on most open benchmarks, the generalization ability of these deep networks is still in doubt. To adapt models to other domains including different cities, countries, and weather, retraining with the target domain data is currently necessary, which hinders the wide application of autonomous driving. In this paper, we deeply analyze the cross-domain performance of the state-of-the-art models. We observe that most models will overfit the training domains and it is challenging to adapt them to other domains directly. Existing domain adaptation methods for 3D object detection problems are actually shifting the models' knowledge domain instead of improving their generalization ability. We then propose additional evaluation metrics -- the side-view and front-view AP -- to better analyze the core issues of the methods' heavy drops in accuracy levels. By using the proposed metrics and further evaluating the cross-domain performance in each dimension, we conclude that the overfitting problem happens more obviously on the front-view surface and the width dimension which usually faces the sensor and has more 3D points surrounding it. Meanwhile, our experiments indicate that the density of the point cloud data also significantly influences the models' cross-domain performance.</description>

      <title>BankTweak: Adversarial Attack against Multi-Object Trackers by Manipulating Feature Banks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to construct moving trajectories for objects, and modern multi-object trackers mainly utilize the tracking-by-detection methodology. Initial approaches to MOT attacks primarily aimed to degrade the detection quality of the frames under attack, thereby reducing accuracy only in those specific frames, highlighting a lack of \textit{efficiency}. To improve efficiency, recent advancements manipulate object positions to cause persistent identity (ID) switches during the association phase, even after the attack ends within a few frames. However, these position-manipulating attacks have inherent limitations, as they can be easily counteracted by adjusting distance-related parameters in the association phase, revealing a lack of \textit{robustness}. In this paper, we present \textsf{BankTweak}, a novel adversarial attack designed for MOT trackers, which features efficiency and robustness. \textsf{BankTweak} focuses on the feature extractor in the association phase and reveals vulnerability in the Hungarian matching method used by feature-based MOT systems. Exploiting the vulnerability, \textsf{BankTweak} induces persistent ID switches (addressing \textit{efficiency}) even after the attack ends by strategically injecting altered features into the feature banks without modifying object positions (addressing \textit{robustness}). To demonstrate the applicability, we apply \textsf{BankTweak} to three multi-object trackers (DeepSORT, StrongSORT, and MOTDT) with one-stage, two-stage, anchor-free, and transformer detectors. Extensive experiments on the MOT17 and MOT20 datasets show that our method substantially surpasses existing attacks, exposing the vulnerability of the tracking-by-detection framework to \textsf{BankTweak}.</description>

      <title>Segment Anything Model for Grain Characterization in Hard Drive Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Development of new materials in hard drive designs requires characterization of nanoscale materials through grain segmentation. The high-throughput quickly changing research environment makes zero-shot generalization an incredibly desirable feature. For this reason, we explore the application of Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM) to this problem. We first analyze the out-of-the-box use of SAM. Then we discuss opportunities and strategies for improvement under the assumption of minimal labeled data availability. Out-of-the-box SAM shows promising accuracy at property distribution extraction. We are able to identify four potential areas for improvement and show preliminary gains in two of the four areas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection is widely employed in applications such as autonomous vehicles and robotics, yet current systems struggle with generalisation due to complex problem setup and limited training data. We introduce a novel pipeline that decouples 3D detection from 2D detection and depth prediction, using a diffusion-based approach to improve accuracy and support category-agnostic detection. Additionally, we introduce the Normalised Hungarian Distance (NHD) metric for an accurate evaluation of 3D detection results, addressing the limitations of traditional IoU and GIoU metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalisation across various object categories and datasets.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Vehicle Environmental Awareness via Federated Learning and Automatic Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle environmental awareness is a crucial issue in improving road safety. Through a variety of sensors and vehicle-to-vehicle communication, vehicles can collect a wealth of data. However, to make these data useful, sensor data must be integrated effectively. This paper focuses on the integration of image data and vehicle-to-vehicle communication data. More specifically, our goal is to identify the locations of vehicles sending messages within images, a challenge termed the vehicle identification problem. In this paper, we employ a supervised learning model to tackle the vehicle identification problem. However, we face two practical issues: first, drivers are typically unwilling to share privacy-sensitive image data, and second, drivers usually do not engage in data labeling. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a comprehensive solution to the vehicle identification problem, which leverages federated learning and automatic labeling techniques in combination with the aforementioned supervised learning model. We have validated the feasibility of our proposed approach through experiments.</description>

      <title>Symmetric masking strategy enhances the performance of Masked Image Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) is a technique in self-supervised learning that focuses on acquiring detailed visual representations from unlabeled images by estimating the missing pixels in randomly masked sections. It has proven to be a powerful tool for the preliminary training of Vision Transformers (ViTs), yielding impressive results across various tasks. Nevertheless, most MIM methods heavily depend on the random masking strategy to formulate the pretext task. This strategy necessitates numerous trials to ascertain the optimal dropping ratio, which can be resource-intensive, requiring the model to be pre-trained for anywhere between 800 to 1600 epochs. Furthermore, this approach may not be suitable for all datasets. In this work, we propose a new masking strategy that effectively helps the model capture global and local features. Based on this masking strategy, SymMIM, our proposed training pipeline for MIM is introduced. SymMIM achieves a new SOTA accuracy of 85.9\% on ImageNet using ViT-Large and surpasses previous SOTA across downstream tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation tasks, and so on.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Temporal Embedding of Objects in Video Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In video analysis, understanding the temporal context is crucial for recognizing object interactions, event patterns, and contextual changes over time. The proposed model leverages adjacency and semantic similarities between objects from neighboring video frames to construct context-aware temporal object embeddings. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on visual appearance, our temporal embedding model considers the contextual relationships between objects, creating a meaningful embedding space where temporally connected object's vectors are positioned in proximity. Empirical studies demonstrate that our context-aware temporal embeddings can be used in conjunction with conventional visual embeddings to enhance the effectiveness of downstream applications. Moreover, the embeddings can be used to narrate a video using a Large Language Model (LLM). This paper describes the intricate details of the proposed objective function to generate context-aware temporal object embeddings for video data and showcases the potential applications of the generated embeddings in video analysis and object classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Open-Set Deepfake Detection: A Parameter-Efficient Adaptation Method with Forgery Style Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-set face forgery detection poses significant security threats and presents substantial challenges for existing detection models. These detectors primarily have two limitations: they cannot generalize across unknown forgery domains and inefficiently adapt to new data. To address these issues, we introduce an approach that is both general and parameter-efficient for face forgery detection. It builds on the assumption that different forgery source domains exhibit distinct style statistics. Previous methods typically require fully fine-tuning pre-trained networks, consuming substantial time and computational resources. In turn, we design a forgery-style mixture formulation that augments the diversity of forgery source domains, enhancing the model's generalizability across unseen domains. Drawing on recent advancements in vision transformers (ViT) for face forgery detection, we develop a parameter-efficient ViT-based detection model that includes lightweight forgery feature extraction modules and enables the model to extract global and local forgery clues simultaneously. We only optimize the inserted lightweight modules during training, maintaining the original ViT structure with its pre-trained ImageNet weights. This training strategy effectively preserves the informative pre-trained knowledge while flexibly adapting the model to the task of Deepfake detection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the designed model achieves state-of-the-art generalizability with significantly reduced trainable parameters, representing an important step toward open-set Deepfake detection in the wild.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facial recognition systems are susceptible to both physical and digital attacks, posing significant security risks. Traditional approaches often treat these two attack types separately due to their distinct characteristics. Thus, when being combined attacked, almost all methods could not deal. Some studies attempt to combine the sparse data from both types of attacks into a single dataset and try to find a common feature space, which is often impractical due to the space is difficult to be found or even non-existent. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that uses the sparse model to handle sparse data, utilizing different parameter groups to process distinct regions of the sparse feature space. Specifically, we employ the Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework in our model, expert parameters are matched to tokens with varying weights during training and adaptively activated during testing. However, the traditional MoE struggles with the complex and irregular classification boundaries of this problem. Thus, we introduce a flexible self-adapting weighting mechanism, enabling the model to better fit and adapt. In this paper, we proposed La-SoftMoE CLIP, which allows for more flexible adaptation to the Unified Attack Detection (UAD) task, significantly enhancing the model's capability to handle diversity attacks. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed method has SOTA performance.</description>

      <title>VALE: A Multimodal Visual and Language Explanation Framework for Image Classifiers using eXplainable AI and Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have revolutionized various fields by enabling task automation and reducing human error. However, their internal workings and decision-making processes remain obscure due to their black box nature. Consequently, the lack of interpretability limits the application of these models in high-risk scenarios. To address this issue, the emerging field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to explain and interpret the inner workings of DNNs. Despite advancements, XAI faces challenges such as the semantic gap between machine and human understanding, the trade-off between interpretability and performance, and the need for context-specific explanations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal framework named VALE Visual and Language Explanation. VALE integrates explainable AI techniques with advanced language models to provide comprehensive explanations. This framework utilizes visual explanations from XAI tools, an advanced zero-shot image segmentation model, and a visual language model to generate corresponding textual explanations. By combining visual and textual explanations, VALE bridges the semantic gap between machine outputs and human interpretation, delivering results that are more comprehensible to users. In this paper, we conduct a pilot study of the VALE framework for image classification tasks. Specifically, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) are used to identify the most influential regions in classified images. The object of interest is then extracted using the Segment Anything Model (SAM), and explanations are generated using state-of-the-art pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Extensive experimental studies are performed on two datasets: the ImageNet dataset and a custom underwater SONAR image dataset, demonstrating VALEs real-world applicability in underwater image classification.</description>

      <title>From Few to More: Scribble-based Medical Image Segmentation via Masked Context Modeling and Continuous Pseudo Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scribble-based weakly supervised segmentation techniques offer comparable performance to fully supervised methods while significantly reducing annotation costs, making them an appealing alternative. Existing methods often rely on auxiliary tasks to enforce semantic consistency and use hard pseudo labels for supervision. However, these methods often overlook the unique requirements of models trained with sparse annotations. Since the model must predict pixel-wise segmentation maps with limited annotations, the ability to handle varying levels of annotation richness is critical. In this paper, we adopt the principle of `from few to more' and propose MaCo, a weakly supervised framework designed for medical image segmentation. MaCo employs masked context modeling (MCM) and continuous pseudo labels (CPL). MCM uses an attention-based masking strategy to disrupt the input image, compelling the model's predictions to remain consistent with those of the original image. CPL converts scribble annotations into continuous pixel-wise labels by applying an exponential decay function to distance maps, resulting in continuous maps that represent the confidence of each pixel belonging to a specific category, rather than using hard pseudo labels. We evaluate MaCo against other weakly supervised methods using three public datasets. The results indicate that MaCo outperforms competing methods across all datasets, setting a new record in weakly supervised medical image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Staircase Cascaded Fusion of Lightweight Local Pattern Recognition and Long-Range Dependencies for Structural Crack Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting cracks with pixel-level precision for key structures is a significant challenge, as existing methods struggle to effectively integrate local textures and pixel dependencies of cracks. Furthermore, these methods often possess numerous parameters and substantial computational requirements, complicating deployment on edge devices. In this paper, we propose a staircase cascaded fusion crack segmentation network (CrackSCF) that generates high-quality crack segmentation maps using minimal computational resources. We constructed a staircase cascaded fusion module that effectively captures local patterns of cracks and long-range dependencies of pixels, and it can suppress background noise well. To reduce the computational resources required by the model, we introduced a lightweight convolution block, which replaces all convolution operations in the network, significantly reducing the required computation and parameters without affecting the network's performance. To evaluate our method, we created a challenging benchmark dataset called TUT and conducted experiments on this dataset and five other public datasets. The experimental results indicate that our method offers significant advantages over existing methods, especially in handling background noise interference and detailed crack segmentation. The F1 and mIoU scores on the TUT dataset are 0.8382 and 0.8473, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while requiring the least computational resources. The code and dataset is available at https://github.com/Karl1109/CrackSCF.</description>

      <title>O-Mamba: O-shape State-Space Model for Underwater Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) face significant challenges due to complex underwater lighting conditions. Recently, mamba-based methods have achieved promising results in image enhancement tasks. However, these methods commonly rely on Vmamba, which focuses only on spatial information modeling and struggles to deal with the cross-color channel dependency problem in underwater images caused by the differential attenuation of light wavelengths, limiting the effective use of deep networks. In this paper, we propose a novel UIE framework called O-mamba. O-mamba employs an O-shaped dual-branch network to separately model spatial and cross-channel information, utilizing the efficient global receptive field of state-space models optimized for underwater images. To enhance information interaction between the two branches and effectively utilize multi-scale information, we design a Multi-scale Bi-mutual Promotion Module. This branch includes MS-MoE for fusing multi-scale information within branches, Mutual Promotion module for interaction between spatial and channel information across branches, and Cyclic Multi-scale optimization strategy to maximize the use of multi-scale information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.The code is available at https://github.com/chenydong/O-Mamba.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models (FMs) has generated heightened interest in their applications that integrate vision and language. This paper investigates the capabilities of ChatGPT-4V and Gemini Pro for Street View Imagery, Built Environment, and Interior by evaluating their performance across various tasks. The assessments include street furniture identification, pedestrian and car counts, and road width measurement in Street View Imagery; building function classification, building age analysis, building height analysis, and building structure classification in the Built Environment; and interior room classification, interior design style analysis, interior furniture counts, and interior length measurement in Interior. The results reveal proficiency in length measurement, style analysis, question answering, and basic image understanding, but highlight limitations in detailed recognition and counting tasks. While zero-shot learning shows potential, performance varies depending on the problem domains and image complexities. This study provides new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of multimodal foundation models for practical challenges in Street View Imagery, Built Environment, and Interior. Overall, the findings demonstrate foundational multimodal intelligence, emphasizing the potential of FMs to drive forward interdisciplinary applications at the intersection of computer vision and language.</description>

      <title>MergeUp-augmented Semi-Weakly Supervised Learning for WSI Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in computational pathology and artificial intelligence have significantly improved whole slide image (WSI) classification. However, the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of manual annotations present substantial challenges. Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a promising weakly supervised learning approach for WSI classification. Recently research revealed employing pseudo bag augmentation can encourage models to learn various data, thus bolstering models' performance. While directly inheriting the parents' labels can introduce more noise by mislabeling in training. To address this issue, we translate the WSI classification task from weakly supervised learning to semi-weakly supervised learning, termed SWS-MIL, where adaptive pseudo bag augmentation (AdaPse) is employed to assign labeled and unlabeled data based on a threshold strategy. Using the "student-teacher" pattern, we introduce a feature augmentation technique, MergeUp, which merges bags with low-priority bags to enhance inter-category information, increasing training data diversity. Experimental results on the CAMELYON-16, BRACS, and TCGA-LUNG datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art approaches, affirming its efficacy in WSI classification.</description>

      <title>S3Simulator: A benchmarking Side Scan Sonar Simulator dataset for Underwater Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic sonar imaging systems are widely used for underwater surveillance in both civilian and military sectors. However, acquiring high-quality sonar datasets for training Artificial Intelligence (AI) models confronts challenges such as limited data availability, financial constraints, and data confidentiality. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel benchmark dataset of Simulated Side-Scan Sonar images, which we term as 'S3Simulator dataset'. Our dataset creation utilizes advanced simulation techniques to accurately replicate underwater conditions and produce diverse synthetic sonar imaging. In particular, the cutting-edge AI segmentation tool i.e. Segment Anything Model (SAM) is leveraged for optimally isolating and segmenting the object images, such as ships and planes, from real scenes. Further, advanced Computer-Aided Design tools i.e. SelfCAD and simulation software such as Gazebo are employed to create the 3D model and to optimally visualize within realistic environments, respectively. Further, a range of computational imaging techniques are employed to improve the quality of the data, enabling the AI models for the analysis of the sonar images. Extensive analyses are carried out on S3simulator as well as real sonar datasets to validate the performance of AI models for underwater object classification. Our experimental results highlight that the S3Simulator dataset will be a promising benchmark dataset for research on underwater image analysis. https://github.com/bashakamal/S3Simulator.</description>

      <title>Underwater SONAR Image Classification and Analysis using LIME-based Explainable Artificial Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning techniques have revolutionized image classification by mimicking human cognition and automating complex decision-making processes. However, the deployment of AI systems in the wild, especially in high-security domains such as defence, is curbed by the lack of explainability of the model. To this end, eXplainable AI (XAI) is an emerging area of research that is intended to explore the unexplained hidden black box nature of deep neural networks. This paper explores the application of the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tool to interpret the underwater image classification results, one of the first works in the domain to the best of our knowledge. Our study delves into the realm of SONAR image classification using a custom dataset derived from diverse sources, including the Seabed Objects KLSG dataset, the camera SONAR dataset, the mine SONAR images dataset, and the SCTD dataset. An extensive analysis of transfer learning techniques for image classification using benchmark Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures such as VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, etc. is carried out. On top of this classification model, a post-hoc XAI technique, viz. Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) are incorporated to provide transparent justifications for the model's decisions by perturbing input data locally to see how predictions change. Furthermore, Submodular Picks LIME (SP-LIME) a version of LIME particular to images, that perturbs the image based on the submodular picks is also extensively studied. To this end, two submodular optimization algorithms i.e. Quickshift and Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) are leveraged towards submodular picks. The extensive analysis of XAI techniques highlights interpretability of the results in a more human-compliant way, thus boosting our confidence and reliability.</description>

      <title>Semantic Alignment for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) towards the multi-image cross-modal instruction has received increasing attention and made significant progress, particularly in scenarios involving closely resembling images (e.g., change captioning). Existing MLLMs typically follow a two-step process in their pipelines: first, extracting visual tokens independently for each input image, and then aligning these visual tokens from different images with the Large Language Model (LLM) in its textual feature space. However, the independent extraction of visual tokens for each image may result in different semantics being prioritized for different images in the first step, leading to a lack of preservation of linking information among images for subsequent LLM analysis. This issue becomes more serious in scenarios where significant variations exist among the images (e.g., visual storytelling). To address this challenge, we introduce Semantic Alignment for Multi-modal large language models (SAM). By involving the bidirectional semantic guidance between different images in the visual-token extraction process, SAM aims to enhance the preservation of linking information for coherent analysis and align the semantics of different images before feeding them into LLM. As the test bed, we propose a large-scale dataset named MmLINK consisting of 69K samples. Different from most existing datasets for MLLMs fine-tuning, our MmLINK dataset comprises multi-modal instructions with significantly diverse images. Extensive experiments on the group captioning task and the storytelling task prove the effectiveness of our SAM model, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+37% for group captioning and +22% for storytelling on CIDEr score).

      <title>Frequency-aware Feature Fusion for Dense Image Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense image prediction tasks demand features with strong category information and precise spatial boundary details at high resolution. To achieve this, modern hierarchical models often utilize feature fusion, directly adding upsampled coarse features from deep layers and high-resolution features from lower levels. In this paper, we observe rapid variations in fused feature values within objects, resulting in intra-category inconsistency due to disturbed high-frequency features. Additionally, blurred boundaries in fused features lack accurate high frequency, leading to boundary displacement. Building upon these observations, we propose Frequency-Aware Feature Fusion (FreqFusion), integrating an Adaptive Low-Pass Filter (ALPF) generator, an offset generator, and an Adaptive High-Pass Filter (AHPF) generator. The ALPF generator predicts spatially-variant low-pass filters to attenuate high-frequency components within objects, reducing intra-class inconsistency during upsampling. The offset generator refines large inconsistent features and thin boundaries by replacing inconsistent features with more consistent ones through resampling, while the AHPF generator enhances high-frequency detailed boundary information lost during downsampling. Comprehensive visualization and quantitative analysis demonstrate that FreqFusion effectively improves feature consistency and sharpens object boundaries. Extensive experiments across various dense prediction tasks confirm its effectiveness. The code is made publicly available at https://github.com/Linwei-Chen/FreqFusion.</description>

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D motion synthesis seeks to create lifelike animations based on human speech, with potential uses in virtual reality, gaming, and the film production. Existing approaches reply solely on speech audio for motion generation, leading to inaccurate and inflexible synthesis results. To mitigate this problem, we introduce a novel text-guided 3D human motion synthesis method, termed \textit{T3M}. Unlike traditional approaches, T3M allows precise control over motion synthesis via textual input, enhancing the degree of diversity and user customization. The experiment results demonstrate that T3M can greatly outperform the state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations. We have publicly released our code at \href{https://github.com/Gloria2tt/T3M.git}{https://github.com/Gloria2tt/T3M.git}</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Potential of SAM2 for Biomedical Images and Videos: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unprecedented developments in segmentation foundational models have become a dominant force in the field of computer vision, introducing a multitude of previously unexplored capabilities in a wide range of natural images and videos. Specifically, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) signifies a noteworthy expansion of the prompt-driven paradigm into the domain of image segmentation. The recent introduction of SAM2 effectively extends the original SAM to a streaming fashion and demonstrates strong performance in video segmentation. However, due to the substantial distinctions between natural and medical images, the effectiveness of these models on biomedical images and videos is still under exploration. This paper presents an overview of recent efforts in applying and adapting SAM2 to biomedical images and videos. The findings indicate that while SAM2 shows promise in reducing annotation burdens and enabling zero-shot segmentation, its performance varies across different datasets and tasks. Addressing the domain gap between natural and medical images through adaptation and fine-tuning is essential to fully unleash SAM2's potential in clinical applications. To support ongoing research endeavors, we maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date SAM &amp; SAM2-related papers and projects at https://github.com/YichiZhang98/SAM4MIS.</description>

      <title>FLoD: Integrating Flexible Level of Detail into 3D Gaussian Splatting for Customizable Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves fast and high-quality renderings by using numerous small Gaussians, which leads to significant memory consumption. This reliance on a large number of Gaussians restricts the application of 3DGS-based models on low-cost devices due to memory limitations. However, simply reducing the number of Gaussians to accommodate devices with less memory capacity leads to inferior quality compared to the quality that can be achieved on high-end hardware. To address this lack of scalability, we propose integrating a Flexible Level of Detail (FLoD) to 3DGS, to allow a scene to be rendered at varying levels of detail according to hardware capabilities. While existing 3DGSs with LoD focus on detailed reconstruction, our method provides reconstructions using a small number of Gaussians for reduced memory requirements, and a larger number of Gaussians for greater detail. Experiments demonstrate our various rendering options with tradeoffs between rendering quality and memory usage, thereby allowing real-time rendering across different memory constraints. Furthermore, we show that our method generalizes to different 3DGS frameworks, indicating its potential for integration into future state-of-the-art developments.

      <title>ParGo: Bridging Vision-Language with Partial and Global Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents ParGo, a novel Partial-Global projector designed to connect the vision and language modalities for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous works that rely on global attention-based projectors, our ParGo bridges the representation gap between the separately pre-trained vision encoders and the LLMs by integrating global and partial views, which alleviates the overemphasis on prominent regions. To facilitate the effective training of ParGo, we collect a large-scale detail-captioned image-text dataset named ParGoCap-1M-PT, consisting of 1 million images paired with high-quality captions. Extensive experiments on several MLLM benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our ParGo, highlighting its superiority in aligning vision and language modalities. Compared to conventional Q-Former projector, our ParGo achieves an improvement of 259.96 in MME benchmark. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that ParGo significantly outperforms other projectors, particularly in tasks that emphasize detail perception ability.</description>

      <title>Animal Identification with Independent Foreground and Background Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method that robustly exploits background and foreground in visual identification of individual animals. Experiments show that their automatic separation, made easy with methods like Segment Anything, together with independent foreground and background-related modeling, improves results. The two predictions are combined in a principled way, thanks to novel Per-Instance Temperature Scaling that helps the classifier to deal with appearance ambiguities in training and to produce calibrated outputs in the inference phase. For identity prediction from the background, we propose novel spatial and temporal models. On two problems, the relative error w.r.t. the baseline was reduced by 22.3% and 8.8%, respectively. For cases where objects appear in new locations, an example of background drift, accuracy doubles.</description>

      <title>WildFusion: Individual Animal Identification with Calibrated Similarity Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method - WildFusion - for individual identification of a broad range of animal species. The method fuses deep scores (e.g., MegaDescriptor or DINOv2) and local matching similarity (e.g., LoFTR and LightGlue) to identify individual animals. The global and local information fusion is facilitated by similarity score calibration. In a zero-shot setting, relying on local similarity score only, WildFusion achieved mean accuracy, measured on 17 datasets, of 76.2%. This is better than the state-of-the-art model, MegaDescriptor-L, whose training set included 15 of the 17 datasets. If a dataset-specific calibration is applied, mean accuracy increases by 2.3% percentage points. WildFusion, with both local and global similarity scores, outperforms the state-of-the-art significantly - mean accuracy reached 84.0%, an increase of 8.5 percentage points; the mean relative error drops by 35%. We make the code and pre-trained models publicly available5, enabling immediate use in ecology and conservation.</description>

      <title>Find the Assembly Mistakes: Error Segmentation for Industrial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognizing errors in assembly and maintenance procedures is valuable for industrial applications, since it can increase worker efficiency and prevent unplanned down-time. Although assembly state recognition is gaining attention, none of the current works investigate assembly error localization. Therefore, we propose StateDiffNet, which localizes assembly errors based on detecting the differences between a (correct) intended assembly state and a test image from a similar viewpoint. StateDiffNet is trained on synthetically generated image pairs, providing full control over the type of meaningful change that should be detected. The proposed approach is the first to correctly localize assembly errors taken from real ego-centric video data for both states and error types that are never presented during training. Furthermore, the deployment of change detection to this industrial application provides valuable insights and considerations into the mechanisms of state-of-the-art change detection algorithms. The code and data generation pipeline are publicly available at: https://timschoonbeek.github.io/error_seg.</description>

      <title>State-of-the-Art Fails in the Art of Damage Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately detecting and classifying damage in analogue media such as paintings, photographs, textiles, mosaics, and frescoes is essential for cultural heritage preservation. While machine learning models excel in correcting global degradation if the damage operator is known a priori, we show that they fail to predict where the damage is even after supervised training; thus, reliable damage detection remains a challenge. We introduce DamBench, a dataset for damage detection in diverse analogue media, with over 11,000 annotations covering 15 damage types across various subjects and media. We evaluate CNN, Transformer, and text-guided diffusion segmentation models, revealing their limitations in generalising across media types.</description>

      <title>Image Segmentation in Foundation Model Era: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image segmentation is a long-standing challenge in computer vision, studied continuously over several decades, as evidenced by seminal algorithms such as N-Cut, FCN, and MaskFormer. With the advent of foundation models (FMs), contemporary segmentation methodologies have embarked on a new epoch by either adapting FMs (e.g., CLIP, Stable Diffusion, DINO) for image segmentation or developing dedicated segmentation foundation models (e.g., SAM). These approaches not only deliver superior segmentation performance, but also herald newfound segmentation capabilities previously unseen in deep learning context. However, current research in image segmentation lacks a detailed analysis of distinct characteristics, challenges, and solutions associated with these advancements. This survey seeks to fill this gap by providing a thorough review of cutting-edge research centered around FM-driven image segmentation. We investigate two basic lines of research -- generic image segmentation (i.e., semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation), and promptable image segmentation (i.e., interactive segmentation, referring segmentation, few-shot segmentation) -- by delineating their respective task settings, background concepts, and key challenges. Furthermore, we provide insights into the emergence of segmentation knowledge from FMs like CLIP, Stable Diffusion, and DINO. An exhaustive overview of over 300 segmentation approaches is provided to encapsulate the breadth of current research efforts. Subsequently, we engage in a discussion of open issues and potential avenues for future research. We envisage that this fresh, comprehensive, and systematic survey catalyzes the evolution of advanced image segmentation systems.</description>

      <title>Accuracy Improvement of Cell Image Segmentation Using Feedback Former</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of microscopy cell images by deep learning is a significant technique. We considered that the Transformers, which have recently outperformed CNNs in image recognition, could also be improved and developed for cell image segmentation. Transformers tend to focus more on contextual information than on detailed information. This tendency leads to a lack of detailed information for segmentation. Therefore, to supplement or reinforce the missing detailed information, we hypothesized that feedback processing in the human visual cortex should be effective. Our proposed Feedback Former is a novel architecture for semantic segmentation, in which Transformers is used as an encoder and has a feedback processing mechanism. Feature maps with detailed information are fed back to the lower layers from near the output of the model to compensate for the lack of detailed information which is the weakness of Transformers and improve the segmentation accuracy. By experiments on three cell image datasets, we confirmed that our method surpasses methods without feedback, demonstrating its superior accuracy in cell image segmentation. Our method achieved higher segmentation accuracy while consuming less computational cost than conventional feedback approaches. Moreover, our method offered superior precision without simply increasing the model size of Transformer encoder, demonstrating higher accuracy with lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>Optimal OnTheFly Feedback Control of Event Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-based vision sensors produce an asynchronous stream of events which are triggered when the pixel intensity variation exceeds a predefined threshold. Such sensors offer significant advantages, including reduced data redundancy, micro-second temporal resolution, and low power consumption, making them valuable for applications in robotics and computer vision. In this work, we consider the problem of video reconstruction from events, and propose an approach for dynamic feedback control of activation thresholds, in which a controller network analyzes the past emitted events and predicts the optimal distribution of activation thresholds for the following time segment. Additionally, we allow a user-defined target peak-event-rate for which the control network is conditioned and optimized to predict per-column activation thresholds that would eventually produce the best possible video reconstruction. The proposed OnTheFly control scheme is data-driven and trained in an end-to-end fashion using probabilistic relaxation of the discrete event representation. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms both fixed and randomly-varying threshold schemes by 6-12% in terms of LPIPS perceptual image dissimilarity metric, and by 49% in terms of event rate, achieving superior reconstruction quality while enabling a fine-tuned balance between performance accuracy and the event rate. Additionally, we show that sampling strategies provided by our OnTheFly control are interpretable and reflect the characteristics of the scene. Our results, derived from a physically-accurate simulator, underline the promise of the proposed methodology in enhancing the utility of event cameras for image reconstruction and other downstream tasks, paving the way for hardware implementation of dynamic feedback EVS control in silicon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drowsiness detection holds paramount importance in ensuring safety in workplaces or behind the wheel, enhancing productivity, and healthcare across diverse domains. Therefore accurate and real-time drowsiness detection plays a critical role in preventing accidents, enhancing safety, and ultimately saving lives across various sectors and scenarios. This comprehensive review explores the significance of drowsiness detection in various areas of application, transcending the conventional focus solely on driver drowsiness detection. We delve into the current methodologies, challenges, and technological advancements in drowsiness detection schemes, considering diverse contexts such as public transportation, healthcare, workplace safety, and beyond. By examining the multifaceted implications of drowsiness, this work contributes to a holistic understanding of its impact and the crucial role of accurate and real-time detection techniques in enhancing safety and performance. We identified weaknesses in current algorithms and limitations in existing research such as accurate and real-time detection, stable data transmission, and building bias-free systems. Our survey frames existing works and leads to practical recommendations like mitigating the bias issue by using synthetic data, overcoming the hardware limitations with model compression, and leveraging fusion to boost model performance. This is a pioneering work to survey the topic of drowsiness detection in such an entirely and not only focusing on one single aspect. We consider the topic of drowsiness detection as a dynamic and evolving field, presenting numerous opportunities for further exploration.</description>

      <title>BoostTrack++: using tracklet information to detect more objects in multiple object tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple object tracking (MOT) depends heavily on selection of true positive detected bounding boxes. However, this aspect of the problem is mostly overlooked or mitigated by employing two-stage association and utilizing low confidence detections in the second stage. Recently proposed BoostTrack attempts to avoid the drawbacks of multiple stage association approach and use low-confidence detections by applying detection confidence boosting. In this paper, we identify the limitations of the confidence boost used in BoostTrack and propose a method to improve its performance. To construct a richer similarity measure and enable a better selection of true positive detections, we propose to use a combination of shape, Mahalanobis distance and novel soft BIoU similarity. We propose a soft detection confidence boost technique which calculates new confidence scores based on the similarity measure and the previous confidence scores, and we introduce varying similarity threshold to account for lower similarity measure between detections and tracklets which are not regularly updated. The proposed additions are mutually independent and can be used in any MOT algorithm.
  Combined with the BoostTrack+ baseline, our method achieves near state of the art results on the MOT17 dataset and new state of the art HOTA and IDF1 scores on the MOT20 dataset.

      <title>EasyControl: Transfer ControlNet to Video Diffusion for Controllable Generation and Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the advancements in text-guided image generation technology exemplified by Stable Diffusion, video generation is gaining increased attention in the academic community. However, relying solely on text guidance for video generation has serious limitations, as videos contain much richer content than images, especially in terms of motion. This information can hardly be adequately described with plain text. Fortunately, in computer vision, various visual representations can serve as additional control signals to guide generation. With the help of these signals, video generation can be controlled in finer detail, allowing for greater flexibility for different applications. Integrating various controls, however, is nontrivial. In this paper, we propose a universal framework called EasyControl. By propagating and injecting condition features through condition adapters, our method enables users to control video generation with a single condition map. With our framework, various conditions including raw pixels, depth, HED, etc., can be integrated into different Unet-based pre-trained video diffusion models at a low practical cost. We conduct comprehensive experiments on public datasets, and both quantitative and qualitative results indicate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. EasyControl significantly improves various evaluation metrics across multiple validation datasets compared to previous works. Specifically, for the sketch-to-video generation task, EasyControl achieves an improvement of 152.0 on FVD and 19.9 on IS, respectively, in UCF101 compared with VideoComposer. For fidelity, our model demonstrates powerful image retention ability, resulting in high FVD and IS in UCF101 and MSR-VTT compared to other image-to-video models.</description>

      <title>Learning 2D Invariant Affordance Knowledge for 3D Affordance Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Object Affordance Grounding aims to predict the functional regions on a 3D object and has laid the foundation for a wide range of applications in robotics. Recent advances tackle this problem via learning a mapping between 3D regions and a single human-object interaction image. However, the geometric structure of the 3D object and the object in the human-object interaction image are not always consistent, leading to poor generalization. To address this issue, we propose to learn generalizable invariant affordance knowledge from multiple human-object interaction images within the same affordance category. Specifically, we introduce the \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}mage Guided Invariant-\textbf{F}eature-Aware 3D \textbf{A}ffordance \textbf{G}rounding (\textbf{MIFAG}) framework. It grounds 3D object affordance regions by identifying common interaction patterns across multiple human-object interaction images. First, the Invariant Affordance Knowledge Extraction Module (\textbf{IAM}) utilizes an iterative updating strategy to gradually extract aligned affordance knowledge from multiple images and integrate it into an affordance dictionary. Then, the Affordance Dictionary Adaptive Fusion Module (\textbf{ADM}) learns comprehensive point cloud representations that consider all affordance candidates in multiple images. Besides, the Multi-Image and Point Affordance (\textbf{MIPA}) benchmark is constructed and our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various experimental comparisons.

      <title>Indoor scene recognition from images under visual corruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of indoor scenes is a critical component in various applications, such as intelligent robotics for assistive living. While deep learning has significantly advanced this field, models often suffer from reduced performance due to image corruption. This paper presents an innovative approach to indoor scene recognition that leverages multimodal data fusion, integrating caption-based semantic features with visual data to enhance both accuracy and robustness against corruption. We examine two multimodal networks that synergize visual features from CNN models with semantic captions via a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Our study shows that this fusion markedly improves model performance, with notable gains in Top-1 accuracy when evaluated against a corrupted subset of the Places365 dataset. Moreover, while standalone visual models displayed high accuracy on uncorrupted images, their performance deteriorated significantly with increased corruption severity. Conversely, the multimodal models demonstrated improved accuracy in clean conditions and substantial robustness to a range of image corruptions. These results highlight the efficacy of incorporating high-level contextual information through captions, suggesting a promising direction for enhancing the resilience of classification systems.</description>

      <title>VFM-Det: Towards High-Performance Vehicle Detection via Large Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing vehicle detectors are usually obtained by training a typical detector (e.g., YOLO, RCNN, DETR series) on vehicle images based on a pre-trained backbone (e.g., ResNet, ViT). Some researchers also exploit and enhance the detection performance using pre-trained large foundation models. However, we think these detectors may only get sub-optimal results because the large models they use are not specifically designed for vehicles. In addition, their results heavily rely on visual features, and seldom of they consider the alignment between the vehicle's semantic information and visual representations. In this work, we propose a new vehicle detection paradigm based on a pre-trained foundation vehicle model (VehicleMAE) and a large language model (T5), termed VFM-Det. It follows the region proposal-based detection framework and the features of each proposal can be enhanced using VehicleMAE. More importantly, we propose a new VAtt2Vec module that predicts the vehicle semantic attributes of these proposals and transforms them into feature vectors to enhance the vision features via contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on three vehicle detection benchmark datasets thoroughly proved the effectiveness of our vehicle detector. Specifically, our model improves the baseline approach by $+5.1\%$, $+6.2\%$ on the $AP_{0.5}$, $AP_{0.75}$ metrics, respectively, on the Cityscapes dataset.The source code of this work will be released at https://github.com/Event-AHU/VFM-Det.</description>

      <title>S4D: Streaming 4D Real-World Reconstruction with Gaussians and 3D Control Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the dynamic scene reconstruction using Gaussians has garnered increased interest. Mainstream approaches typically employ a global deformation field to warp a 3D scene in the canonical space. However, the inherently low-frequency nature of implicit neural fields often leads to ineffective representations of complex motions. Moreover, their structural rigidity can hinder adaptation to scenes with varying resolutions and durations. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel approach utilizing discrete 3D control points. This method models local rays physically and establishes a motion-decoupling coordinate system, which effectively merges traditional graphics with learnable pipelines for a robust and efficient local 6-degrees-of-freedom (6-DoF) motion representation. Additionally, we have developed a generalized framework that incorporates our control points with Gaussians. Starting from an initial 3D reconstruction, our workflow decomposes the streaming 4D real-world reconstruction into four independent submodules: 3D segmentation, 3D control points generation, object-wise motion manipulation, and residual compensation. Our experiments demonstrate that this method outperforms existing state-of-the-art 4D Gaussian Splatting techniques on both the Neu3DV and CMU-Panoptic datasets. Our approach also significantly accelerates training, with the optimization of our 3D control points achievable within just 2 seconds per frame on a single NVIDIA 4070 GPU.</description>

      <title>Improving the Classification Effect of Clinical Images of Diseases for Multi-Source Privacy Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy data protection in the medical field poses challenges to data sharing, limiting the ability to integrate data across hospitals for training high-precision auxiliary diagnostic models. Traditional centralized training methods are difficult to apply due to violations of privacy protection principles. Federated learning, as a distributed machine learning framework, helps address this issue, but it requires multiple hospitals to participate in training simultaneously, which is hard to achieve in practice. To address these challenges, we propose a medical privacy data training framework based on data vectors. This framework allows each hospital to fine-tune pre-trained models on private data, calculate data vectors (representing the optimization direction of model parameters in the solution space), and sum them up to generate synthetic weights that integrate model information from multiple hospitals. This approach enhances model performance without exchanging private data or requiring synchronous training. Experimental results demonstrate that this method effectively utilizes dispersed private data resources while protecting patient privacy. The auxiliary diagnostic model trained using this approach significantly outperforms models trained independently by a single hospital, providing a new perspective for resolving the conflict between medical data privacy protection and model training and advancing the development of medical intelligence.</description>

      <title>G3FA: Geometry-guided GAN for Face Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animating human face images aims to synthesize a desired source identity in a natural-looking way mimicking a driving video's facial movements. In this context, Generative Adversarial Networks have demonstrated remarkable potential in real-time face reenactment using a single source image, yet are constrained by limited geometry consistency compared to graphic-based approaches. In this paper, we introduce Geometry-guided GAN for Face Animation (G3FA) to tackle this limitation. Our novel approach empowers the face animation model to incorporate 3D information using only 2D images, improving the image generation capabilities of the talking head synthesis model. We integrate inverse rendering techniques to extract 3D facial geometry properties, improving the feedback loop to the generator through a weighted average ensemble of discriminators. In our face reenactment model, we leverage 2D motion warping to capture motion dynamics along with orthogonal ray sampling and volume rendering techniques to produce the ultimate visual output. To evaluate the performance of our G3FA, we conducted comprehensive experiments using various evaluation protocols on VoxCeleb2 and TalkingHead benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework compared to the state-of-the-art real-time face animation methods.</description>

      <title>Atlas Gaussians Diffusion for 3D Generation with Infinite Number of Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the latent diffusion model has proven effective in developing novel 3D generation techniques. To harness the latent diffusion model, a key challenge is designing a high-fidelity and efficient representation that links the latent space and the 3D space. In this paper, we introduce Atlas Gaussians, a novel representation for feed-forward native 3D generation. Atlas Gaussians represent a shape as the union of local patches, and each patch can decode 3D Gaussians. We parameterize a patch as a sequence of feature vectors and design a learnable function to decode 3D Gaussians from the feature vectors. In this process, we incorporate UV-based sampling, enabling the generation of a sufficiently large, and theoretically infinite, number of 3D Gaussian points. The large amount of 3D Gaussians enables high-quality details of generation results. Moreover, due to local awareness of the representation, the transformer-based decoding procedure operates on a patch level, ensuring efficiency. We train a variational autoencoder to learn the Atlas Gaussians representation, and then apply a latent diffusion model on its latent space for learning 3D Generation. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the prior arts of feed-forward native 3D generation.</description>

      <title>Map-Free Visual Relocalization Enhanced by Instance Knowledge and Depth Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Map-free relocalization technology is crucial for applications in autonomous navigation and augmented reality, but relying on pre-built maps is often impractical. It faces significant challenges due to limitations in matching methods and the inherent lack of scale in monocular images. These issues lead to substantial rotational and metric errors and even localization failures in real-world scenarios. Large matching errors significantly impact the overall relocalization process, affecting both rotational and translational accuracy. Due to the inherent limitations of the camera itself, recovering the metric scale from a single image is crucial, as this significantly impacts the translation error. To address these challenges, we propose a map-free relocalization method enhanced by instance knowledge and depth knowledge. By leveraging instance-based matching information to improve global matching results, our method significantly reduces the possibility of mismatching across different objects. The robustness of instance knowledge across the scene helps the feature point matching model focus on relevant regions and enhance matching accuracy. Additionally, we use estimated metric depth from a single image to reduce metric errors and improve scale recovery accuracy. By integrating methods dedicated to mitigating large translational and rotational errors, our approach demonstrates superior performance in map-free relocalization techniques.</description>

      <title>Evidential Deep Partial Multi-View Classification With Discount Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incomplete multi-view data classification poses significant challenges due to the common issue of missing views in real-world scenarios. Despite advancements, existing methods often fail to provide reliable predictions, largely due to the uncertainty of missing views and the inconsistent quality of imputed data. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel framework called Evidential Deep Partial Multi-View Classification (EDP-MVC). Initially, we use K-means imputation to address missing views, creating a complete set of multi-view data. However, the potential conflicts and uncertainties within this imputed data can affect the reliability of downstream inferences. To manage this, we introduce a Conflict-Aware Evidential Fusion Network (CAEFN), which dynamically adjusts based on the reliability of the evidence, ensuring trustworthy discount fusion and producing reliable inference outcomes. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets reveal EDP-MVC not only matches but often surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>CathAction: A Benchmark for Endovascular Intervention Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time visual feedback from catheterization analysis is crucial for enhancing surgical safety and efficiency during endovascular interventions. However, existing datasets are often limited to specific tasks, small scale, and lack the comprehensive annotations necessary for broader endovascular intervention understanding. To tackle these limitations, we introduce CathAction, a large-scale dataset for catheterization understanding. Our CathAction dataset encompasses approximately 500,000 annotated frames for catheterization action understanding and collision detection, and 25,000 ground truth masks for catheter and guidewire segmentation. For each task, we benchmark recent related works in the field. We further discuss the challenges of endovascular intentions compared to traditional computer vision tasks and point out open research questions. We hope that CathAction will facilitate the development of endovascular intervention understanding methods that can be applied to real-world applications. The dataset is available at https://airvlab.github.io/cathdata/.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning at the Intersection: Certified Robustness as a Tool for 3D Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents preliminary work on a novel connection between certified robustness in machine learning and the modeling of 3D objects. We highlight an intriguing link between the Maximal Certified Radius (MCR) of a classifier representing a space's occupancy and the space's Signed Distance Function (SDF). Leveraging this relationship, we propose to use the certification method of randomized smoothing (RS) to compute SDFs. Since RS' high computational cost prevents its practical usage as a way to compute SDFs, we propose an algorithm to efficiently run RS in low-dimensional applications, such as 3D space, by expressing RS' fundamental operations as Gaussian smoothing on pre-computed voxel grids. Our approach offers an innovative and practical tool to compute SDFs, validated through proof-of-concept experiments in novel view synthesis. This paper bridges two previously disparate areas of machine learning, opening new avenues for further exploration and potential cross-domain advancements.</description>

      <title>ShapeICP: Iterative Category-level Object Pose and Shape Estimation from Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Category-level object pose and shape estimation from a single depth image has recently drawn research attention due to its wide applications in robotics and self-driving. The task is particularly challenging because the three unknowns, object pose, object shape, and model-to-measurement correspondences, are compounded together but only a single view of depth measurements is provided. The vast majority of the prior work heavily relies on data-driven approaches to obtain solutions to at least one of the unknowns and typically two, running with the risk of failing to generalize to unseen domains. The shape representations used in the prior work also mainly focus on point cloud and signed distance field (SDF). In stark contrast to the prior work, we approach the problem using an iterative estimation method that does not require learning from any pose-annotated data. In addition, we adopt a novel mesh-based object active shape model that has not been explored by the previous literature. Our algorithm, named ShapeICP, has its foundation in the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm but is equipped with additional features for the category-level pose and shape estimation task. The results show that even without using any pose-annotated data, ShapeICP surpasses many data-driven approaches that rely on the pose data for training, opening up new solution space for researchers to consider.</description>

      <title>Focus on Neighbors and Know the Whole: Towards Consistent Dense Multiview Text-to-Image Generator for 3D Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating dense multiview images from text prompts is crucial for creating high-fidelity 3D assets. Nevertheless, existing methods struggle with space-view correspondences, resulting in sparse and low-quality outputs. In this paper, we introduce CoSER, a novel consistent dense Multiview Text-to-Image Generator for Text-to-3D, achieving both efficiency and quality by meticulously learning neighbor-view coherence and further alleviating ambiguity through the swift traversal of all views. For achieving neighbor-view consistency, each viewpoint densely interacts with adjacent viewpoints to perceive the global spatial structure, and aggregates information along motion paths explicitly defined by physical principles to refine details. To further enhance cross-view consistency and alleviate content drift, CoSER rapidly scan all views in spiral bidirectional manner to aware holistic information and then scores each point based on semantic material. Subsequently, we conduct weighted down-sampling along the spatial dimension based on scores, thereby facilitating prominent information fusion across all views with lightweight computation. Technically, the core module is built by integrating the attention mechanism with a selective state space model, exploiting the robust learning capabilities of the former and the low overhead of the latter. Extensive evaluation shows that CoSER is capable of producing dense, high-fidelity, content-consistent multiview images that can be flexibly integrated into various 3D generation models.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Pre-training for Temporal Action Detection with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal action detection (TAD) is challenging, yet fundamental for real-world video applications. Recently, DETR-based models for TAD have been prevailing thanks to their unique benefits. However, transformers demand a huge dataset, and unfortunately data scarcity in TAD causes a severe degeneration. In this paper, we identify two crucial problems from data scarcity: attention collapse and imbalanced performance. To this end, we propose a new pre-training strategy, Long-Term Pre-training (LTP), tailored for transformers. LTP has two main components: 1) class-wise synthesis, 2) long-term pretext tasks. Firstly, we synthesize long-form video features by merging video snippets of a target class and non-target classes. They are analogous to untrimmed data used in TAD, despite being created from trimmed data. In addition, we devise two types of long-term pretext tasks to learn long-term dependency. They impose long-term conditions such as finding second-to-fourth or short-duration actions. Our extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performances in DETR-based methods on ActivityNet-v1.3 and THUMOS14 by a large margin. Moreover, we demonstrate that LTP significantly relieves the data scarcity issues in TAD.</description>

      <title>Interpretable breast cancer classification using CNNs on mammographic images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved promising results in breast cancer classification, yet their 'black-box' nature raises interpretability concerns. This research addresses the crucial need to gain insights into the decision-making process of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for mammogram classification, specifically focusing on the underlying reasons for the CNN's predictions of breast cancer. For CNNs trained on the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) dataset, we compared the post-hoc interpretability techniques LIME, Grad-CAM, and Kernel SHAP in terms of explanatory depth and computational efficiency. The results of this analysis indicate that Grad-CAM, in particular, provides comprehensive insights into the behavior of the CNN, revealing distinctive patterns in normal, benign, and malignant breast tissue. We discuss the implications of the current findings for the use of machine learning models and interpretation techniques in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>KonvLiNA: Integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Network with Linear Nystr\"om Attention for feature fusion in Crop Field Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crop field detection is a critical component of precision agriculture, essential for optimizing resource allocation and enhancing agricultural productivity. This study introduces KonvLiNA, a novel framework that integrates Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (cKAN) with Nystr\"om attention mechanisms for effective crop field detection. Leveraging KAN adaptive activation functions and the efficiency of Nystr\"om attention in handling largescale data, KonvLiNA significantly enhances feature extraction, enabling the model to capture intricate patterns in complex agricultural environments. Experimental results on rice crop dataset demonstrate KonvLiNA superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 0.415 AP and 0.459 AR with the Swin-L backbone, outperforming traditional YOLOv8 by significant margins. Additionally, evaluation on the COCO dataset showcases competitive performance across small, medium, and large objects, highlighting KonvLiNA efficacy in diverse agricultural settings. This work highlights the potential of hybrid KAN and attention mechanisms for advancing precision agriculture through improved crop field detection and management.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a curated list of 90 objects essential for the navigation of blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals, encompassing road, sidewalk, and indoor environments. We develop the initial list by analyzing 21 publicly available videos featuring BLV individuals navigating various settings. Then, we refine the list through feedback from a focus group study involving blind, low-vision, and sighted companions of BLV individuals. A subsequent analysis reveals that most contemporary datasets used to train recent computer vision models contain only a small subset of the objects in our proposed list. Furthermore, we provide detailed object labeling for these 90 objects across 31 video segments derived from the original 21 videos. Finally, we make the object list, the 21 videos, and object labeling in the 31 video segments publicly available. This paper aims to fill the existing gap and foster the development of more inclusive and effective navigation aids for the BLV community.</description>

      <title>D&amp;M: Enriching E-commerce Videos with Sound Effects by Key Moment Detection and SFX Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Videos showcasing specific products are increasingly important for E-commerce. Key moments naturally exist as the first appearance of a specific product, presentation of its distinctive features, the presence of a buying link, etc. Adding proper sound effects (SFX) to these key moments, or video decoration with SFX (VDSFX), is crucial for enhancing the user engaging experience. Previous studies about adding SFX to videos perform video to SFX matching at a holistic level, lacking the ability of adding SFX to a specific moment. Meanwhile, previous studies on video highlight detection or video moment retrieval consider only moment localization, leaving moment to SFX matching untouched. By contrast, we propose in this paper D&amp;M, a unified method that accomplishes key moment detection and moment to SFX matching simultaneously. Moreover, for the new VDSFX task we build a large-scale dataset SFX-Moment from an E-commerce platform. For a fair comparison, we build competitive baselines by extending a number of current video moment detection methods to the new task. Extensive experiments on SFX-Moment show the superior performance of the proposed method over the baselines. Code and data will be released.</description>

      <title>CustomCrafter: Customized Video Generation with Preserving Motion and Concept Composition Abilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Customized video generation aims to generate high-quality videos guided by text prompts and subject's reference images. However, since it is only trained on static images, the fine-tuning process of subject learning disrupts abilities of video diffusion models (VDMs) to combine concepts and generate motions. To restore these abilities, some methods use additional video similar to the prompt to fine-tune or guide the model. This requires frequent changes of guiding videos and even re-tuning of the model when generating different motions, which is very inconvenient for users. In this paper, we propose CustomCrafter, a novel framework that preserves the model's motion generation and conceptual combination abilities without additional video and fine-tuning to recovery. For preserving conceptual combination ability, we design a plug-and-play module to update few parameters in VDMs, enhancing the model's ability to capture the appearance details and the ability of concept combinations for new subjects. For motion generation, we observed that VDMs tend to restore the motion of video in the early stage of denoising, while focusing on the recovery of subject details in the later stage. Therefore, we propose Dynamic Weighted Video Sampling Strategy. Using the pluggability of our subject learning modules, we reduce the impact of this module on motion generation in the early stage of denoising, preserving the ability to generate motion of VDMs. In the later stage of denoising, we restore this module to repair the appearance details of the specified subject, thereby ensuring the fidelity of the subject's appearance. Experimental results show that our method has a significant improvement compared to previous methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-camera tracking plays a pivotal role in various real-world applications. While end-to-end methods have gained significant interest in single-camera tracking, multi-camera tracking remains predominantly reliant on heuristic techniques. In response to this gap, this paper introduces Multi-Camera Tracking tRansformer (MCTR), a novel end-to-end approach tailored for multi-object detection and tracking across multiple cameras with overlapping fields of view. MCTR leverages end-to-end detectors like DEtector TRansformer (DETR) to produce detections and detection embeddings independently for each camera view. The framework maintains set of track embeddings that encaplusate global information about the tracked objects, and updates them at every frame by integrating the local information from the view-specific detection embeddings. The track embeddings are probabilistically associated with detections in every camera view and frame to generate consistent object tracks. The soft probabilistic association facilitates the design of differentiable losses that enable end-to-end training of the entire system. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on MMPTrack and AI City Challenge, two recently introduced large-scale multi-camera multi-object tracking datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor imaging and analysis are critical yet understudied in deep learning, limiting our ability for precise control and optimization in semiconductor manufacturing. We introduce a small-scale multimodal framework for analyzing semiconductor electron microscopy images (MAEMI) through vision-language instruction tuning. We generate a customized instruction-following dataset using large multimodal models on microscopic image analysis. We perform knowledge transfer from larger to smaller models through knowledge distillation, resulting in improved accuracy of smaller models on visual question answering (VQA) tasks. This approach eliminates the need for expensive, human expert-annotated datasets for microscopic image analysis tasks. Enterprises can further finetune MAEMI on their intellectual data, enhancing privacy and performance on low-cost consumer hardware. Our experiments show that MAEMI outperforms traditional methods, adapts to data distribution shifts, and supports high-throughput screening.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face anti-spoofing algorithms play a pivotal role in the robust deployment of face recognition systems against presentation attacks. Conventionally, full facial images are required by such systems to correctly authenticate individuals, but the widespread requirement of masks due to the current COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new challenges for these biometric authentication systems. Hence, in this work, we investigate the performance of presentation attack detection (PAD) algorithms under synthetic facial occlusions using masks and glasses. We have used five variants of masks to cover the lower part of the face with varying coverage areas (low-coverage, medium-coverage, high-coverage, round coverage), and 3D cues. We have also used different variants of glasses that cover the upper part of the face. We systematically tested the performance of four PAD algorithms under these occlusion attacks using a benchmark dataset. We have specifically looked at four different baseline PAD algorithms that focus on, texture, image quality, frame difference/motion, and abstract features through a convolutional neural network (CNN). Additionally we have introduced a new hybrid model that uses CNN and local binary pattern textures. Our experiment shows that adding the occlusions significantly degrades the performance of all of the PAD algorithms. Our results show the vulnerability of face anti-spoofing algorithms with occlusions, which could be in the usage of such algorithms in the post-pandemic era.</description>

      <title>LayerPano3D: Layered 3D Panorama for Hyper-Immersive Scene Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D immersive scene generation is a challenging yet critical task in computer vision and graphics. A desired virtual 3D scene should 1) exhibit omnidirectional view consistency, and 2) allow for free exploration in complex scene hierarchies. Existing methods either rely on successive scene expansion via inpainting or employ panorama representation to represent large FOV scene environments. However, the generated scene suffers from semantic drift during expansion and is unable to handle occlusion among scene hierarchies. To tackle these challenges, we introduce LayerPano3D, a novel framework for full-view, explorable panoramic 3D scene generation from a single text prompt. Our key insight is to decompose a reference 2D panorama into multiple layers at different depth levels, where each layer reveals the unseen space from the reference views via diffusion prior. LayerPano3D comprises multiple dedicated designs: 1) we introduce a novel text-guided anchor view synthesis pipeline for high-quality, consistent panorama generation. 2) We pioneer the Layered 3D Panorama as underlying representation to manage complex scene hierarchies and lift it into 3D Gaussians to splat detailed 360-degree omnidirectional scenes with unconstrained viewing paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates state-of-the-art 3D panoramic scene in both full view consistency and immersive exploratory experience. We believe that LayerPano3D holds promise for advancing 3D panoramic scene creation with numerous applications.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Modeling of Multiple Physical Indicators to Dynamically Phenotype Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection of autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder marked by social communication challenges, is crucial for timely intervention. Recent advancements have utilized naturalistic home videos captured via the mobile application GuessWhat. Through interactive games played between children and their guardians, GuessWhat has amassed over 3,000 structured videos from 382 children, both diagnosed with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This collection provides a robust dataset for training computer vision models to detect ASD-related phenotypic markers, including variations in emotional expression, eye contact, and head movements. We have developed a protocol to curate high-quality videos from this dataset, forming a comprehensive training set. Utilizing this set, we trained individual LSTM-based models using eye gaze, head positions, and facial landmarks as input features, achieving test AUCs of 86%, 67%, and 78%, respectively. To boost diagnostic accuracy, we applied late fusion techniques to create ensemble models, improving the overall AUC to 90%. This approach also yielded more equitable results across different genders and age groups. Our methodology offers a significant step forward in the early detection of ASD by potentially reducing the reliance on subjective assessments and making early identification more accessibly and equitable.</description>

      <title>MME-RealWorld: Could Your Multimodal LLM Challenge High-Resolution Real-World Scenarios that are Difficult for Humans?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has recently garnered widespread attention in the research community. However, we observe that existing benchmarks present several common barriers that make it difficult to measure the significant challenges that models face in the real world, including: 1) small data scale leads to a large performance variance; 2) reliance on model-based annotations results in restricted data quality; 3) insufficient task difficulty, especially caused by the limited image resolution. To tackle these issues, we introduce MME-RealWorld. Specifically, we collect more than $300$K images from public datasets and the Internet, filtering $13,366$ high-quality images for annotation. This involves the efforts of professional $25$ annotators and $7$ experts in MLLMs, contributing to $29,429$ question-answer pairs that cover $43$ subtasks across $5$ real-world scenarios, extremely challenging even for humans. As far as we know, MME-RealWorld is the largest manually annotated benchmark to date, featuring the highest resolution and a targeted focus on real-world applications. We further conduct a thorough evaluation involving $28$ prominent MLLMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Our results show that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where none of them reach $60\%$ accuracy. The challenges of perceiving high-resolution images and understanding complex real-world scenarios remain urgent issues to be addressed. The data and evaluation code are released at https://mme-realworld.github.io/ .</description>

Abstract: In this paper, Pro-HRnet-CNN, an innovative model combining HRNet and void-convolution techniques, is proposed for disease prediction under lung imaging. Through the experimental comparison on the authoritative LIDC-IDRI dataset, we found that compared with the traditional ResNet-50, Pro-HRnet-CNN showed better performance in the feature extraction and recognition of small-size nodules, significantly improving the detection accuracy. Particularly within the domain of detecting smaller targets, the model has exhibited a remarkable enhancement in accuracy, thereby pioneering an innovative avenue for the early identification and prognostication of pulmonary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) manifests as a multisystem disorder with significant neurological implications. This study addresses the critical need for robust classification models tailored to TSC in pediatric patients, introducing QResNet,a novel deep learning model seamlessly integrating conventional convolutional neural networks with quantum neural networks. The model incorporates a two-layer quantum layer (QL), comprising ZZFeatureMap and Ansatz layers, strategically designed for processing classical data within a quantum framework. A comprehensive evaluation, demonstrates the superior performance of QResNet in TSC MRI image classification compared to conventional 3D-ResNet models. These compelling findings underscore the potential of quantum computing to revolutionize medical imaging and diagnostics.Remarkably, this method surpasses conventional CNNs in accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics with the current dataset. Future research endeavors may focus on exploring the scalability and practical implementation of quantum algorithms in real-world medical imaging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Identifying Locally Turbulent Vortices within Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents an approach for the automatic detection of locally turbulent vortices within turbulent 2D flows such as instabilites. First, given a time step of the flow, methods from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) are leveraged to extract the geometry of the vortices. Specifically, the enstrophy of the flow is simplified by topological persistence, and the vortices are extracted by collecting the basins of the simplified enstrophy's Morse complex. Next, the local kinetic energy power spectrum is computed for each vortex. We introduce a set of indicators based on the kinetic energy power spectrum to estimate the correlation between the vortex's behavior and that of an idealized turbulent vortex. Our preliminary experiments show the relevance of these indicators for distinguishing vortices which are turbulent from those which have not yet reached a turbulent state and thus known as laminar.</description>

      <title>Joint Image De-noising and Enhancement for Satellite-Based SAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reconstructed images from the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data suffer from multiplicative noise as well as low contrast level. These two factors impact the quality of the SAR images significantly and prevent any attempt to extract valuable information from the processed data. The necessity for mitigating these effects in the field of SAR imaging is of high importance. Therefore, in this paper, we address the aforementioned issues and propose a technique to handle these shortcomings simultaneously. In fact, we combine the de-noising and contrast enhancement processes into a unified algorithm. The image enhancement is performed based on the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) technique. The verification of the proposed algorithm is performed by experimental results based on the data that has been collected from the European Space Agency's ERS-2 satellite which operates in strip-map mode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, although U-Net network has made significant progress in the field of image segmentation, it still faces performance bottlenecks in remote sensing image segmentation. In this paper, we innovatively propose to introduce SimAM and CBAM attention mechanism in U-Net, and the experimental results show that after adding SimAM and CBAM modules alone, the model improves 17.41% and 12.23% in MIoU, and the Mpa and Accuracy are also significantly improved. And after fusing the two,the model performance jumps up to 19.11% in MIoU, and the Mpa and Accuracy are also improved by 16.38% and 14.8% respectively, showing excellent segmentation accuracy and visual effect with strong generalization ability and robustness. This study opens up a new path for remote sensing image segmentation technology and has important reference value for algorithm selection and improvement.</description>

      <title>One-shot Video Imitation via Parameterized Symbolic Abstraction Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning to manipulate dynamic and deformable objects from a single demonstration video holds great promise in terms of scalability. Previous approaches have predominantly focused on either replaying object relationships or actor trajectories. The former often struggles to generalize across diverse tasks, while the latter suffers from data inefficiency. Moreover, both methodologies encounter challenges in capturing invisible physical attributes, such as forces. In this paper, we propose to interpret video demonstrations through Parameterized Symbolic Abstraction Graphs (PSAG), where nodes represent objects and edges denote relationships between objects. We further ground geometric constraints through simulation to estimate non-geometric, visually imperceptible attributes. The augmented PSAG is then applied in real robot experiments. Our approach has been validated across a range of tasks, such as Cutting Avocado, Cutting Vegetable, Pouring Liquid, Rolling Dough, and Slicing Pizza. We demonstrate successful generalization to novel objects with distinct visual and physical properties.</description>

      <title>MultiMed: Massively Multimodal and Multitask Medical Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomedical data is inherently multimodal, consisting of electronic health records, medical imaging, digital pathology, genome sequencing, wearable sensors, and more. The application of artificial intelligence tools to these multifaceted sensing technologies has the potential to revolutionize the prognosis, diagnosis, and management of human health and disease. However, current approaches to biomedical AI typically only train and evaluate with one or a small set of medical modalities and tasks. This limitation hampers the development of comprehensive tools that can leverage the rich interconnected information across many heterogeneous biomedical sensors. To address this challenge, we present MultiMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate and enable large-scale learning across a wide spectrum of medical modalities and tasks. MultiMed consists of 2.56 million samples across ten medical modalities such as medical reports, pathology, genomics, and protein data, and is structured into eleven challenging tasks, including disease prognosis, protein structure prediction, and medical question answering. Using MultiMed, we conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art unimodal, multimodal, and multitask models. Our analysis highlights the advantages of training large-scale medical models across many related modalities and tasks. Moreover, MultiMed enables studies of generalization across related medical concepts, robustness to real-world noisy data and distribution shifts, and novel modality combinations to improve prediction performance. MultiMed will be publicly available and regularly updated and welcomes inputs from the community.</description>

      <title>Quantization-free Lossy Image Compression Using Integer Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lossy image compression is essential for efficient transmission and storage. Traditional compression methods mainly rely on discrete cosine transform (DCT) or singular value decomposition (SVD), both of which represent image data in continuous domains and therefore necessitate carefully designed quantizers. Notably, SVD-based methods are more sensitive to quantization errors than DCT-based methods like JPEG. To address this issue, we introduce a variant of integer matrix factorization (IMF) to develop a novel quantization-free lossy image compression method. IMF provides a low-rank representation of the image data as a product of two smaller factor matrices with bounded integer elements, thereby eliminating the need for quantization. We propose an efficient, provably convergent iterative algorithm for IMF using a block coordinate descent (BCD) scheme, with subproblems having closed-form solutions. Our experiments on the Kodak and CLIC 2024 datasets demonstrate that our IMF compression method consistently outperforms JPEG at low bit rates below 0.25 bits per pixel (bpp) and remains comparable at higher bit rates. We also assessed our method's capability to preserve visual semantics by evaluating an ImageNet pre-trained classifier on compressed images. Remarkably, our method improved top-1 accuracy by over 5 percentage points compared to JPEG at bit rates under 0.25 bpp. The project is available at https://github.com/pashtari/lrf .</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Attention and Parallel Filter Fusion Network for Multi-Source Data Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data joint classification is a crucial and yet challenging task in the field of remote sensing image interpretation. However, feature modeling in existing methods is deficient to exploit the abundant global, spectral, and local features simultaneously, leading to sub-optimal classification performance. To solve the problem, we propose a hierarchical attention and parallel filter fusion network for multi-source data classification. Concretely, we design a hierarchical attention module for hyperspectral feature extraction. This module integrates global, spectral, and local features simultaneously to provide more comprehensive feature representation. In addition, we develop parallel filter fusion module which enhances cross-modal feature interactions among different spatial locations in the frequency domain. Extensive experiments on two multi-source remote sensing data classification datasets verify the superiority of our proposed method over current state-of-the-art classification approaches. Specifically, our proposed method achieves 91.44% and 80.51% of overall accuracy (OA) on the respective datasets, highlighting its superior performance.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Variational Adversarial Active Learning via Learning to Rank and Agreement-Based Pseudo Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active learning aims to alleviate the amount of labor involved in data labeling by automating the selection of unlabeled samples via an acquisition function. For example, variational adversarial active learning (VAAL) leverages an adversarial network to discriminate unlabeled samples from labeled ones using latent space information. However, VAAL has the following shortcomings: (i) it does not exploit target task information, and (ii) unlabeled data is only used for sample selection rather than model training. To address these limitations, we introduce novel techniques that significantly improve the use of abundant unlabeled data during training and take into account the task information. Concretely, we propose an improved pseudo-labeling algorithm that leverages information from all unlabeled data in a semi-supervised manner, thus allowing a model to explore a richer data space. In addition, we develop a ranking-based loss prediction module that converts predicted relative ranking information into a differentiable ranking loss. This loss can be embedded as a rank variable into the latent space of a variational autoencoder and then trained with a discriminator in an adversarial fashion for sample selection. We demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over the state of the art on various image classification and segmentation benchmark datasets.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on a data-centric approach to machine learning applications in the context of Conway's Game of Life. Specifically, we consider the task of training a minimal architecture network to learn the transition rules of Game of Life for a given number of steps ahead, which is known to be challenging due to restrictions on the allowed number of trainable parameters. An extensive quantitative analysis showcases the benefits of utilizing a strategically designed training dataset, with its advantages persisting regardless of other parameters of the learning configuration, such as network initialization weights or optimization algorithm. Importantly, our findings highlight the integral role of domain expert insights in creating effective machine learning applications for constrained real-world scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research focuses on developing a real-time posture monitoring and risk assessment system for manual lifting tasks using advanced AI and computer vision technologies. Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a significant concern for workers involved in manual lifting, and traditional methods for posture correction are often inadequate due to delayed feedback and lack of personalized assessment. Our proposed solution integrates AI-driven posture detection, detailed keypoint analysis, risk level determination, and real-time feedback delivered through a user-friendly web interface. The system aims to improve posture, reduce the risk of MSDs, and enhance user engagement. The research involves comprehensive data collection, model training, and iterative development to ensure high accuracy and user satisfaction. The solution's effectiveness is evaluated against existing methodologies, demonstrating significant improvements in real-time feedback and risk assessment. This study contributes to the field by offering a novel approach to posture correction that addresses existing gaps and provides practical, immediate benefits to users.</description>

      <title>Universal dimensions of visual representation</title>

Abstract: Do neural network models of vision learn brain-aligned representations because they share architectural constraints and task objectives with biological vision or because they learn universal features of natural image processing? We characterized the universality of hundreds of thousands of representational dimensions from visual neural networks with varied construction. We found that networks with varied architectures and task objectives learn to represent natural images using a shared set of latent dimensions, despite appearing highly distinct at a surface level. Next, by comparing these networks with human brain representations measured with fMRI, we found that the most brain-aligned representations in neural networks are those that are universal and independent of a network's specific characteristics. Remarkably, each network can be reduced to fewer than ten of its most universal dimensions with little impact on its representational similarity to the human brain. These results suggest that the underlying similarities between artificial and biological vision are primarily governed by a core set of universal image representations that are convergently learned by diverse systems.</description>

      <title>Can AI Assistance Aid in the Grading of Handwritten Answer Sheets?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), there has been growing interest in using state of the art (SOTA) AI solutions to provide assistance in grading handwritten answer sheets. While a few commercial products exist, the question of whether AI-assistance can actually reduce grading effort and time has not yet been carefully considered in published literature. This work introduces an AI-assisted grading pipeline. The pipeline first uses text detection to automatically detect question regions present in a question paper PDF. Next, it uses SOTA text detection methods to highlight important keywords present in the handwritten answer regions of scanned answer sheets to assist in the grading process. We then evaluate a prototype implementation of the AI-assisted grading pipeline deployed on an existing e-learning management platform. The evaluation involves a total of 5 different real-life examinations across 4 different courses at a reputed institute; it consists of a total of 42 questions, 17 graders, and 468 submissions. We log and analyze the grading time for each handwritten answer while using AI assistance and without it. Our evaluations have shown that, on average, the graders take 31% less time while grading a single response and 33% less grading time while grading a single answer sheet using AI assistance.</description>

      <title>When Diffusion MRI Meets Diffusion Model: A Novel Deep Generative Model for Diffusion MRI Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is an advanced imaging technique characterizing tissue microstructure and white matter structural connectivity of the human brain. The demand for high-quality dMRI data is growing, driven by the need for better resolution and improved tissue contrast. However, acquiring high-quality dMRI data is expensive and time-consuming. In this context, deep generative modeling emerges as a promising solution to enhance image quality while minimizing acquisition costs and scanning time. In this study, we propose a novel generative approach to perform dMRI generation using deep diffusion models. It can generate high dimension (4D) and high resolution data preserving the gradients information and brain structure. We demonstrated our method through an image mapping task aimed at enhancing the quality of dMRI images from 3T to 7T. Our approach demonstrates highly enhanced performance in generating dMRI images when compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. This achievement underscores a substantial progression in enhancing dMRI quality, highlighting the potential of our novel generative approach to revolutionize dMRI imaging standards.</description>

      <title>SIMPLE: Simultaneous Multi-Plane Self-Supervised Learning for Isotropic MRI Restoration from Anisotropic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial in diagnosing various abdominal conditions and anomalies. Traditional MRI scans often yield anisotropic data due to technical constraints, resulting in varying resolutions across spatial dimensions, which limits diagnostic accuracy and volumetric analysis. Super-resolution (SR) techniques aim to address these limitations by reconstructing isotropic high-resolution images from anisotropic data. However, current SR methods often rely on indirect mappings and limited training data, focusing mainly on two-dimensional improvements rather than achieving true three-dimensional isotropy. We introduce SIMPLE, a Simultaneous Multi-Plane Self-Supervised Learning approach for isotropic MRI restoration from anisotropic data. Our method leverages existing anisotropic clinical data acquired in different planes, bypassing the need for simulated downsampling processes. By considering the inherent three-dimensional nature of MRI data, SIMPLE ensures realistic isotropic data generation rather than solely improving through-plane slices. This approach flexibility allows it to be extended to multiple contrast types and acquisition methods commonly used in clinical settings. Our experiments show that SIMPLE outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively using the Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and semi-quantitatively through radiologist evaluations. The generated isotropic volume facilitates more accurate volumetric analysis and 3D reconstructions, promising significant improvements in clinical diagnostic capabilities.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Label Adversarial Training for Deep Learning Robustness Against Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial training is one of the most effective methods for enhancing model robustness. Recent approaches incorporate adversarial distillation in adversarial training architectures. However, we notice two scenarios of defense methods that limit their performance: (1) Previous methods primarily use static ground truth for adversarial training, but this often causes robust overfitting; (2) The loss functions are either Mean Squared Error or KL-divergence leading to a sub-optimal performance on clean accuracy. To solve those problems, we propose a dynamic label adversarial training (DYNAT) algorithm that enables the target model to gradually and dynamically gain robustness from the guide model's decisions. Additionally, we found that a budgeted dimension of inner optimization for the target model may contribute to the trade-off between clean accuracy and robust accuracy. Therefore, we propose a novel inner optimization method to be incorporated into the adversarial training. This will enable the target model to adaptively search for adversarial examples based on dynamic labels from the guiding model, contributing to the robustness of the target model. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing a freeform surface to reflect or refract light to achieve a target distribution is a challenging inverse problem. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end optimization strategy for an optical surface mesh. Our formulation leverages a novel differentiable rendering model, and is directly driven by the difference between the resulting light distribution and the target distribution. We also enforce geometric constraints related to fabrication requirements, to facilitate CNC milling and polishing of the designed surface. To address the issue of local minima, we formulate a face-based optimal transport problem between the current mesh and the target distribution, which makes effective large changes to the surface shape. The combination of our optimal transport update and rendering-guided optimization produces an optical surface design with a resulting image closely resembling the target, while the fabrication constraints in our optimization help to ensure consistency between the rendering model and the final physical results. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated on a variety of target images using both simulated rendering and physical prototypes.</description>

Abstract: We address the problem of verifying neural networks against geometric transformations of the input image, including rotation, scaling, shearing, and translation. The proposed method computes provably sound piecewise linear constraints for the pixel values by using sampling and linear approximations in combination with branch-and-bound Lipschitz optimisation. A feature of the method is that it obtains tighter over-approximations of the perturbation region than the present state-of-the-art. We report results from experiments on a comprehensive set of benchmarks. We show that our proposed implementation resolves more verification cases than present approaches while being more computationally efficient.</description>

Abstract: Many people die from lung-related diseases every year. X-ray is an effective way to test if one is diagnosed with a lung-related disease or not. This study concentrates on categorizing three distinct types of lung X-rays: those depicting healthy lungs, those showing lung opacities, and those indicative of viral pneumonia. Accurately diagnosing the disease at an early phase is critical. In this paper, five different pre-trained models will be tested on the Lung X-ray Image Dataset. SqueezeNet, VGG11, ResNet18, DenseNet, and MobileNetV2 achieved accuracies of 0.64, 0.85, 0.87, 0.88, and 0.885, respectively. MobileNetV2, as the best-performing pre-trained model, will then be further analyzed as the base model. Eventually, our own model, MobileNet-Lung based on MobileNetV2, with fine-tuning and an additional layer of attention within feature layers, was invented to tackle the lung disease classification task and achieved an accuracy of 0.933. This result is significantly improved compared with all five pre-trained models.</description>

      <title>How Diffusion Models Learn to Factorize and Compose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are capable of generating photo-realistic images that combine elements which likely do not appear together in the training set, demonstrating the ability to compositionally generalize. Nonetheless, the precise mechanism of compositionality and how it is acquired through training remains elusive. Inspired by cognitive neuroscientific approaches, we consider a highly reduced setting to examine whether and when diffusion models learn semantically meaningful and factorized representations of composable features. We performed extensive controlled experiments on conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) trained to generate various forms of 2D Gaussian data. We found that the models learn factorized but not fully continuous manifold representations for encoding continuous features of variation underlying the data. With such representations, models demonstrate superior feature compositionality but limited ability to interpolate over unseen values of a given feature. Our experimental results further demonstrate that diffusion models can attain compositionality with few compositional examples, suggesting a more efficient way to train DDPMs. Finally, we connect manifold formation in diffusion models to percolation theory in physics, offering insight into the sudden onset of factorized representation learning. Our thorough toy experiments thus contribute a deeper understanding of how diffusion models capture compositional structure in data.</description>

      <title>Linear Combinations of Patches are Unreasonably Effective for Single-Image Denoising</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past decade, deep neural networks have revolutionized image denoising in achieving significant accuracy improvements by learning on datasets composed of noisy/clean image pairs. However, this strategy is extremely dependent on training data quality, which is a well-established weakness. To alleviate the requirement to learn image priors externally, single-image (a.k.a., self-supervised or zero-shot) methods perform denoising solely based on the analysis of the input noisy image without external dictionary or training dataset. This work investigates the effectiveness of linear combinations of patches for denoising under this constraint. Although conceptually very simple, we show that linear combinations of patches are enough to achieve state-of-the-art performance. The proposed parametric approach relies on quadratic risk approximation via multiple pilot images to guide the estimation of the combination weights. Experiments on images corrupted artificially with Gaussian noise as well as on real-world noisy images demonstrate that our method is on par with the very best single-image denoisers, outperforming the recent neural network based techniques, while being much faster and fully interpretable.</description>

      <title>Large-scale Pre-trained Models are Surprisingly Strong in Incremental Novel Class Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15975v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discovering novel concepts in unlabelled datasets and in a continuous manner is an important desideratum of lifelong learners. In the literature such problems have been partially addressed under very restricted settings, where novel classes are learned by jointly accessing a related labelled set (e.g., NCD) or by leveraging only a supervisedly pre-trained model (e.g., class-iNCD). In this work we challenge the status quo in class-iNCD and propose a learning paradigm where class discovery occurs continuously and truly unsupervisedly, without needing any related labelled set. In detail, we propose to exploit the richer priors from strong self-supervised pre-trained models (PTM). To this end, we propose simple baselines, composed of a frozen PTM backbone and a learnable linear classifier, that are not only simple to implement but also resilient under longer learning scenarios. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation on a multitude of benchmarks and show the effectiveness of our proposed baselines when compared with sophisticated state-of-the-art methods. The code is open source.</description>

      <title>Mapping Degeneration Meets Label Evolution: Learning Infrared Small Target Detection with Single Point Supervision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect infrared small targets in a fully supervised manner has gained remarkable research interests in recent years, but is highly labor expensive since a large number of per-pixel annotations are required. To handle this problem, in this paper, we make the first attempt to achieve infrared small target detection with point-level supervision. Interestingly, during the training phase supervised by point labels, we discover that CNNs first learn to segment a cluster of pixels near the targets, and then gradually converge to predict groundtruth point labels. Motivated by this "mapping degeneration" phenomenon, we propose a label evolution framework named label evolution with single point supervision (LESPS) to progressively expand the point label by leveraging the intermediate predictions of CNNs. In this way, the network predictions can finally approximate the updated pseudo labels, and a pixel-level target mask can be obtained to train CNNs in an end-to-end manner. We conduct extensive experiments with insightful visualizations to validate the effectiveness of our method. Experimental results show that CNNs equipped with LESPS can well recover the target masks from corresponding point labels, {and can achieve over 70% and 95% of their fully supervised performance in terms of pixel-level intersection over union (IoU) and object-level probability of detection (Pd), respectively.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in developing effective training and fast sampling techniques for diffusion models. A remarkable advancement is the use of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and their marginal-preserving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe data perturbation and generative modeling in a unified framework. In this paper, we carefully inspect the ODE-based sampling of a popular variance-exploding SDE and reveal several intriguing structures of its sampling dynamics. We discover that the data distribution and the noise distribution are smoothly connected with a quasi-linear sampling trajectory and another implicit denoising trajectory that even converges faster. Meanwhile, the denoising trajectory governs the curvature of the corresponding sampling trajectory and its finite differences yield various second-order samplers used in practice. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical relationship between the optimal ODE-based sampling and the classic mean-shift (mode-seeking) algorithm, with which we can characterize the asymptotic behavior of diffusion models and identify the empirical score deviation.

      <title>Seeing is not Believing: An Identity Hider for Human Vision Privacy Protection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00481v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive captured face images are stored in the database for the identification of individuals. However, these images can be observed unintentionally by data managers, which is not at the will of individuals and may cause privacy violations. Existing protection schemes can maintain identifiability but slightly change the facial appearance, rendering it still susceptible to the visual perception of the original identity by data managers. In this paper, we propose an effective identity hider for human vision protection, which can significantly change appearance to visually hide identity while allowing identification for face recognizers. Concretely, the identity hider benefits from two specially designed modules: 1) The virtual face generation module generates a virtual face with a new appearance by manipulating the latent space of StyleGAN2. In particular, the virtual face has a similar parsing map to the original face, supporting other vision tasks such as head pose detection. 2) The appearance transfer module transfers the appearance of the virtual face into the original face via attribute replacement. Meanwhile, identity information can be preserved well with the help of the disentanglement networks. In addition, diversity and background preservation are supported to meet the various requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed identity hider achieves excellent performance on privacy protection and identifiability preservation.</description>

      <title>UniM$^2$AE: Multi-modal Masked Autoencoders with Unified 3D Representation for 3D Perception in Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAE) play a pivotal role in learning potent representations, delivering outstanding results across various 3D perception tasks essential for autonomous driving. In real-world driving scenarios, it's commonplace to deploy multiple sensors for comprehensive environment perception. Despite integrating multi-modal features from these sensors can produce rich and powerful features, there is a noticeable challenge in MAE methods addressing this integration due to the substantial disparity between the different modalities. This research delves into multi-modal Masked Autoencoders tailored for a unified representation space in autonomous driving, aiming to pioneer a more efficient fusion of two distinct modalities. To intricately marry the semantics inherent in images with the geometric intricacies of LiDAR point clouds, we propose UniM$^2$AE. This model stands as a potent yet straightforward, multi-modal self-supervised pre-training framework, mainly consisting of two designs. First, it projects the features from both modalities into a cohesive 3D volume space to intricately marry the bird's eye view (BEV) with the height dimension. The extension allows for a precise representation of objects and reduces information loss when aligning multi-modal features. Second, the Multi-modal 3D Interactive Module (MMIM) is invoked to facilitate the efficient inter-modal interaction during the interaction process. Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes Dataset attest to the efficacy of UniM$^2$AE, indicating enhancements in 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation by 1.2\% NDS and 6.5\% mIoU, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/hollow-503/UniM2AE.</description>

This research explores the domain of microbial activity within the complex matrix of 3D soil structures, providing valuable understanding into both the existence and uniqueness of solutions and the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding PDE model. Our investigation results in the discovery of a global attractor, a fundamental feature with significant implications for long-term system behavior. To enhance the clarity of our findings, numerical simulations are employed to visually illustrate the attributes of this global attractor.</description>

      <title>ESVAE: An Efficient Spiking Variational Autoencoder with Reparameterizable Poisson Spiking Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, studies on image generation models of spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained the attention of many researchers. Variational autoencoders (VAEs), as one of the most popular image generation models, have attracted a lot of work exploring their SNN implementation. Due to the constrained binary representation in SNNs, existing SNN VAE methods implicitly construct the latent space by an elaborated autoregressive network and use the network outputs as the sampling variables. However, this unspecified implicit representation of the latent space will increase the difficulty of generating high-quality images and introduces additional network parameters. In this paper, we propose an efficient spiking variational autoencoder (ESVAE) that constructs an interpretable latent space distribution and design a reparameterizable spiking sampling method. Specifically, we construct the prior and posterior of the latent space as a Poisson distribution using the firing rate of the spiking neurons. Subsequently, we propose a reparameterizable Poisson spiking sampling method, which is free from the additional network. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted, and the experimental results show that the proposed ESVAE outperforms previous SNN VAE methods in reconstructed &amp; generated images quality. In addition, experiments demonstrate that ESVAE's encoder is able to retain the original image information more efficiently, and the decoder is more robust.

      <title>Spiking NeRF: Representing the Real-World Geometry by a Discontinuous Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A crucial reason for the success of existing NeRF-based methods is to build a neural density field for the geometry representation via multiple perceptron layers (MLPs). MLPs are continuous functions, however, real geometry or density field is frequently discontinuous at the interface between the air and the surface. Such a contrary brings the problem of unfaithful geometry representation. To this end, this paper proposes spiking NeRF, which leverages spiking neurons and a hybrid Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-Spiking Neural Network (SNN) framework to build a discontinuous density field for faithful geometry representation. Specifically, we first demonstrate the reason why continuous density fields will bring inaccuracy. Then, we propose to use the spiking neurons to build a discontinuous density field. We conduct a comprehensive analysis for the problem of existing spiking neuron models and then provide the numerical relationship between the parameter of the spiking neuron and the theoretical accuracy of geometry. Based on this, we propose a bounded spiking neuron to build the discontinuous density field. Our method achieves SOTA performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-3D generation have significantly contributed to the automation and democratization of 3D content creation. Building upon these developments, we aim to address the limitations of current methods in blending geometries and styles in text-to-3D generation. We introduce multi-view ControlNet, a novel depth-aware multi-view diffusion model trained on generated datasets from a carefully curated text corpus. Our multi-view ControlNet is then integrated into our two-stage pipeline, ControlDreamer, enabling text-guided generation of stylized 3D models. Additionally, we present a comprehensive benchmark for 3D style editing, encompassing a broad range of subjects, including objects, animals, and characters, to further facilitate research on diverse 3D generation. Our comparative analysis reveals that this new pipeline outperforms existing text-to-3D methods as evidenced by human evaluations and CLIP score metrics.

      <title>Object Recognition from Scientific Document based on Compartment Refinement Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09038v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid development of the internet in the past decade, it has become increasingly important to extract valuable information from vast resources efficiently, which is crucial for establishing a comprehensive digital ecosystem, particularly in the context of research surveys and comprehension. The foundation of these tasks focuses on accurate extraction and deep mining of data from scientific documents, which are essential for building a robust data infrastructure. However, parsing raw data or extracting data from complex scientific documents have been ongoing challenges. Current data extraction methods for scientific documents typically use rule-based (RB) or machine learning (ML) approaches. However, using rule-based methods can incur high coding costs for articles with intricate typesetting. Conversely, relying solely on machine learning methods necessitates annotation work for complex content types within the scientific document, which can be costly. Additionally, few studies have thoroughly defined and explored the hierarchical layout within scientific documents. The lack of a comprehensive definition of the internal structure and elements of the documents indirectly impacts the accuracy of text classification and object recognition tasks. From the perspective of analyzing the standard layout and typesetting used in the specified publication, we propose a new document layout analysis framework called CTBR(Compartment &amp; Text Blocks Refinement). Firstly, we define scientific documents into hierarchical divisions: base domain, compartment, and text blocks. Next, we conduct an in-depth exploration and classification of the meanings of text blocks. Finally, we utilize the results of text block classification to implement object recognition within scientific documents based on rule-based compartment segmentation.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Training on Purification (AToP): Advancing Both Robustness and Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16352v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to well-designed adversarial attacks. The most successful defense technique based on adversarial training (AT) can achieve optimal robustness against particular attacks but cannot generalize well to unseen attacks. Another effective defense technique based on adversarial purification (AP) can enhance generalization but cannot achieve optimal robustness. Meanwhile, both methods share one common limitation on the degraded standard accuracy. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel pipeline to acquire the robust purifier model, named Adversarial Training on Purification (AToP), which comprises two components: perturbation destruction by random transforms (RT) and purifier model fine-tuned (FT) by adversarial loss. RT is essential to avoid overlearning to known attacks, resulting in the robustness generalization to unseen attacks, and FT is essential for the improvement of robustness. To evaluate our method in an efficient and scalable way, we conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNette to demonstrate that our method achieves optimal robustness and exhibits generalization ability against unseen attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphics pipelines require physically-based rendering (PBR) materials, yet current 3D content generation approaches are built on RGB models. We propose to model the PBR image distribution directly, avoiding photometric inaccuracies in RGB generation and the inherent ambiguity in extracting PBR from RGB. As existing paradigms for cross-modal fine-tuning are not suited for PBR generation due to both a lack of data and the high dimensionality of the output modalities, we propose to train a new PBR model that is tightly linked to a frozen RGB model using a novel cross-network communication paradigm. As the base RGB model is fully frozen, the proposed method retains its general performance and remains compatible with e.g. IPAdapters for that base model.</description>

      <title>The All-Seeing Project V2: Towards General Relation Comprehension of the Open World</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19474v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the All-Seeing Project V2: a new model and dataset designed for understanding object relations in images. Specifically, we propose the All-Seeing Model V2 (ASMv2) that integrates the formulation of text generation, object localization, and relation comprehension into a relation conversation (ReC) task. Leveraging this unified task, our model excels not only in perceiving and recognizing all objects within the image but also in grasping the intricate relation graph between them, diminishing the relation hallucination often encountered by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To facilitate training and evaluation of MLLMs in relation understanding, we created the first high-quality ReC dataset ({AS-V2) which is aligned with the format of standard instruction tuning data. In addition, we design a new benchmark, termed Circular-based Relation Probing Evaluation (CRPE) for comprehensively evaluating the relation comprehension capabilities of MLLMs. Notably, our ASMv2 achieves an overall accuracy of 52.04 on this relation-aware benchmark, surpassing the 43.14 of LLaVA-1.5 by a large margin. We hope that our work can inspire more future research and contribute to the evolution towards artificial general intelligence.

      <description>arXiv:2403.05379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated disease diagnosis using medical image analysis relies on deep learning, often requiring large labeled datasets for supervised model training. Diseases like Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) pose challenges due to scarce and costly annotations on a single-cell level. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) addresses weakly labeled scenarios but necessitates powerful encoders typically trained with labeled data. In this study, we explore Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) as a pre-training approach for MIL-based AML subtype classification from blood smears, removing the need for labeled data during encoder training. We investigate the three state-of-the-art SSL methods SimCLR, SwAV, and DINO, and compare their performance against supervised pre-training. Our findings show that SSL-pretrained encoders achieve comparable performance, showcasing the potential of SSL in MIL. This breakthrough offers a cost-effective and data-efficient solution, propelling the field of AI-based disease diagnosis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The open-domain video generation models are constrained by the scale of the training video datasets, and some less common actions still cannot be generated. Some researchers explore video editing methods and achieve action generation by editing the spatial information of the same action video. However, this method mechanically generates identical actions without understanding, which does not align with the characteristics of open-domain scenarios. In this paper, we propose AICL, which empowers the generative model with the ability to understand action information in reference videos, similar to how humans do, through in-context learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AICL effectively captures the action and achieves state-of-the-art generation performance across three typical video diffusion models on five metrics when using randomly selected categories from non-training datasets.</description>

      <title>Arc2Face: A Foundation Model for ID-Consistent Human Faces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents Arc2Face, an identity-conditioned face foundation model, which, given the ArcFace embedding of a person, can generate diverse photo-realistic images with an unparalleled degree of face similarity than existing models. Despite previous attempts to decode face recognition features into detailed images, we find that common high-resolution datasets (e.g. FFHQ) lack sufficient identities to reconstruct any subject. To that end, we meticulously upsample a significant portion of the WebFace42M database, the largest public dataset for face recognition (FR). Arc2Face builds upon a pretrained Stable Diffusion model, yet adapts it to the task of ID-to-face generation, conditioned solely on ID vectors. Deviating from recent works that combine ID with text embeddings for zero-shot personalization of text-to-image models, we emphasize on the compactness of FR features, which can fully capture the essence of the human face, as opposed to hand-crafted prompts. Crucially, text-augmented models struggle to decouple identity and text, usually necessitating some description of the given face to achieve satisfactory similarity. Arc2Face, however, only needs the discriminative features of ArcFace to guide the generation, offering a robust prior for a plethora of tasks where ID consistency is of paramount importance. As an example, we train a FR model on synthetic images from our model and achieve superior performance to existing synthetic datasets.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multi-modal Neural Scene Representations With Applications on Thermal Imaging</title>

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) quickly evolved as the new de-facto standard for the task of novel view synthesis when trained on a set of RGB images. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of neural scene representations, such as NeRFs, in the context of multi-modal learning. Specifically, we present four different strategies of how to incorporate a second modality, other than RGB, into NeRFs: (1) training from scratch independently on both modalities; (2) pre-training on RGB and fine-tuning on the second modality; (3) adding a second branch; and (4) adding a separate component to predict (color) values of the additional modality. We chose thermal imaging as second modality since it strongly differs from RGB in terms of radiosity, making it challenging to integrate into neural scene representations. For the evaluation of the proposed strategies, we captured a new publicly available multi-view dataset, ThermalMix, consisting of six common objects and about 360 RGB and thermal images in total. We employ cross-modality calibration prior to data capturing, leading to high-quality alignments between RGB and thermal images. Our findings reveal that adding a second branch to NeRF performs best for novel view synthesis on thermal images while also yielding compelling results on RGB. Finally, we also show that our analysis generalizes to other modalities, including near-infrared images and depth maps. Project page: https://mert-o.github.io/ThermalNeRF/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding presents a significant challenge in computer vision, with wide-ranging applications in embodied agents and augmented reality systems. Existing methods adopt neurel rendering methods as 3D representations and jointly optimize color and semantic features to achieve rendering and scene understanding simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce Semantic Gaussians, a novel open-vocabulary scene understanding approach based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to distill knowledge from 2D pre-trained models to 3D Gaussians. Unlike existing methods, we design a versatile projection approach that maps various 2D semantic features from pre-trained image encoders into a novel semantic component of 3D Gaussians, which is based on spatial relationship and need no additional training. We further build a 3D semantic network that directly predicts the semantic component from raw 3D Gaussians for fast inference. The quantitative results on ScanNet segmentation and LERF object localization demonstates the superior performance of our method. Additionally, we explore several applications of Semantic Gaussians including object part segmentation, instance segmentation, scene editing, and spatiotemporal segmentation with better qualitative results over 2D and 3D baselines, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness on supporting diverse downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Robust Diffusion Models for Adversarial Purification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16067v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) based adversarial purification (AP) has shown to be the most powerful alternative to adversarial training (AT). However, these methods neglect the fact that pre-trained diffusion models themselves are not robust to adversarial attacks as well. Additionally, the diffusion process can easily destroy semantic information and generate a high quality image but totally different from the original input image after the reverse process, leading to degraded standard accuracy. To overcome these issues, a natural idea is to harness adversarial training strategy to retrain or fine-tune the pre-trained diffusion model, which is computationally prohibitive. We propose a novel robust reverse process with adversarial guidance, which is independent of given pre-trained DMs and avoids retraining or fine-tuning the DMs. This robust guidance can not only ensure to generate purified examples retaining more semantic content but also mitigate the accuracy-robustness trade-off of DMs for the first time, which also provides DM-based AP an efficient adaptive ability to new attacks. Extensive experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet to demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art results and exhibits generalization against different attacks.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Unconstrained Head Pose Estimation in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing research on unconstrained in-the-wild head pose estimation suffers from the flaws of its datasets, which consist of either numerous samples by non-realistic synthesis or constrained collection, or small-scale natural images yet with plausible manual annotations. To alleviate it, we propose the first semi-supervised unconstrained head pose estimation method SemiUHPE, which can leverage abundant easily available unlabeled head images. Technically, we choose semi-supervised rotation regression and adapt it to the error-sensitive and label-scarce problem of unconstrained head pose. Our method is based on the observation that the aspect-ratio invariant cropping of wild heads is superior to the previous landmark-based affine alignment given that landmarks of unconstrained human heads are usually unavailable, especially for less-explored non-frontal heads. Instead of using an empirically fixed threshold to filter out pseudo labeled heads, we propose dynamic entropy based filtering to adaptively remove unlabeled outliers as training progresses by updating the threshold in multiple stages. We then revisit the design of weak-strong augmentations and improve it by devising two novel head-oriented strong augmentations, termed pose-irrelevant cut-occlusion and pose-altering rotation consistency respectively. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that SemiUHPE outperforms existing methods greatly on public benchmarks under both the front-range and full-range settings.

      <title>Multi-rater Prompting for Ambiguous Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-rater annotations commonly occur when medical images are independently annotated by multiple experts (raters). In this paper, we tackle two challenges arisen in multi-rater annotations for medical image segmentation (called ambiguous medical image segmentation): (1) How to train a deep learning model when a group of raters produces a set of diverse but plausible annotations, and (2) how to fine-tune the model efficiently when computation resources are not available for re-training the entire model on a different dataset domain. We propose a multi-rater prompt-based approach to address these two challenges altogether. Specifically, we introduce a series of rater-aware prompts that can be plugged into the U-Net model for uncertainty estimation to handle multi-annotation cases. During the prompt-based fine-tuning process, only 0.3% of learnable parameters are required to be updated comparing to training the entire model. Further, in order to integrate expert consensus and disagreement, we explore different multi-rater incorporation strategies and design a mix-training strategy for comprehensive insight learning. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our new approach for ambiguous medical image segmentation on two public datasets while alleviating the heavy burden of model re-training.</description>

      <title>OMEGAS: Object Mesh Extraction from Large Scenes Guided by Gaussian Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction technologies have paved the way for high-quality and real-time rendering of complex 3D scenes. Despite these achievements, a notable challenge persists: it is difficult to precisely reconstruct specific objects from large scenes. Current scene reconstruction techniques frequently result in the loss of object detail textures and are unable to reconstruct object portions that are occluded or unseen in views. To address this challenge, we delve into the meticulous 3D reconstruction of specific objects within large scenes and propose a framework termed OMEGAS: Object Mesh Extraction from Large Scenes Guided by Gaussian Segmentation. Specifically, we proposed a novel 3D target segmentation technique based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which segments 3D consistent target masks in multi-view scene images and generates a preliminary target model. Moreover, to reconstruct the unseen portions of the target, we propose a novel target replenishment technique driven by large-scale generative diffusion priors. We demonstrate that our method can accurately reconstruct specific targets from large scenes, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our experiments show that OMEGAS significantly outperforms existing reconstruction methods across various scenarios. Our project page is at: https://github.com/CrystalWlz/OMEGAS</description>

      <title>MAML MOT: Multiple Object Tracking based on Meta-Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advancement of video analysis technology, the multi-object tracking (MOT) problem in complex scenes involving pedestrians is gaining increasing importance. This challenge primarily involves two key tasks: pedestrian detection and re-identification. While significant progress has been achieved in pedestrian detection tasks in recent years, enhancing the effectiveness of re-identification tasks remains a persistent challenge. This difficulty arises from the large total number of pedestrian samples in multi-object tracking datasets and the scarcity of individual instance samples. Motivated by recent rapid advancements in meta-learning techniques, we introduce MAML MOT, a meta-learning-based training approach for multi-object tracking. This approach leverages the rapid learning capability of meta-learning to tackle the issue of sample scarcity in pedestrian re-identification tasks, aiming to improve the model's generalization performance and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy on mainstream datasets in the MOT Challenge. This offers new perspectives and solutions for research in the field of pedestrian multi-object tracking.</description>

      <title>A Neurosymbolic Framework for Bias Correction in Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15886v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent efforts in interpreting Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) focus on translating the activation of CNN filters into a stratified Answer Set Program (ASP) rule-sets. The CNN filters are known to capture high-level image concepts, thus the predicates in the rule-set are mapped to the concept that their corresponding filter represents. Hence, the rule-set exemplifies the decision-making process of the CNN w.r.t the concepts that it learns for any image classification task. These rule-sets help understand the biases in CNNs, although correcting the biases remains a challenge. We introduce a neurosymbolic framework called NeSyBiCor for bias correction in a trained CNN. Given symbolic concepts, as ASP constraints, that the CNN is biased towards, we convert the concepts to their corresponding vector representations. Then, the CNN is retrained using our novel semantic similarity loss that pushes the filters away from (or towards) learning the desired/undesired concepts. The final ASP rule-set obtained after retraining, satisfies the constraints to a high degree, thus showing the revision in the knowledge of the CNN. We demonstrate that our NeSyBiCor framework successfully corrects the biases of CNNs trained with subsets of classes from the "Places" dataset while sacrificing minimal accuracy and improving interpretability.</description>

      <title>EMAG: Ego-motion Aware and Generalizable 2D Hand Forecasting from Egocentric Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting future human behavior from egocentric videos is a challenging but critical task for human intention understanding. Existing methods for forecasting 2D hand positions rely on visual representations and mainly focus on hand-object interactions. In this paper, we investigate the hand forecasting task and tackle two significant issues that persist in the existing methods: (1) 2D hand positions in future frames are severely affected by ego-motions in egocentric videos; (2) prediction based on visual information tends to overfit to background or scene textures, posing a challenge for generalization on novel scenes or human behaviors. To solve the aforementioned problems, we propose EMAG, an ego-motion-aware and generalizable 2D hand forecasting method. In response to the first problem, we propose a method that considers ego-motion, represented by a sequence of homography matrices of two consecutive frames. We further leverage modalities such as optical flow, trajectories of hands and interacting objects, and ego-motions, thereby alleviating the second issue. Extensive experiments on two large-scale egocentric video datasets, Ego4D and EPIC-Kitchens 55, verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, our model outperforms prior methods by 1.7% and 7.0% on intra and cross-dataset evaluations, respectively. Project page: https://masashi-hatano.github.io/EMAG/</description>

      <title>Accurate Explanation Model for Image Classifiers using Class Association Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image classification is a primary task in data analysis where explainable models are crucially demanded in various applications. Although amounts of methods have been proposed to obtain explainable knowledge from the black-box classifiers, these approaches lack the efficiency of extracting global knowledge regarding the classification task, thus is vulnerable to local traps and often leads to poor accuracy. In this study, we propose a generative explanation model that combines the advantages of global and local knowledge for explaining image classifiers. We develop a representation learning method called class association embedding (CAE), which encodes each sample into a pair of separated class-associated and individual codes. Recombining the individual code of a given sample with altered class-associated code leads to a synthetic real-looking sample with preserved individual characters but modified class-associated features and possibly flipped class assignments. A building-block coherency feature extraction algorithm is proposed that efficiently separates class-associated features from individual ones. The extracted feature space forms a low-dimensional manifold that visualizes the classification decision patterns. Explanation on each individual sample can be then achieved in a counter-factual generation manner which continuously modifies the sample in one direction, by shifting its class-associated code along a guided path, until its classification outcome is changed. We compare our method with state-of-the-art ones on explaining image classification tasks in the form of saliency maps, demonstrating that our method achieves higher accuracies.

      <title>TokenPacker: Efficient Visual Projector for Multimodal LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The visual projector serves as an essential bridge between the visual encoder and the Large Language Model (LLM) in a Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Typically, MLLMs adopt a simple MLP to preserve all visual contexts via one-to-one transformation. However, the visual tokens are redundant and can be considerably increased when dealing with high-resolution images, impairing the efficiency of MLLMs significantly. Some recent works have introduced resampler or abstractor to reduce the number of resulting visual tokens. Unfortunately, they fail to capture finer details and undermine the visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. In this work, we propose a novel visual projector, which adopts a coarse-to-fine scheme to inject the enriched characteristics to generate the condensed visual tokens. In specific, we first interpolate the visual features as a low-resolution point query, providing the overall visual representation as the foundation. Then, we introduce a region-to-point injection module that utilizes high-resolution, multi-level region-based cues as fine-grained reference keys and values, allowing them to be fully absorbed within the corresponding local context region. This step effectively updates the coarse point query, transforming it into an enriched one for the subsequent LLM reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach compresses the visual tokens by 75%~89%, while achieves comparable or even better performance across diverse benchmarks with significantly higher efficiency.

      <title>Multi-head Spatial-Spectral Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial-Spectral Mamba (SSM) improves computational efficiency and captures long-range dependencies, addressing Transformer limitations. However, traditional Mamba models overlook rich spectral information in HSIs and struggle with high dimensionality and sequential data. To address these issues, we propose the SSM with multi-head self-attention and token enhancement (MHSSMamba). This model integrates spectral and spatial information by enhancing spectral tokens and using multi-head attention to capture complex relationships between spectral bands and spatial locations. It also manages long-range dependencies and the sequential nature of HSI data, preserving contextual information across spectral bands. MHSSMamba achieved remarkable classification accuracies of 97.62\% on Pavia University, 96.92\% on the University of Houston, 96.85\% on Salinas, and 99.49\% on Wuhan-longKou datasets.

      <title>Spatial-Spectral Morphological Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the emergence of Transformers with self-attention mechanism has revolutionized the hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, these models face major challenges in computational efficiency, as their complexity increases quadratically with the sequence length. The Mamba architecture, leveraging a state space model (SSM), offers a more efficient alternative to Transformers. This paper introduces the Spatial-Spectral Morphological Mamba (MorpMamba) model in which, a token generation module first converts the HSI patch into spatial-spectral tokens. These tokens are then processed by morphological operations, which compute structural and shape information using depthwise separable convolutional operations. The extracted information is enhanced in a feature enhancement module that adjusts the spatial and spectral tokens based on the center region of the HSI sample, allowing for effective information fusion within each block. Subsequently, the tokens are refined through a multi-head self-attention which further improves the feature space. Finally, the combined information is fed into the state space block for classification and the creation of the ground truth map. Experiments on widely used HSI datasets demonstrate that the MorpMamba model outperforms (parametric efficiency) both CNN and Transformer models. The source code will be made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/MHassaanButt/MorpMamba}.</description>

      <title>LLaVA-VSD: Large Language-and-Vision Assistant for Visual Spatial Description</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual Spatial Description (VSD) aims to generate texts that describe the spatial relationships between objects within images. Traditional visual spatial relationship classification (VSRC) methods typically output the spatial relationship between two objects in an image, often neglecting world knowledge and lacking general language capabilities. In this paper, we propose a Large Language-and-Vision Assistant for Visual Spatial Description, named LLaVA-VSD, which is designed for the classification, description, and open-ended description of visual spatial relationships. Specifically, the model first constructs a VSD instruction-following dataset using given figure-caption pairs for the three tasks. It then employs LoRA to fine-tune a Large Language and Vision Assistant for VSD, which has 13 billion parameters and supports high-resolution images. Finally, a large language model (Qwen-2) is used to refine the generated sentences, enhancing their diversity and accuracy. LLaVA-VSD demonstrates excellent multimodal conversational capabilities and can follow open-ended instructions to assist with inquiries about object relationships in images.</description>

      <title>LaWa: Using Latent Space for In-Generation Image Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With generative models producing high quality images that are indistinguishable from real ones, there is growing concern regarding the malicious usage of AI-generated images. Imperceptible image watermarking is one viable solution towards such concerns. Prior watermarking methods map the image to a latent space for adding the watermark. Moreover, Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) generate the image in the latent space of a pre-trained autoencoder. We argue that this latent space can be used to integrate watermarking into the generation process. To this end, we present LaWa, an in-generation image watermarking method designed for LDMs. By using coarse-to-fine watermark embedding modules, LaWa modifies the latent space of pre-trained autoencoders and achieves high robustness against a wide range of image transformations while preserving perceptual quality of the image. We show that LaWa can also be used as a general image watermarking method. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LaWa outperforms previous works in perceptual quality, robustness against attacks, and computational complexity, while having very low false positive rate. Code is available here.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Analysis of White Blood Cell Differentiation in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients using a \beta-Variational Autoencoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomedical imaging and RNA sequencing with single-cell resolution improves our understanding of white blood cell diseases like leukemia. By combining morphological and transcriptomic data, we can gain insights into cellular functions and trajectoriess involved in blood cell differentiation. However, existing methodologies struggle with integrating morphological and transcriptomic data, leaving a significant research gap in comprehensively understanding the dynamics of cell differentiation. Here, we introduce an unsupervised method that explores and reconstructs these two modalities and uncovers the relationship between different subtypes of white blood cells from human peripheral blood smears in terms of morphology and their corresponding transcriptome. Our method is based on a beta-variational autoencoder ({\ss}-VAE) with a customized loss function, incorporating a R-CNN architecture to distinguish single-cell from background and to minimize any interference from artifacts. This implementation of {\ss}-VAE shows good reconstruction capability along with continuous latent embeddings, while maintaining clear differentiation between single-cell classes. Our novel approach is especially helpful to uncover the correlation of two latent features in complex biological processes such as formation of granules in the cell (granulopoiesis) with gene expression patterns. It thus provides a unique tool to improve the understanding of white blood cell maturation for biomedicine and diagnostics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the evaluation of multimodal models in the context of mathematical problems has become a valuable research field. Multimodal visual-textual mathematical reasoning serves as a critical indicator for evaluating the comprehension and complex multi-step quantitative reasoning abilities of MLLMs. However, previous multimodal math benchmarks have not sufficiently integrated visual and textual information. To address this gap, we proposed MathScape, a new benchmark that emphasizes the understanding and application of combined visual and textual information. MathScape is designed to evaluate photo-based math problem scenarios, assessing the theoretical understanding and application ability of MLLMs through a categorical hierarchical approach. We conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation on 11 advanced MLLMs, revealing that our benchmark is challenging even for the most sophisticated models. By analyzing the evaluation results, we identify the limitations of MLLMs, offering valuable insights for enhancing model performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Text-driven Object-Centric Style Transfer (TEXTOC), a novel method that guides style transfer at an object-centric level using textual inputs. The core of TEXTOC is our Patch-wise Co-Directional (PCD) loss, meticulously designed for precise object-centric transformations that are closely aligned with the input text. This loss combines a patch directional loss for text-guided style direction and a patch distribution consistency loss for even CLIP embedding distribution across object regions. It ensures a seamless and harmonious style transfer across object regions. Key to our method are the Text-Matched Patch Selection (TMPS) and Pre-fixed Region Selection (PRS) modules for identifying object locations via text, eliminating the need for segmentation masks. Lastly, we introduce an Adaptive Background Preservation (ABP) loss to maintain the original style and structural essence of the image's background. This loss is applied to dynamically identified background areas. Extensive experiments underline the effectiveness of our approach in creating visually coherent and textually aligned style transfers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computer-assisted surgery (CAS) systems are designed to assist surgeons during procedures, thereby reducing complications and enhancing patient care. Training machine learning models for these systems requires a large corpus of annotated datasets, which is challenging to obtain in the surgical domain due to patient privacy concerns and the significant labeling effort required from doctors. Previous methods have explored unpaired image translation using generative models to create realistic surgical images from simulations. However, these approaches have struggled to produce high-quality, diverse surgical images. In this work, we introduce \emph{SurgicaL-CD}, a consistency-distilled diffusion method to generate realistic surgical images with only a few sampling steps without paired data. We evaluate our approach on three datasets, assessing the generated images in terms of quality and utility as downstream training datasets. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms GANs and diffusion-based approaches. Our code is available at https://gitlab.com/nct_tso_public/gan2diffusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss evaluating video foundation models in a fair and robust manner. Unlike language or image foundation models, many video foundation models are evaluated with differing parameters (such as sampling rate, number of frames, pretraining steps, etc.), making fair and robust comparisons challenging. Therefore, we present a carefully designed evaluation framework for measuring two core capabilities of video comprehension: appearance and motion understanding. Our findings reveal that existing video foundation models, whether text-supervised like UMT or InternVideo2, or self-supervised like V-JEPA, exhibit limitations in at least one of these capabilities. As an alternative, we introduce TWLV-I, a new video foundation model that constructs robust visual representations for both motion- and appearance-based videos. Based on the average top-1 accuracy of linear probing on five action recognition benchmarks, pretrained only on publicly accessible datasets, our model shows a 4.6%p improvement compared to V-JEPA (ViT-L) and a 7.7%p improvement compared to UMT (ViT-L). Even when compared to much larger models, our model demonstrates a 7.2%p improvement compared to DFN (ViT-H), a 2.7%p improvement compared to V-JEPA (ViT-H) and a 2.8%p improvement compared to InternVideo2 (ViT-g). We provide embedding vectors obtained by TWLV-I from videos of several commonly used video benchmarks, along with evaluation source code that can directly utilize these embeddings. The code is available at https://github.com/twelvelabs-io/video-embeddings-evaluation-framework.</description>

Abstract: Fashion image editing aims to modify a person's appearance based on a given instruction. Existing methods require auxiliary tools like segmenters and keypoint extractors, lacking a flexible and unified framework. Moreover, these methods are limited in the variety of clothing types they can handle, as most datasets focus on people in clean backgrounds and only include generic garments such as tops, pants, and dresses. These limitations restrict their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we first extend an existing dataset for human generation to include a wider range of apparel and more complex backgrounds. This extended dataset features people wearing diverse items such as tops, pants, dresses, skirts, headwear, scarves, shoes, socks, and bags. Additionally, we propose AnyDesign, a diffusion-based method that enables mask-free editing on versatile areas. Users can simply input a human image along with a corresponding prompt in either text or image format. Our approach incorporates Fashion DiT, equipped with a Fashion-Guidance Attention (FGA) module designed to fuse explicit apparel types and CLIP-encoded apparel features. Both Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method delivers high-quality fashion editing and outperforms contemporary text-guided fashion editing methods.</description>

      <title>DH-Bench: Probing Depth and Height Perception of Large Visual-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometric understanding is crucial for navigating and interacting with our environment. While large Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, deploying them in real-world scenarios necessitates a comparable geometric understanding in visual perception. In this work, we focus on the geometric comprehension of these models; specifically targeting the depths and heights of objects within a scene. Our observations reveal that, although VLMs excel in basic geometric properties perception such as shape and size, they encounter significant challenges in reasoning about the depth and height of objects. To address this, we introduce a suite of benchmark datasets encompassing Synthetic 2D, Synthetic 3D, and Real-World scenarios to rigorously evaluate these aspects. We benchmark 17 state-of-the-art VLMs using these datasets and find that they consistently struggle with both depth and height perception. Our key insights include detailed analyses of the shortcomings in depth and height reasoning capabilities of VLMs and the inherent bias present in these models. This study aims to pave the way for the development of VLMs with enhanced geometric understanding, crucial for real-world applications. The code and datasets for our benchmarks will be available at \url{https://github.com/sacrcv/DH-Bench}.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Unstructured High-Density Crowded Scenes for Crowd Monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in developing an automated system for detection of organized movements in human crowds. Computer vision algorithms can extract information from videos of crowded scenes and automatically detect and track groups of individuals undergoing organized motion that represents an anomalous behavior in the context of conflict aversion. Our system can detect organized cohorts against the background of randomly moving objects and we can estimate the number of participants in an organized cohort, the speed and direction of motion in real time, within three to four video frames, which is less than one second from the onset of motion captured on a CCTV. We have performed preliminary analysis in this context in biological cell data containing up to four thousand objects per frame and will extend this numerically to a hundred-fold for public safety applications.
  We envisage using the existing infrastructure of video cameras for acquiring image datasets on-the-fly and deploying an easy-to-use data-driven software system for parsing of significant events by analyzing image sequences taken inside and outside of sports stadiums or other public venues. Other prospective users are organizers of political rallies, civic and wildlife organizations, security firms, and the military. We will optimize the performance of the software by implementing a classification method able to distinguish between activities posing a threat and those not posing a threat.</description>

      <title>SPARK: Multi-Vision Sensor Perception and Reasoning Benchmark for Large-scale Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced with text-aligned vision inputs. They have made remarkable progress in computer vision tasks by aligning text modality with vision inputs. There are also endeavors to incorporate multi-vision sensors beyond RGB, including thermal, depth, and medical X-ray images. However, we observe that current LVLMs view images taken from multi-vision sensors as if they were in the same RGB domain without considering the physical characteristics of multi-vision sensors. They fail to convey the fundamental multi-vision sensor information from the dataset and the corresponding contextual knowledge properly. Consequently, alignment between the information from the actual physical environment and the text is not achieved correctly, making it difficult to answer complex sensor-related questions that consider the physical environment. In this paper, we aim to establish a multi-vision Sensor Perception And Reasoning benchmarK called SPARK that can reduce the fundamental multi-vision sensor information gap between images and multi-vision sensors. We generated 6,248 vision-language test samples to investigate multi-vision sensory perception and multi-vision sensory reasoning on physical sensor knowledge proficiency across different formats, covering different types of sensor-related questions. We utilized these samples to assess ten leading LVLMs. The results showed that most models displayed deficiencies in multi-vision sensory reasoning to varying extents.

      <title>Transientangelo: Few-Viewpoint Surface Reconstruction Using Single-Photon Lidar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of few-viewpoint 3D surface reconstruction using raw measurements from a lidar system. Lidar captures 3D scene geometry by emitting pulses of light to a target and recording the speed-of-light time delay of the reflected light. However, conventional lidar systems do not output the raw, captured waveforms of backscattered light; instead, they pre-process these data into a 3D point cloud. Since this procedure typically does not accurately model the noise statistics of the system, exploit spatial priors, or incorporate information about downstream tasks, it ultimately discards useful information that is encoded in raw measurements of backscattered light. Here, we propose to leverage raw measurements captured with a single-photon lidar system from multiple viewpoints to optimize a neural surface representation of a scene. The measurements consist of time-resolved photon count histograms, or transients, which capture information about backscattered light at picosecond time scales. Additionally, we develop new regularization strategies that improve robustness to photon noise, enabling accurate surface reconstruction with as few as 10 photons per pixel. Our method outperforms other techniques for few-viewpoint 3D reconstruction based on depth maps, point clouds, or conventional lidar as demonstrated in simulation and with captured data.</description>

      <title>GarmentAligner: Text-to-Garment Generation via Retrieval-augmented Multi-level Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General text-to-image models bring revolutionary innovation to the fields of arts, design, and media. However, when applied to garment generation, even the state-of-the-art text-to-image models suffer from fine-grained semantic misalignment, particularly concerning the quantity, position, and interrelations of garment components. Addressing this, we propose GarmentAligner, a text-to-garment diffusion model trained with retrieval-augmented multi-level corrections. To achieve semantic alignment at the component level, we introduce an automatic component extraction pipeline to obtain spatial and quantitative information of garment components from corresponding images and captions. Subsequently, to exploit component relationships within the garment images, we construct retrieval subsets for each garment by retrieval augmentation based on component-level similarity ranking and conduct contrastive learning to enhance the model perception of components from positive and negative samples. To further enhance the alignment of components across semantic, spatial, and quantitative granularities, we propose the utilization of multi-level correction losses that leverage detailed component information. The experimental findings demonstrate that GarmentAligner achieves superior fidelity and fine-grained semantic alignment when compared to existing competitors.</description>

      <title>UMERegRobust -- Universal Manifold Embedding Compatible Features for Robust Point Cloud Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we adopt the Universal Manifold Embedding (UME) framework for the estimation of rigid transformations and extend it, so that it can accommodate scenarios involving partial overlap and differently sampled point clouds. UME is a methodology designed for mapping observations of the same object, related by rigid transformations, into a single low-dimensional linear subspace. This process yields a transformation-invariant representation of the observations, with its matrix form representation being covariant (i.e. equivariant) with the transformation. We extend the UME framework by introducing a UME-compatible feature extraction method augmented with a unique UME contrastive loss and a sampling equalizer. These components are integrated into a comprehensive and robust registration pipeline, named UMERegRobust. We propose the RotKITTI registration benchmark, specifically tailored to evaluate registration methods for scenarios involving large rotations. UMERegRobust achieves better than state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark, especially when strict precision of (1{\deg}, 10cm) is considered (with an average gain of +9%), and notably outperform SOTA methods on the RotKITTI benchmark (with +45% gain compared the most recent SOTA method).</description>

      <title>Diverse Part Synthesis for 3D Shape Creation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09384v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methods that use neural networks for synthesizing 3D shapes in the form of a part-based representation have been introduced over the last few years. These methods represent shapes as a graph or hierarchy of parts and enable a variety of applications such as shape sampling and reconstruction. However, current methods do not allow easily regenerating individual shape parts according to user preferences. In this paper, we investigate techniques that allow the user to generate multiple, diverse suggestions for individual parts. Specifically, we experiment with multimodal deep generative models that allow sampling diverse suggestions for shape parts and focus on models which have not been considered in previous work on shape synthesis. To provide a comparative study of these techniques, we introduce a method for synthesizing 3D shapes in a part-based representation and evaluate all the part suggestion techniques within this synthesis method. In our method, which is inspired by previous work, shapes are represented as a set of parts in the form of implicit functions which are then positioned in space to form the final shape. Synthesis in this representation is enabled by a neural network architecture based on an implicit decoder and a spatial transformer. We compare the various multimodal generative models by evaluating their performance in generating part suggestions. Our contribution is to show with qualitative and quantitative evaluations which of the new techniques for multimodal part generation perform the best and that a synthesis method based on the top-performing techniques allows the user to more finely control the parts that are generated in the 3D shapes while maintaining high shape fidelity when reconstructing shapes.</description>

      <title>etuner: A Redundancy-Aware Framework for Efficient Continual Learning Application on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16694v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many emerging applications, such as robot-assisted eldercare and object recognition, generally employ deep learning neural networks (DNNs) and require the deployment of DNN models on edge devices. These applications naturally require i) handling streaming-in inference requests and ii) fine-tuning the deployed models to adapt to possible deployment scenario changes. Continual learning (CL) is widely adopted to satisfy these needs. CL is a popular deep learning paradigm that handles both continuous model fine-tuning and overtime inference requests. However, an inappropriate model fine-tuning scheme could involve significant redundancy and consume considerable time and energy, making it challenging to apply CL on edge devices. In this paper, we propose ETuner, an efficient edge continual learning framework that optimizes inference accuracy, fine-tuning execution time, and energy efficiency through both inter-tuning and intra-tuning optimizations. Experimental results show that, on average, ETuner reduces overall fine-tuning execution time by 64%, energy consumption by 56%, and improves average inference accuracy by 1.75% over the immediate model fine-tuning approach.</description>

      <title>A Heterogeneous Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network for Image Super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks can automatically learn features via deep network architectures and given input samples. However, robustness of obtained models may have challenges in varying scenes. Bigger differences of a network architecture are beneficial to extract more complementary structural information to enhance robustness of an obtained super-resolution model. In this paper, we present a heterogeneous dynamic convolutional network in image super-resolution (HDSRNet). To capture more information, HDSRNet is implemented by a heterogeneous parallel network. The upper network can facilitate more contexture information via stacked heterogeneous blocks to improve effects of image super-resolution. Each heterogeneous block is composed of a combination of a dilated, dynamic, common convolutional layers, ReLU and residual learning operation. It can not only adaptively adjust parameters, according to different inputs, but also prevent long-term dependency problem. The lower network utilizes a symmetric architecture to enhance relations of different layers to mine more structural information, which is complementary with a upper network for image super-resolution. The relevant experimental results show that the proposed HDSRNet is effective to deal with image resolving. The code of HDSRNet can be obtained at https://github.com/hellloxiaotian/HDSRNet.</description>

      <title>Low-light phase retrieval with implicit generative priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase retrieval (PR) is fundamentally important in scientific imaging and is crucial for nanoscale techniques like coherent diffractive imaging (CDI). Low radiation dose imaging is essential for applications involving radiation-sensitive samples. However, most PR methods struggle in low-dose scenarios due to high shot noise. Recent advancements in optical data acquisition setups, such as in-situ CDI, have shown promise for low-dose imaging, but they rely on a time series of measurements, making them unsuitable for single-image applications. Similarly, data-driven phase retrieval techniques are not easily adaptable to data-scarce situations. Zero-shot deep learning methods based on pre-trained and implicit generative priors have been effective in various imaging tasks but have shown limited success in PR. In this work, we propose low-dose deep image prior (LoDIP), which combines in-situ CDI with the power of implicit generative priors to address single-image low-dose phase retrieval. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate LoDIP's superior performance in this task and its applicability to real experimental scenarios.</description>

      <title>RSTAR: Rotational Streak Artifact Reduction in 4D CBCT using Separable and Circular Convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Four-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography (4D CBCT) provides respiration-resolved images and can be used for image-guided radiation therapy. However, the ability to reveal respiratory motion comes at the cost of image artifacts. As raw projection data are sorted into multiple respiratory phases, the cone-beam projections become much sparser and the reconstructed 4D CBCT images will be covered by severe streak artifacts. Although several deep learning-based methods have been proposed to address this issue, most algorithms employ 2D network models as backbones, neglecting the intrinsic structural priors within 4D CBCT images. In this paper, we first explore the origin and appearance of streak artifacts in 4D CBCT images. We find that streak artifacts exhibit a unique rotational motion along with the patient's respiration, distinguishable from diaphragm-driven respiratory motion in the spatiotemporal domain. Therefore, we propose a novel 4D neural network model, RSTAR4D-Net, designed to address Rotational STreak Artifact Reduction by integrating the spatial and temporal information within 4D CBCT images. Specifically, we overcome the computational and training difficulties of a 4D neural network. The specially designed model adopts an efficient implementation of 4D convolutions to reduce computational costs and thus can process the whole 4D image in one pass. Additionally, a Tetris training strategy pertinent to the separable 4D convolutions is proposed to effectively train the model using limited 4D training samples. Extensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and the RSTAR4D-Net shows superior performance compared to other methods. The source code and dynamic demos are available at https://github.com/ivy9092111111/RSTAR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation with two-finger grippers is challenged by objects lacking distinct graspable features. Traditional pre-grasping methods, which typically involve repositioning objects or utilizing external aids like table edges, are limited in their adaptability across different object categories and environments. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PreAfford, a novel pre-grasping planning framework incorporating a point-level affordance representation and a relay training approach. Our method significantly improves adaptability, allowing effective manipulation across a wide range of environments and object types. When evaluated on the ShapeNet-v2 dataset, PreAfford not only enhances grasping success rates by 69% but also demonstrates its practicality through successful real-world experiments. These improvements highlight PreAfford's potential to redefine standards for robotic handling of complex manipulation tasks in diverse settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is pivotal in various medical diagnoses due to its non-invasive nature and safety. In clinical practice, the accuracy and precision of ultrasound image analysis are critical. Recent advancements in deep learning are showing great capacity of processing medical images. However, the data hungry nature of deep learning and the shortage of high-quality ultrasound image training data suppress the development of deep learning based ultrasound analysis methods. To address these challenges, we introduce an advanced deep learning model, dubbed S-CycleGAN, which generates high-quality synthetic ultrasound images from computed tomography (CT) data. This model incorporates semantic discriminators within a CycleGAN framework to ensure that critical anatomical details are preserved during the style transfer process. The synthetic images are utilized to enhance various aspects of our development of the robot-assisted ultrasound scanning system. The data and code will be available at https://github.com/yhsong98/ct-us-i2i-translation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-inspired Generative Models (GMs), in particular Diffusion Models (DMs) and Poisson Flow Models (PFMs), enhance Bayesian methods and promise great utility in medical imaging. This review examines the transformative role of such generative methods. First, a variety of physics-inspired GMs, including Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), Score-based Diffusion Models (SDMs), and Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGMs and PFGM++), are revisited, with an emphasis on their accuracy, robustness as well as acceleration. Then, major applications of physics-inspired GMs in medical imaging are presented, comprising image reconstruction, image generation, and image analysis. Finally, future research directions are brainstormed, including unification of physics-inspired GMs, integration with Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and potential novel applications of GMs. Since the development of generative methods has been rapid, this review will hopefully give peers and learners a timely snapshot of this new family of physics-driven generative models and help capitalize their enormous potential for medical imaging.</description>

Abstract: Attention based models have achieved many remarkable breakthroughs in numerous applications. However, the quadratic complexity of Attention makes the vanilla Attention based models hard to apply to long sequence tasks. Various improved Attention structures are proposed to reduce the computation cost by inducing low rankness and approximating the whole sequence by sub-sequences. The most challenging part of those approaches is maintaining the proper balance between information preservation and computation reduction: the longer sub-sequences used, the better information is preserved, but at the price of introducing more noise and computational costs. In this paper, we propose a smoothed skeleton sketching based Attention structure, coined S$^3$Attention, which significantly improves upon the previous attempts to negotiate this trade-off. S$^3$Attention has two mechanisms to effectively minimize the impact of noise while keeping the linear complexity to the sequence length: a smoothing block to mix information over long sequences and a matrix sketching method that simultaneously selects columns and rows from the input matrix. We verify the effectiveness of S$^3$Attention both theoretically and empirically. Extensive studies over Long Range Arena (LRA) datasets and six time-series forecasting show that S$^3$Attention significantly outperforms both vanilla Attention and other state-of-the-art variants of Attention structures.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the theoretical foundations of classifier-free guidance (CFG). CFG is the dominant method of conditional sampling for text-to-image diffusion models, yet unlike other aspects of diffusion, it remains on shaky theoretical footing. In this paper, we disprove common misconceptions, by showing that CFG interacts differently with DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) and DDIM (Song et al., 2021), and neither sampler with CFG generates the gamma-powered distribution $p(x|c)^\gamma p(x)^{1-\gamma}$. Then, we clarify the behavior of CFG by showing that it is a kind of predictor-corrector method (Song et al., 2020) that alternates between denoising and sharpening, which we call predictor-corrector guidance (PCG). We prove that in the SDE limit, CFG is actually equivalent to combining a DDIM predictor for the conditional distribution together with a Langevin dynamics corrector for a gamma-powered distribution (with a carefully chosen gamma). Our work thus provides a lens to theoretically understand CFG by embedding it in a broader design space of principled sampling methods.</description>
