      <title>Cross-table Synthetic Tabular Data Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting synthetic tabular data is essential to prevent the distribution of false or manipulated datasets that could compromise data-driven decision-making. This study explores whether synthetic tabular data can be reliably identified ''in the wild''-meaning across different generators, domains, and table formats. This challenge is unique to tabular data, where structures (such as number of columns, data types, and formats) can vary widely from one table to another. We propose three cross-table baseline detectors and four distinct evaluation protocols, each corresponding to a different level of ''wildness''. Our very preliminary results confirm that cross-table adaptation is a challenging task.</description>

      <title>Training Verification-Friendly Neural Networks via Neuron Behavior Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal verification provides critical security assurances for neural networks, yet its practical application suffers from the long verification time. This work introduces a novel method for training verification-friendly neural networks, which are robust, easy to verify, and relatively accurate. Our method integrates neuron behavior consistency into the training process, making neuron activation states consistent across different inputs in a local neighborhood, reducing the number of unstable neurons and tightening the bounds of neurons thereby enhancing neural network verifiability. We evaluated our method using the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets across various network architectures. The results of the experiment demonstrate that networks trained using our method are verification-friendly across different radii and different model architectures, whereas other tools fail to maintain verifiability as the radius increases. We also show that our method can be combined with existing methods to further improve the verifiability of networks.</description>

      <title>Content-aware Balanced Spectrum Encoding in Masked Modeling for Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the superior ability of global dependency, transformer and its variants have become the primary choice in Masked Time-series Modeling (MTM) towards time-series classification task. In this paper, we experimentally analyze that existing transformer-based MTM methods encounter with two under-explored issues when dealing with time series data: (1) they encode features by performing long-dependency ensemble averaging, which easily results in rank collapse and feature homogenization as the layer goes deeper; (2) they exhibit distinct priorities in fitting different frequency components contained in the time-series, inevitably leading to spectrum energy imbalance of encoded feature. To tackle these issues, we propose an auxiliary content-aware balanced decoder (CBD) to optimize the encoding quality in the spectrum space within masked modeling scheme. Specifically, the CBD iterates on a series of fundamental blocks, and thanks to two tailored units, each block could progressively refine the masked representation via adjusting the interaction pattern based on local content variations of time-series and learning to recalibrate the energy distribution across different frequency components. Moreover, a dual-constraint loss is devised to enhance the mutual optimization of vanilla decoder and our CBD. Extensive experimental results on ten time-series classification datasets show that our method nearly surpasses a bunch of baselines. Meanwhile, a series of explanatory results are showcased to sufficiently demystify the behaviors of our method.</description>

      <title>COSEE: Consistency-Oriented Signal-Based Early Exiting via Calibrated Sample Weighting Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early exiting is an effective paradigm for improving the inference efficiency of pre-trained language models (PLMs) by dynamically adjusting the number of executed layers for each sample. However, in most existing works, easy and hard samples are treated equally by each classifier during training, which neglects the test-time early exiting behavior, leading to inconsistency between training and testing. Although some methods have tackled this issue under a fixed speed-up ratio, the challenge of flexibly adjusting the speed-up ratio while maintaining consistency between training and testing is still under-explored. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel Consistency-Oriented Signal-based Early Exiting (COSEE) framework, which leverages a calibrated sample weighting mechanism to enable each classifier to emphasize the samples that are more likely to exit at that classifier under various acceleration scenarios. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our COSEE across multiple exiting signals and backbones, yielding a better trade-off between performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Internet of Things Security throughSelf-Supervised Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), ensuring the security of IoT devices has become essential. One of the primary challenges in this field is that new types of attacks often have significantly fewer samples than more common attacks, leading to unbalanced datasets. Existing research on detecting intrusions in these unbalanced labeled datasets primarily employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or conventional Machine Learning (ML) models, which result in incomplete detection, especially for new attacks. To handle these challenges, we suggest a new approach to IoT intrusion detection using Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) with a Markov Graph Convolutional Network (MarkovGCN). Graph learning excels at modeling complex relationships within data, while SSL mitigates the issue of limited labeled data for emerging attacks. Our approach leverages the inherent structure of IoT networks to pre-train a GCN, which is then fine-tuned for the intrusion detection task. The integration of Markov chains in GCN uncovers network structures and enriches node and edge features with contextual information. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves detection accuracy and robustness compared to conventional supervised learning methods. Using the EdgeIIoT-set dataset, we attained an accuracy of 98.68\%, a precision of 98.18%, a recall of 98.35%, and an F1-Score of 98.40%.</description>

      <title>GPgym: A Remote Service Platform with Gaussian Process Regression for Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is now widely applied across various domains, including industry, engineering, and research. While numerous mature machine learning models have been open-sourced on platforms like GitHub, their deployment often requires writing scripts in specific programming languages, such as Python, C++, or MATLAB. This dependency on particular languages creates a barrier for professionals outside the field of machine learning, making it challenging to integrate these algorithms into their workflows. To address this limitation, we propose GPgym, a remote service node based on Gaussian process regression. GPgym enables experts from diverse fields to seamlessly and flexibly incorporate machine learning techniques into their existing specialized software, without needing to write or manage complex script code.</description>

      <title>Posterior Mean Matching: Generative Modeling through Online Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces posterior mean matching (PMM), a new method for generative modeling that is grounded in Bayesian inference. PMM uses conjugate pairs of distributions to model complex data of various modalities like images and text, offering a flexible alternative to existing methods like diffusion models. PMM models iteratively refine noisy approximations of the target distribution using updates from online Bayesian inference. PMM is flexible because its mechanics are based on general Bayesian models. We demonstrate this flexibility by developing specialized examples: a generative PMM model of real-valued data using the Normal-Normal model, a generative PMM model of count data using a Gamma-Poisson model, and a generative PMM model of discrete data using a Dirichlet-Categorical model. For the Normal-Normal PMM model, we establish a direct connection to diffusion models by showing that its continuous-time formulation converges to a stochastic differential equation (SDE). Additionally, for the Gamma-Poisson PMM, we derive a novel SDE driven by a Cox process, which is a significant departure from traditional Brownian motion-based generative models. PMMs achieve performance that is competitive with generative models for language modeling and image generation.</description>

      <title>Automated Phytosensing: Ozone Exposure Classification Based on Plant Electrical Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our project WatchPlant, we propose to use a decentralized network of living plants as air-quality sensors by measuring their electrophysiology to infer the environmental state, also called phytosensing. We conducted in-lab experiments exposing ivy (Hedera helix) plants to ozone, an important pollutant to monitor, and measured their electrophysiological response. However, there is no well established automated way of detecting ozone exposure in plants. We propose a generic automatic toolchain to select a high-performance subset of features and highly accurate models for plant electrophysiology. Our approach derives plant- and stimulus-generic features from the electrophysiological signal using the tsfresh library. Based on these features, we automatically select and optimize machine learning models using AutoML. We use forward feature selection to increase model performance. We show that our approach successfully classifies plant ozone exposure with accuracies of up to 94.6% on unseen data. We also show that our approach can be used for other plant species and stimuli. Our toolchain automates the development of monitoring algorithms for plants as pollutant monitors. Our results help implement significant advancements for phytosensing devices contributing to the development of cost-effective, high-density urban air monitoring systems in the future.</description>

      <title>LossLens: Diagnostics for Machine Learning through Loss Landscape Visual Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning often relies on optimizing a neural network's parameters using a loss function to learn complex features. Beyond training, examining the loss function with respect to a network's parameters (i.e., as a loss landscape) can reveal insights into the architecture and learning process. While the local structure of the loss landscape surrounding an individual solution can be characterized using a variety of approaches, the global structure of a loss landscape, which includes potentially many local minima corresponding to different solutions, remains far more difficult to conceptualize and visualize. To address this difficulty, we introduce LossLens, a visual analytics framework that explores loss landscapes at multiple scales. LossLens integrates metrics from global and local scales into a comprehensive visual representation, enhancing model diagnostics. We demonstrate LossLens through two case studies: visualizing how residual connections influence a ResNet-20, and visualizing how physical parameters influence a physics-informed neural network (PINN) solving a simple convection problem.</description>

      <title>Beyond Accuracy: On the Effects of Fine-tuning Towards Vision-Language Model's Prediction Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have already seen widespread applications. Researchers actively engage in further fine-tuning VLMs in safety-critical domains. In these domains, prediction rationality is crucial: the prediction should be correct and based on valid evidence. Yet, for VLMs, the impact of fine-tuning on prediction rationality is seldomly investigated. To study this problem, we proposed two new metrics called Prediction Trustworthiness and Inference Reliability. We conducted extensive experiments on various settings and observed some interesting phenomena. On the one hand, we found that the well-adopted fine-tuning methods led to more correct predictions based on invalid evidence. This potentially undermines the trustworthiness of correct predictions from fine-tuned VLMs. On the other hand, having identified valid evidence of target objects, fine-tuned VLMs were more likely to make correct predictions. Moreover, the findings are also consistent under distributional shifts and across various experimental settings. We hope our research offer fresh insights to VLM fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Secret Recipe: A Guide For Supervised Fine-Tuning Small LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created a significant disparity: industrial research labs with their computational resources, expert teams, and advanced infrastructures, can effectively fine-tune LLMs, while individual developers and small organizations face barriers due to limited resources. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by presenting a comprehensive study on supervised fine-tuning of LLMs using instruction-tuning datasets spanning diverse knowledge domains and skills. We focus on small-sized LLMs (3B to 7B parameters) for their cost-efficiency and accessibility. We explore various training configurations and strategies across four open-source pre-trained models. We provide detailed documentation of these configurations, revealing findings that challenge several common training practices, including hyperparameter recommendations from TULU and phased training recommended by Orca. Key insights from our work include: (i) larger batch sizes paired with lower learning rates lead to improved model performance on benchmarks such as MMLU, MTBench, and Open LLM Leaderboard; (ii) early-stage training dynamics, such as lower gradient norms and higher loss values, are strong indicators of better final model performance, enabling early termination of sub-optimal runs and significant computational savings; (iii) through a thorough exploration of hyperparameters like warmup steps and learning rate schedules, we provide guidance for practitioners and find that certain simplifications do not compromise performance; and (iv) we observed no significant difference in performance between phased and stacked training strategies, but stacked training is simpler and more sample efficient. With these findings holding robustly across datasets and models, we hope this study serves as a guide for practitioners fine-tuning small LLMs and promotes a more inclusive environment for LLM research.</description>

      <title>Concept-ROT: Poisoning Concepts in Large Language Models with Model Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model editing methods modify specific behaviors of Large Language Models by altering a small, targeted set of network weights and require very little data and compute. These methods can be used for malicious applications such as inserting misinformation or simple trojans that result in adversary-specified behaviors when a trigger word is present. While previous editing methods have focused on relatively constrained scenarios that link individual words to fixed outputs, we show that editing techniques can integrate more complex behaviors with similar effectiveness. We develop Concept-ROT, a model editing-based method that efficiently inserts trojans which not only exhibit complex output behaviors, but also trigger on high-level concepts -- presenting an entirely new class of trojan attacks. Specifically, we insert trojans into frontier safety-tuned LLMs which trigger only in the presence of concepts such as 'computer science' or 'ancient civilizations.' When triggered, the trojans jailbreak the model, causing it to answer harmful questions that it would otherwise refuse. Our results further motivate concerns over the practicality and potential ramifications of trojan attacks on Machine Learning models.</description>

      <title>A Novel Machine Learning Classifier Based on Genetic Algorithms and Data Importance Reformatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel classification algorithm that is based on Data Importance (DI) reformatting and Genetic Algorithms (GA) named GADIC is proposed to overcome the issues related to the nature of data which may hinder the performance of the Machine Learning (ML) classifiers. GADIC comprises three phases which are data reformatting phase which depends on DI concept, training phase where GA is applied on the reformatted training dataset, and testing phase where the instances of the reformatted testing dataset are being averaged based on similar instances in the training dataset. GADIC is an approach that utilizes the exiting ML classifiers with involvement of data reformatting, using GA to tune the inputs, and averaging the similar instances to the unknown instance. The averaging of the instances becomes the unknown instance to be classified in the stage of testing. GADIC has been tested on five existing ML classifiers which are Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), and Na\"ive Bayes (NB). All were evaluated using seven open-source UCI ML repository and Kaggle datasets which are Cleveland heart disease, Indian liver patient, Pima Indian diabetes, employee future prediction, telecom churn prediction, bank customer churn, and tech students. In terms of accuracy, the results showed that, with the exception of approximately 1% decrease in the accuracy of NB classifier in Cleveland heart disease dataset, GADIC significantly enhanced the performance of most ML classifiers using various datasets. In addition, KNN with GADIC showed the greatest performance gain when compared with other ML classifiers with GADIC followed by SVM while LR had the lowest improvement. The lowest average improvement that GADIC could achieve is 5.96%, whereas the maximum average improvement reached 16.79%.</description>

      <title>Wind Speed Forecasting Based on Data Decomposition and Deep Learning Models: A Case Study of a Wind Farm in Saudi Arabia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With industrial and technological development and the increasing demand for electric power, wind energy has gradually become the fastest-growing and most environmentally friendly new energy source. Nevertheless, wind power generation is always accompanied by uncertainty due to the wind speed's volatility. Wind speed forecasting (WSF) is essential for power grids' dispatch, stability, and controllability, and its accuracy is crucial to effectively using wind resources. Therefore, this study proposes a novel WSF framework for stationary data based on a hybrid decomposition method and the Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory (BiLSTM) to achieve high forecasting accuracy for the Dumat Al-Jandal wind farm in Al-Jouf, Saudi Arabia. The hybrid decomposition method combines the Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) and the Seasonal Adjustment Method (SAM). The SAM method eliminates the seasonal component of the decomposed subseries generated by WPD to reduce forecasting complexity. The BiLSTM is applied to forecast all the deseasonalized decomposed subseries. Five years of hourly wind speed observations acquired from a location in the Al-Jouf region were used to prove the effectiveness of the proposed model. The comparative experimental results, including 27 other models, demonstrated the proposed model's superiority in single and multiple WSF with an overall average mean absolute error of 0.176549, root mean square error of 0.247069, and R-squared error of 0.985987.</description>

      <title>Rare Event Detection in Imbalanced Multi-Class Datasets Using an Optimal MIP-Based Ensemble Weighting Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the challenges of imbalanced multi-class datasets typically used for rare event detection in critical cyber-physical systems, we propose an optimal, efficient, and adaptable mixed integer programming (MIP) ensemble weighting scheme. Our approach leverages the diverse capabilities of the classifier ensemble on a granular per class basis, while optimizing the weights of classifier-class pairs using elastic net regularization for improved robustness and generalization. Additionally, it seamlessly and optimally selects a predefined number of classifiers from a given set. We evaluate and compare our MIP-based method against six well-established weighting schemes, using representative datasets and suitable metrics, under various ensemble sizes. The experimental results reveal that MIP outperforms all existing approaches, achieving an improvement in balanced accuracy ranging from 0.99% to 7.31%, with an overall average of 4.53% across all datasets and ensemble sizes. Furthermore, it attains an overall average increase of 4.63%, 4.60%, and 4.61% in macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively, while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Personalized Federal Graph Learning via Low-Rank Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) has gained significant attention for enabling heterogeneous clients to process their private graph data locally while interacting with a centralized server, thus maintaining privacy. However, graph data on clients are typically non-IID, posing a challenge for a single model to perform well across all clients. Another major bottleneck of FGL is the high cost of communication. To address these challenges, we propose a communication-efficient personalized federated graph learning algorithm, CEFGL. Our method decomposes the model parameters into low-rank generic and sparse private models. We employ a dual-channel encoder to learn sparse local knowledge in a personalized manner and low-rank global knowledge in a shared manner. Additionally, we perform multiple local stochastic gradient descent iterations between communication phases and integrate efficient compression techniques into the algorithm. The advantage of CEFGL lies in its ability to capture common and individual knowledge more precisely. By utilizing low-rank and sparse parameters along with compression techniques, CEFGL significantly reduces communication complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves optimal classification accuracy in a variety of heterogeneous environments across sixteen datasets. Specifically, compared to the state-of-the-art method FedStar, the proposed method (with GIN as the base model) improves accuracy by 5.64\% on cross-datasets setting CHEM, reduces communication bits by a factor of 18.58, and reduces the communication time by a factor of 1.65.</description>

      <title>Federated Unlearning Model Recovery in Data with Skewed Label Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In federated learning, federated unlearning is a technique that provides clients with a rollback mechanism that allows them to withdraw their data contribution without training from scratch. However, existing research has not considered scenarios with skewed label distributions. Unfortunately, the unlearning of a client with skewed data usually results in biased models and makes it difficult to deliver high-quality service, complicating the recovery process. This paper proposes a recovery method of federated unlearning with skewed label distributions. Specifically, we first adopt a strategy that incorporates oversampling with deep learning to supplement the skewed class data for clients to perform recovery training, therefore enhancing the completeness of their local datasets. Afterward, a density-based denoising method is applied to remove noise from the generated data, further improving the quality of the remaining clients' datasets. Finally, all the remaining clients leverage the enhanced local datasets and engage in iterative training to effectively restore the performance of the unlearning model. Extensive evaluations on commonly used federated learning datasets with varying degrees of skewness show that our method outperforms baseline methods in restoring the performance of the unlearning model, particularly regarding accuracy on the skewed class.</description>

      <title>Efficient Fine-Tuning of Single-Cell Foundation Models Enables Zero-Shot Molecular Perturbation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting transcriptional responses to novel drugs provides a unique opportunity to accelerate biomedical research and advance drug discovery efforts. However, the inherent complexity and high dimensionality of cellular responses, combined with the extremely limited available experimental data, makes the task challenging. In this study, we leverage single-cell foundation models (FMs) pre-trained on tens of millions of single cells, encompassing multiple cell types, states, and disease annotations, to address molecular perturbation prediction. We introduce a drug-conditional adapter that allows efficient fine-tuning by training less than 1% of the original foundation model, thus enabling molecular conditioning while preserving the rich biological representation learned during pre-training. The proposed strategy allows not only the prediction of cellular responses to novel drugs, but also the zero-shot generalization to unseen cell lines. We establish a robust evaluation framework to assess model performance across different generalization tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results across all settings, with significant improvements in the few-shot and zero-shot generalization to new cell lines compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Federated t-SNE and UMAP for Distributed Data Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional data visualization is crucial in the big data era and these techniques such as t-SNE and UMAP have been widely used in science and engineering. Big data, however, is often distributed across multiple data centers and subject to security and privacy concerns, which leads to difficulties for the standard algorithms of t-SNE and UMAP. To tackle the challenge, this work proposes Fed-tSNE and Fed-UMAP, which provide high-dimensional data visualization under the framework of federated learning, without exchanging data across clients or sending data to the central server. The main idea of Fed-tSNE and Fed-UMAP is implicitly learning the distribution information of data in a manner of federated learning and then estimating the global distance matrix for t-SNE and UMAP. To further enhance the protection of data privacy, we propose Fed-tSNE+ and Fed-UMAP+. We also extend our idea to federated spectral clustering, yielding algorithms of clustering distributed data. In addition to these new algorithms, we offer theoretical guarantees of optimization convergence, distance and similarity estimation, and differential privacy. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that, compared to the original algorithms, the accuracy drops of our federated algorithms are tiny.</description>

      <title>Learning Causal Transition Matrix for Instance-dependent Label Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noisy labels are both inevitable and problematic in machine learning methods, as they negatively impact models' generalization ability by causing overfitting. In the context of learning with noise, the transition matrix plays a crucial role in the design of statistically consistent algorithms. However, the transition matrix is often considered unidentifiable. One strand of methods typically addresses this problem by assuming that the transition matrix is instance-independent; that is, the probability of mislabeling a particular instance is not influenced by its characteristics or attributes. This assumption is clearly invalid in complex real-world scenarios. To better understand the transition relationship and relax this assumption, we propose to study the data generation process of noisy labels from a causal perspective. We discover that an unobservable latent variable can affect either the instance itself, the label annotation procedure, or both, which complicates the identification of the transition matrix. To address various scenarios, we have unified these observations within a new causal graph. In this graph, the input instance is divided into a noise-resistant component and a noise-sensitive component based on whether they are affected by the latent variable. These two components contribute to identifying the ``causal transition matrix'', which approximates the true transition matrix with theoretical guarantee. In line with this, we have designed a novel training framework that explicitly models this causal relationship and, as a result, achieves a more accurate model for inferring the clean label.</description>

      <title>Open-Source Protein Language Models for Function Prediction and Protein Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have shown promise in improving the understanding of protein sequences, contributing to advances in areas such as function prediction and protein engineering. However, training these models from scratch requires significant computational resources, limiting their accessibility. To address this, we integrate a PLM into DeepChem, an open-source framework for computational biology and chemistry, to provide a more accessible platform for protein-related tasks.
  We evaluate the performance of the integrated model on various protein prediction tasks, showing that it achieves reasonable results across benchmarks. Additionally, we present an exploration of generating plastic-degrading enzyme candidates using the model's embeddings and latent space manipulation techniques. While the results suggest that further refinement is needed, this approach provides a foundation for future work in enzyme design. This study aims to facilitate the use of PLMs in research fields like synthetic biology and environmental sustainability, even for those with limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>Rethink the Evaluation Protocol of Model Merging on Classification Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned models into a single one via parameter fusion, achieving improvements across many tasks. However, in the classification task, we find a misalignment issue between merging outputs and the fine-tuned classifier, which limits its effectiveness. In this paper, we demonstrate the following observations: (1) The embedding quality of the merging outputs is already very high, and the primary reason for the differences in classification performance lies in the misalignment issue. (2) We propose FT-Classifier, a new protocol that fine-tunes an aligned classifier with few-shot samples to alleviate misalignment, enabling better evaluation of merging outputs and improved classification performance. (3) The misalignment is relatively straightforward and can be formulated as an orthogonal transformation. Experiments demonstrate the existence of misalignment and the effectiveness of our FT-Classifier evaluation protocol.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning in Log-based Anomaly Detection: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Log-based anomaly detection (LogAD) is the main component of Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps), which can detect anomalous that occur during the system on-the-fly. Existing methods commonly extract log sequence features using classical machine learning techniques to identify whether a new sequence is an anomaly or not. However, these classical approaches often require trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy. The advent of quantum machine learning (QML) offers a promising alternative. By transforming parts of classical machine learning computations into parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), QML can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters while maintaining accuracy comparable to classical counterparts. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, \ourframework{}, for evaluating QML models in the context of LogAD. This framework incorporates diverse log data, integrated QML models, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. State-of-the-art methods such as DeepLog, LogAnomaly, and LogRobust, along with their quantum-transformed counterparts, are included in our framework.Beyond standard metrics like F1 score, precision, and recall, our evaluation extends to factors critical to QML performance, such as specificity, the number of circuits, circuit design, and quantum state encoding. Using \ourframework{}, we conduct extensive experiments to assess the performance of these models and their quantum counterparts, uncovering valuable insights and paving the way for future research in QML model selection and design for LogAD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present {\em generative clustering} (GC) for clustering a set of documents, $\mathrm{X}$, by using texts $\mathrm{Y}$ generated by large language models (LLMs) instead of by clustering the original documents $\mathrm{X}$. Because LLMs provide probability distributions, the similarity between two documents can be rigorously defined in an information-theoretic manner by the KL divergence. We also propose a natural, novel clustering algorithm by using importance sampling. We show that GC achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming any previous clustering method often by a large margin. Furthermore, we show an application to generative document retrieval in which documents are indexed via hierarchical clustering and our method improves the retrieval accuracy.</description>

      <title>Multi-view Granular-ball Contrastive Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous multi-view contrastive learning methods typically operate at two scales: instance-level and cluster-level. Instance-level approaches construct positive and negative pairs based on sample correspondences, aiming to bring positive pairs closer and push negative pairs further apart in the latent space. Cluster-level methods focus on calculating cluster assignments for samples under each view and maximize view consensus by reducing distribution discrepancies, e.g., minimizing KL divergence or maximizing mutual information. However, these two types of methods either introduce false negatives, leading to reduced model discriminability, or overlook local structures and cannot measure relationships between clusters across views explicitly. To this end, we propose a method named Multi-view Granular-ball Contrastive Clustering (MGBCC). MGBCC segments the sample set into coarse-grained granular balls, and establishes associations between intra-view and cross-view granular balls. These associations are reinforced in a shared latent space, thereby achieving multi-granularity contrastive learning. Granular balls lie between instances and clusters, naturally preserving the local topological structure of the sample set. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Indirect Query Bayesian Optimization with Integrated Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the framework of Indirect Query Bayesian Optimization (IQBO), a new class of Bayesian optimization problems where the integrated feedback is given via a conditional expectation of the unknown function $f$ to be optimized. The underlying conditional distribution can be unknown and learned from data. The goal is to find the global optimum of $f$ by adaptively querying and observing in the space transformed by the conditional distribution. This is motivated by real-world applications where one cannot access direct feedback due to privacy, hardware or computational constraints. We propose the Conditional Max-Value Entropy Search (CMES) acquisition function to address this novel setting, and propose a hierarchical search algorithm to address the multi-resolution setting and improve the computational efficiency. We show regret bounds for our proposed methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on simulated optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>PowerMLP: An Efficient Version of KAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is a new network architecture known for its high accuracy in several tasks such as function fitting and PDE solving. The superior expressive capability of KAN arises from the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem and learnable spline functions. However, the computation of spline functions involves multiple iterations, which renders KAN significantly slower than MLP, thereby increasing the cost associated with model training and deployment. The authors of KAN have also noted that ``the biggest bottleneck of KANs lies in its slow training. KANs are usually 10x slower than MLPs, given the same number of parameters.'' To address this issue, we propose a novel MLP-type neural network PowerMLP that employs simpler non-iterative spline function representation, offering approximately the same training time as MLP while theoretically demonstrating stronger expressive power than KAN. Furthermore, we compare the FLOPs of KAN and PowerMLP, quantifying the faster computation speed of PowerMLP. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PowerMLP generally achieves higher accuracy and a training speed about 40 times faster than KAN in various tasks.</description>

      <title>SemiDFL: A Semi-Supervised Paradigm for Decentralized Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) realizes cooperative model training among connected clients without relying on a central server, thereby mitigating communication bottlenecks and eliminating the single-point failure issue present in centralized federated learning (CFL). Most existing work on DFL focuses on supervised learning, assuming each client possesses sufficient labeled data for local training. However, in real-world applications, much of the data is unlabeled. We address this by considering a challenging yet practical semisupervised learning (SSL) scenario in DFL, where clients may have varying data sources: some with few labeled samples, some with purely unlabeled data, and others with both. In this work, we propose SemiDFL, the first semi-supervised DFL method that enhances DFL performance in SSL scenarios by establishing a consensus in both data and model spaces. Specifically, we utilize neighborhood information to improve the quality of pseudo-labeling, which is crucial for effectively leveraging unlabeled data. We then design a consensusbased diffusion model to generate synthesized data, which is used in combination with pseudo-labeled data to create mixed datasets. Additionally, we develop an adaptive aggregation method that leverages the model accuracy of synthesized data to further enhance SemiDFL performance. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the remarkable performance superiority of the proposed DFL-Semi method over existing CFL and DFL schemes in both IID and non-IID SSL scenarios.</description>

      <title>PASCO (PArallel Structured COarsening): an overlay to speed up graph clustering algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering the nodes of a graph is a cornerstone of graph analysis and has been extensively studied. However, some popular methods are not suitable for very large graphs: e.g., spectral clustering requires the computation of the spectral decomposition of the Laplacian matrix, which is not applicable for large graphs with a large number of communities. This work introduces PASCO, an overlay that accelerates clustering algorithms. Our method consists of three steps: 1-We compute several independent small graphs representing the input graph by applying an efficient and structure-preserving coarsening algorithm. 2-A clustering algorithm is run in parallel onto each small graph and provides several partitions of the initial graph. 3-These partitions are aligned and combined with an optimal transport method to output the final partition. The PASCO framework is based on two key contributions: a novel global algorithm structure designed to enable parallelization and a fast, empirically validated graph coarsening algorithm that preserves structural properties. We demonstrate the strong performance of 1 PASCO in terms of computational efficiency, structural preservation, and output partition quality, evaluated on both synthetic and real-world graph datasets.</description>

      <title>PreMixer: MLP-Based Pre-training Enhanced MLP-Mixers for Large-scale Traffic Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In urban computing, precise and swift forecasting of multivariate time series data from traffic networks is crucial. This data incorporates additional spatial contexts such as sensor placements and road network layouts, and exhibits complex temporal patterns that amplify challenges for predictive learning in traffic management, smart mobility demand, and urban planning. Consequently, there is an increasing need to forecast traffic flow across broader geographic regions and for higher temporal coverage. However, current research encounters limitations because of the inherent inefficiency of model and their unsuitability for large-scale traffic network applications due to model complexity. This paper proposes a novel framework, named PreMixer, designed to bridge this gap. It features a predictive model and a pre-training mechanism, both based on the principles of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). The PreMixer comprehensively consider temporal dependencies of traffic patterns in different time windows and processes the spatial dynamics as well. Additionally, we integrate spatio-temporal positional encoding to manage spatiotemporal heterogeneity without relying on predefined graphs. Furthermore, our innovative pre-training model uses a simple patch-wise MLP to conduct masked time series modeling, learning from long-term historical data segmented into patches to generate enriched contextual representations. This approach enhances the downstream forecasting model without incurring significant time consumption or computational resource demands owing to improved learning efficiency and data handling flexibility. Our framework achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high computational efficiency, as verified by extensive experiments on large-scale traffic datasets.</description>

      <title>Unifying Attribution-Based Explanations Using Functional Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black box problem in machine learning has led to the introduction of an ever-increasing set of explanation methods for complex models. These explanations have different properties, which in turn has led to the problem of method selection: which explanation method is most suitable for a given use case? In this work, we propose a unifying framework of attribution-based explanation methods, which provides a step towards a rigorous study of the similarities and differences of explanations. We first introduce removal-based attribution methods (RBAMs), and show that an extensively broad selection of existing methods can be viewed as such RBAMs. We then introduce the canonical additive decomposition (CAD). This is a general construction for additively decomposing any function based on the central idea of removing (groups of) features. We proceed to show that indeed every valid additive decomposition is an instance of the CAD, and that any removal-based attribution method is associated with a specific CAD. Next, we show that any removal-based attribution method can be completely defined as a game-theoretic value or interaction index for a specific (possibly constant-shifted) cooperative game, which is defined using the corresponding CAD of the method. We then use this intrinsic connection to define formal descriptions of specific behaviours of explanation methods, which we also call functional axioms, and identify sufficient conditions on the corresponding CAD and game-theoretic value or interaction index of an attribution method under which the attribution method is guaranteed to adhere to these functional axioms. Finally, we show how this unifying framework can be used to develop new, efficient approximations for existing explanation methods.</description>

      <title>TAUDiff: Improving statistical downscaling for extreme weather events using generative diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic regression-based downscaling models for climate variables often suffer from spectral bias, which can be mitigated by generative models like diffusion models. To enable efficient and reliable simulation of extreme weather events, it is crucial to achieve rapid turnaround, dynamical consistency, and accurate spatio-temporal spectral recovery. We propose an efficient correction diffusion model, TAUDiff, that combines a deterministic spatio-temporal model for mean field downscaling with a smaller generative diffusion model for recovering the fine-scale stochastic features. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on downscaling atmospheric wind velocity fields obtained from coarse GCM simulations. Our approach can not only ensure quicker simulation of extreme events but also reduce overall carbon footprint due to low inference times.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multi-Modal Integration with Tool-Augmented LLM Agents for Precise Causal Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal inference is an imperative foundation for decision-making across domains, such as smart health, AI for drug discovery and AIOps. Traditional statistical causal discovery methods, while well-established, predominantly rely on observational data and often overlook the semantic cues inherent in cause-and-effect relationships. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in an affordable way of leveraging the semantic cues for knowledge-driven causal discovery, but the development of LLMs for causal discovery lags behind other areas, particularly in the exploration of multi-modality data. To bridge the gap, we introduce MATMCD, a multi-agent system powered by tool-augmented LLMs. MATMCD has two key agents: a Data Augmentation agent that retrieves and processes modality-augmented data, and a Causal Constraint agent that integrates multi-modal data for knowledge-driven inference. Delicate design of the inner-workings ensures successful cooperation of the agents. Our empirical study across seven datasets suggests the significant potential of multi-modality enhanced causal discovery.</description>

      <title>On Enhancing Root Cause Analysis with SQL Summaries for Failures in Database Workload Replays at SAP HANA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing the workload of a database and replaying this workload for a new version of the database can be an effective approach for regression testing. However, false positive errors caused by many factors such as data privacy limitations, time dependency or non-determinism in multi-threaded environment can negatively impact the effectiveness. Therefore, we employ a machine learning based framework to automate the root cause analysis of failures found during replays. However, handling unseen novel issues not found in the training data is one general challenge of machine learning approaches with respect to generalizability of the learned model. We describe how we continue to address this challenge for more robust long-term solutions. From our experience, retraining with new failures is inadequate due to features overlapping across distinct root causes. Hence, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to analyze failed SQL statements and extract concise failure summaries as an additional feature to enhance the classification process. Our experiments show the F1-Macro score improved by 4.77% for our data. We consider our approach beneficial for providing end users with additional information to gain more insights into the found issues and to improve the assessment of the replay results.</description>

      <title>Personalized Clustering via Targeted Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering traditionally aims to reveal a natural grouping structure model from unlabeled data. However, this model may not always align with users' preference. In this paper, we propose a personalized clustering method that explicitly performs targeted representation learning by interacting with users via modicum task information (e.g., $\textit{must-link}$ or $\textit{cannot-link}$ pairs) to guide the clustering direction. We query users with the most informative pairs, i.e., those pairs most hard to cluster and those most easy to miscluster, to facilitate the representation learning in terms of the clustering preference. Moreover, by exploiting attention mechanism, the targeted representation is learned and augmented. By leveraging the targeted representation and constrained constrastive loss as well, personalized clustering is obtained. Theoretically, we verify that the risk of personalized clustering is tightly bounded, guaranteeing that active queries to users do mitigate the clustering risk. Experimentally, extensive results show that our method performs well across different clustering tasks and datasets, even with a limited number of queries.</description>

      <title>Splitting criteria for ordinal decision trees: an experimental study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordinal Classification (OC) is a machine learning field that addresses classification tasks where the labels exhibit a natural order. Unlike nominal classification, which treats all classes as equally distinct, OC takes the ordinal relationship into account, producing more accurate and relevant results. This is particularly critical in applications where the magnitude of classification errors has implications. Despite this, OC problems are often tackled using nominal methods, leading to suboptimal solutions. Although decision trees are one of the most popular classification approaches, ordinal tree-based approaches have received less attention when compared to other classifiers. This work conducts an experimental study of tree-based methodologies specifically designed to capture ordinal relationships. A comprehensive survey of ordinal splitting criteria is provided, standardising the notations used in the literature for clarity. Three ordinal splitting criteria, Ordinal Gini (OGini), Weighted Information Gain (WIG), and Ranking Impurity (RI), are compared to the nominal counterparts of the first two (Gini and information gain), by incorporating them into a decision tree classifier. An extensive repository considering 45 publicly available OC datasets is presented, supporting the first experimental comparison of ordinal and nominal splitting criteria using well-known OC evaluation metrics. Statistical analysis of the results highlights OGini as the most effective ordinal splitting criterion to date. Source code, datasets, and results are made available to the research community.</description>

      <title>AnchorInv: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning of Physiological Signals via Representation Space Guided Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in a variety of real-world applications. These successes are often attributed to strong base models that can generalize to novel tasks with limited supporting data while keeping prior knowledge intact. However, these impressive results are based on the availability of a large amount of high-quality data, which is often lacking in specialized biomedical applications. In such fields, models are usually developed with limited data that arrive incrementally with novel categories. This requires the model to adapt to new information while preserving existing knowledge. Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) methods offer a promising approach to addressing these challenges, but they also depend on strong base models that face the same aforementioned limitations. To overcome these constraints, we propose AnchorInv following the straightforward and efficient buffer-replay strategy. Instead of selecting and storing raw data, AnchorInv generates synthetic samples guided by anchor points in the feature space. This approach protects privacy and regularizes the model for adaptation. When evaluated on three public physiological time series datasets, AnchorInv exhibits efficient knowledge forgetting prevention and improved adaptation to novel classes, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>SSE-SAM: Balancing Head and Tail Classes Gradually through Stage-Wise SAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world datasets often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, where vast majority of classes known as tail classes have only few samples. Traditional methods tend to overfit on these tail classes. Recently, a new approach called Imbalanced SAM (ImbSAM) is proposed to leverage the generalization benefits of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) for long-tailed distributions. The main strategy is to merely enhance the smoothness of the loss function for tail classes. However, we argue that improving generalization in long-tail scenarios requires a careful balance between head and tail classes. We show that neither SAM nor ImbSAM alone can fully achieve this balance. For SAM, we prove that although it enhances the model's generalization ability by escaping saddle point in the overall loss landscape, it does not effectively address this for tail-class losses. Conversely, while ImbSAM is more effective at avoiding saddle points in tail classes, the head classes are trained insufficiently, resulting in significant performance drops. Based on these insights, we propose Stage-wise Saddle Escaping SAM (SSE-SAM), which uses complementary strengths of ImbSAM and SAM in a phased approach. Initially, SSE-SAM follows the majority sample to avoid saddle points of the head-class loss. During the later phase, it focuses on tail-classes to help them escape saddle points. Our experiments confirm that SSE-SAM has better ability in escaping saddles both on head and tail classes, and shows performance improvements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are crucial in various applications, but their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices poses challenges. This study presents the Sum-of-Products (SOP) units for convolution, which utilize low-latency left-to-right bit-serial arithmetic to minimize response time and enhance overall performance. The study proposes a methodology for fusing multiple convolution layers to reduce off-chip memory communication and increase overall performance. An effective mechanism detects and skips inefficient convolutions after ReLU layers, minimizing power consumption without compromising accuracy. Furthermore, efficient tile movement guarantees uniform access to the fusion pyramid. An analysis demonstrates the utile stride strategy improves operational intensity. Two designs cater to varied demands: one focuses on minimal response time for mission-critical applications, and another focuses on resource-constrained devices with comparable latency. This approach notably reduced redundant computations, improving the efficiency of CNN deployment on edge devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel and scalable framework for uncertainty estimation and separation with applications in data driven modeling in science and engineering tasks where reliable uncertainty quantification is critical. Leveraging an ensemble of quantile regression (E-QR) models, our approach enhances aleatoric uncertainty estimation while preserving the quality of epistemic uncertainty, surpassing competing methods, such as Deep Ensembles (DE) and Monte Carlo (MC) dropout. To address challenges in separating uncertainty types, we propose an algorithm that iteratively improves separation through progressive sampling in regions of high uncertainty. Our framework is scalable to large datasets and demonstrates superior performance on synthetic benchmarks, offering a robust tool for uncertainty quantification in data-driven applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal Exact Recovery in Semi-Supervised Learning: A Study of Spectral Methods and Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We delve into the challenge of semi-supervised node classification on the Contextual Stochastic Block Model (CSBM) dataset. Here, nodes from the two-cluster Stochastic Block Model (SBM) are coupled with feature vectors, which are derived from a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) that corresponds to their respective node labels. With only a subset of the CSBM node labels accessible for training, our primary objective becomes the accurate classification of the remaining nodes. Venturing into the transductive learning landscape, we, for the first time, pinpoint the information-theoretical threshold for the exact recovery of all test nodes in CSBM. Concurrently, we design an optimal spectral estimator inspired by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with the training labels and essential data from both the adjacency matrix and feature vectors. We also evaluate the efficacy of graph ridge regression and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) on this synthetic dataset. Our findings underscore that graph ridge regression and GCN possess the ability to achieve the information threshold of exact recovery in a manner akin to the optimal estimator when using the optimal weighted self-loops. This highlights the potential role of feature learning in augmenting the proficiency of GCN, especially in the realm of semi-supervised learning.</description>

      <title>Federated Source-free Domain Adaptation for Classification: Weighted Cluster Aggregation for Unlabeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) commonly assumes that the server or some clients have labeled data, which is often impractical due to annotation costs and privacy concerns. Addressing this problem, we focus on a source-free domain adaptation task, where (1) the server holds a pre-trained model on labeled source domain data, (2) clients possess only unlabeled data from various target domains, and (3) the server and clients cannot access the source data in the adaptation phase. This task is known as Federated source-Free Domain Adaptation (FFREEDA). Specifically, we focus on classification tasks, while the previous work solely studies semantic segmentation. Our contribution is the novel Federated learning with Weighted Cluster Aggregation (FedWCA) method, designed to mitigate both domain shifts and privacy concerns with only unlabeled data. FedWCA comprises three phases: private and parameter-free clustering of clients to obtain domain-specific global models on the server, weighted aggregation of the global models for the clustered clients, and local domain adaptation with pseudo-labeling. Experimental results show that FedWCA surpasses several existing methods and baselines in FFREEDA, establishing its effectiveness and practicality.</description>

      <title>Cultivating Archipelago of Forests: Evolving Robust Decision Trees through Island Coevolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision trees are widely used in machine learning due to their simplicity and interpretability, but they often lack robustness to adversarial attacks and data perturbations. The paper proposes a novel island-based coevolutionary algorithm (ICoEvoRDF) for constructing robust decision tree ensembles. The algorithm operates on multiple islands, each containing populations of decision trees and adversarial perturbations. The populations on each island evolve independently, with periodic migration of top-performing decision trees between islands. This approach fosters diversity and enhances the exploration of the solution space, leading to more robust and accurate decision tree ensembles. ICoEvoRDF utilizes a popular game theory concept of mixed Nash equilibrium for ensemble weighting, which further leads to improvement in results. ICoEvoRDF is evaluated on 20 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in optimizing both adversarial accuracy and minimax regret. The flexibility of ICoEvoRDF allows for the integration of decision trees from various existing methods, providing a unified framework for combining diverse solutions. Our approach offers a promising direction for developing robust and interpretable machine learning models</description>

      <title>Rehearsal-Free Continual Federated Learning with Synergistic Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual Federated Learning (CFL) allows distributed devices to collaboratively learn novel concepts from continuously shifting training data while avoiding knowledge forgetting of previously seen tasks. To tackle this challenge, most current CFL approaches rely on extensive rehearsal of previous data. Despite effectiveness, rehearsal comes at a cost to memory, and it may also violate data privacy. Considering these, we seek to apply regularization techniques to CFL by considering their cost-efficient properties that do not require sample caching or rehearsal. Specifically, we first apply traditional regularization techniques to CFL and observe that existing regularization techniques, especially synaptic intelligence, can achieve promising results under homogeneous data distribution but fail when the data is heterogeneous. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective regularization algorithm for CFL named FedSSI, which tailors the synaptic intelligence for the CFL with heterogeneous data settings. FedSSI can not only reduce computational overhead without rehearsal but also address the data heterogeneity issue. Extensive experiments show that FedSSI achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Toward Efficient Data-Free Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning without access to real data distribution is challenging. The existing method based on data-free distillation achieved unlearning by filtering out synthetic samples containing forgetting information but struggled to distill the retaining-related knowledge efficiently. In this work, we analyze that such a problem is due to over-filtering, which reduces the synthesized retaining-related information. We propose a novel method, Inhibited Synthetic PostFilter (ISPF), to tackle this challenge from two perspectives: First, the Inhibited Synthetic, by reducing the synthesized forgetting information; Second, the PostFilter, by fully utilizing the retaining-related information in synthesized samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ISPF effectively tackles the challenge and outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <title>Mix-LN: Unleashing the Power of Deeper Layers by Combining Pre-LN and Post-LN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet recent findings reveal that their deeper layers often contribute minimally and can be pruned without affecting overall performance. While some view this as an opportunity for model compression, we identify it as a training shortfall rooted in the widespread use of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN). We demonstrate that Pre-LN, commonly employed in models like GPT and LLaMA, leads to diminished gradient norms in its deeper layers, reducing their effectiveness. In contrast, Post-Layer Normalization (Post-LN) preserves larger gradient norms in deeper layers but suffers from vanishing gradients in earlier layers. To address this, we introduce Mix-LN, a novel normalization technique that combines the strengths of Pre-LN and Post-LN within the same model. Mix-LN applies Post-LN to the earlier layers and Pre-LN to the deeper layers, ensuring more uniform gradients across layers. This allows all parts of the network--both shallow and deep layers--to contribute effectively to training. Extensive experiments with various model sizes from 70M to 7B demonstrate that Mix-LN consistently outperforms both Pre-LN and Post-LN, promoting more balanced, healthier gradient norms throughout the network, and enhancing the overall quality of LLM pre-training. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models pre-trained with Mix-LN learn better compared to those using Pre-LN or Post-LN during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), highlighting the critical importance of high-quality deep layers. By effectively addressing the inefficiencies of deep layers in current LLMs, Mix-LN unlocks their potential, enhancing model capacity without increasing model size.

      <title>Extreme Multi-label Completion for Semantic Document Labelling with Taxonomy-Aware Parallel Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Extreme Multi Label Completion (XMLCo), the objective is to predict the missing labels of a collection of documents. Together with XML Classification, XMLCo is arguably one of the most challenging document classification tasks, as the very high number of labels (at least ten of thousands) is generally very large compared to the number of available labelled documents in the training dataset. Such a task is often accompanied by a taxonomy that encodes the labels organic relationships, and many methods have been proposed to leverage this hierarchy to improve the results of XMLCo algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new approach to this problem, TAMLEC (Taxonomy-Aware Multi-task Learning for Extreme multi-label Completion). TAMLEC divides the problem into several Taxonomy-Aware Tasks, i.e. subsets of labels adapted to the hierarchical paths of the taxonomy, and trains on these tasks using a dynamic Parallel Feature sharing approach, where some parts of the model are shared between tasks while others are task-specific. Then, at inference time, TAMLEC uses the labels available in a document to infer the appropriate tasks and to predict missing labels. To achieve this result, TAMLEC uses a modified transformer architecture that predicts ordered sequences of labels on a Weak-Semilattice structure that is naturally induced by the tasks. This approach yields multiple advantages. First, our experiments on real-world datasets show that TAMLEC outperforms state-of-the-art methods for various XMLCo problems. Second, TAMLEC is by construction particularly suited for few-shots XML tasks, where new tasks or labels are introduced with only few examples, and extensive evaluations highlight its strong performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Power of Continual Learning on Non-Centralized Devices: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Centralized Continual Learning (NCCL) has become an emerging paradigm for enabling distributed devices such as vehicles and servers to handle streaming data from a joint non-stationary environment. To achieve high reliability and scalability in deploying this paradigm in distributed systems, it is essential to conquer challenges stemming from both spatial and temporal dimensions, manifesting as distribution shifts, catastrophic forgetting, heterogeneity, and privacy issues. This survey focuses on a comprehensive examination of the development of the non-centralized continual learning algorithms and the real-world deployment across distributed devices. We begin with an introduction to the background and fundamentals of non-centralized learning and continual learning. Then, we review existing solutions from three levels to represent how existing techniques alleviate the catastrophic forgetting and distribution shift. Additionally, we delve into the various types of heterogeneity issues, security, and privacy attributes, as well as real-world applications across three prevalent scenarios. Furthermore, we establish a large-scale benchmark to revisit this problem and analyze the performance of the state-of-the-art NCCL approaches. Finally, we discuss the important challenges and future research directions in NCCL.</description>

      <title>Graph Coarsening via Supervised Granular-Ball for Scalable Graph Neural Network Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant achievements in processing graph data, yet scalability remains a substantial challenge. To address this, numerous graph coarsening methods have been developed. However, most existing coarsening methods are training-dependent, leading to lower efficiency, and they all require a predefined coarsening rate, lacking an adaptive approach. In this paper, we employ granular-ball computing to effectively compress graph data. We construct a coarsened graph network by iteratively splitting the graph into granular-balls based on a purity threshold and using these granular-balls as super vertices. This granulation process significantly reduces the size of the original graph, thereby greatly enhancing the training efficiency and scalability of GNNs. Additionally, our algorithm can adaptively perform splitting without requiring a predefined coarsening rate. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves accuracy comparable to training on the original graph. Noise injection experiments further indicate that our method exhibits robust performance. Moreover, our approach can reduce the graph size by up to 20 times without compromising test accuracy, substantially enhancing the scalability of GNNs.</description>

      <title>Energy-Based Preference Model Offers Better Offline Alignment than the Bradley-Terry Preference Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the debut of DPO, it has been shown that aligning a target LLM with human preferences via the KL-constrained RLHF loss is mathematically equivalent to a special kind of reward modeling task. Concretely, the task requires: 1) using the target LLM to parameterize the reward model, and 2) tuning the reward model so that it has a 1:1 linear relationship with the true reward. However, we identify a significant issue: the DPO loss might have multiple minimizers, of which only one satisfies the required linearity condition. The problem arises from a well-known issue of the underlying Bradley-Terry preference model: it does not always have a unique maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). Consequently,the minimizer of the RLHF loss might be unattainable because it is merely one among many minimizers of the DPO loss. As a better alternative, we propose an energy-based model (EBM) that always has a unique MLE, inherently satisfying the linearity requirement. To approximate the MLE in practice, we propose a contrastive loss named Energy Preference Alignment (EPA), wherein each positive sample is contrasted against one or more strong negatives as well as many free weak negatives. Theoretical properties of our EBM enable the approximation error of EPA to almost surely vanish when a sufficient number of negatives are used. Empirically, we demonstrate that EPA consistently delivers better performance on open benchmarks compared to DPO, thereby showing the superiority of our EBM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning methods have seen a meteoric rise in their applications in the scientific community. However, little effort has been put into understanding these "black box" models. We show how one can apply integrated gradients (IGs) to understand these models by designing different baselines, by taking an example case study in particle physics. We find that the zero-vector baseline does not provide good feature attributions and that an averaged baseline sampled from the background events provides consistently more reasonable attributions.</description>

      <title>SHAP scores fail pervasively even when Lipschitz succeeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ubiquitous use of Shapley values in eXplainable AI (XAI) has been triggered by the tool SHAP, and as a result are commonly referred to as SHAP scores. Recent work devised examples of machine learning (ML) classifiers for which the computed SHAP scores are thoroughly unsatisfactory, by allowing human decision-makers to be misled. Nevertheless, such examples could be perceived as somewhat artificial, since the selected classes must be interpreted as numeric. Furthermore, it was unclear how general were the issues identified with SHAP scores. This paper answers these criticisms. First, the paper shows that for Boolean classifiers there are arbitrarily many examples for which the SHAP scores must be deemed unsatisfactory. Second, the paper shows that the issues with SHAP scores are also observed in the case of regression models. In addition, the paper studies the class of regression models that respect Lipschitz continuity, a measure of a function's rate of change that finds important recent uses in ML, including model robustness. Concretely, the paper shows that the issues with SHAP scores occur even for regression models that respect Lipschitz continuity. Finally, the paper shows that the same issues are guaranteed to exist for arbitrarily differentiable regression models.</description>

      <title>Graph-Driven Models for Gas Mixture Identification and Concentration Estimation on Heterogeneous Sensor Array Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately identifying gas mixtures and estimating their concentrations are crucial across various industrial applications using gas sensor arrays. However, existing models face challenges in generalizing across heterogeneous datasets, which limits their scalability and practical applicability. To address this problem, this study develops two novel deep-learning models that integrate temporal graph structures for enhanced performance: a Graph-Enhanced Capsule Network (GraphCapsNet) employing dynamic routing for gas mixture classification and a Graph-Enhanced Attention Network (GraphANet) leveraging self-attention for concentration estimation. Both models were validated on datasets from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository and a custom dataset, demonstrating superior performance in gas mixture identification and concentration estimation compared to recent models. In classification tasks, GraphCapsNet achieved over 98.00% accuracy across multiple datasets, while in concentration estimation, GraphANet attained an R2 score exceeding 0.96 across various gas components. Both GraphCapsNet and GraphANet exhibited significantly higher accuracy and stability, positioning them as promising solutions for scalable gas analysis in industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Inference of Neural Fluid Fields via SciML Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in 3D vision have enabled successful progress in inferring neural fluid fields and realistic rendering of fluid dynamics. However, these methods require real-world flow captures, which demand dense video sequences and specialized lab setups, making the process costly and challenging. Scientific machine learning (SciML) foundation models, which are pretrained on extensive simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs), encode rich multiphysics knowledge and thus provide promising sources of domain priors for inferring fluid fields. Nevertheless, their potential to advance real-world vision problems remains largely underexplored, raising questions about the transferability and practical utility of these foundation models. In this work, we demonstrate that SciML foundation model can significantly improve the data efficiency of inferring real-world 3D fluid dynamics with improved generalization. At the core of our method is leveraging the strong forecasting capabilities and meaningful representations of SciML foundation models. We equip neural fluid fields with a novel collaborative training approach that utilizes augmented views and fluid features extracted by our foundation model. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, showcasing the practical applicability of SciML foundation models in real-world fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Threshold Neuron: A Brain-inspired Artificial Neuron for Efficient On-device Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the computational efficiency of on-device Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) remains a significant challengein mobile and edge computing. As we aim to execute increasingly complex tasks with constrained computational resources, much of the research has focused on compressing neural network structures and optimizing systems. Although many studies have focused on compressing neural network structures and parameters or optimizing underlying systems, there has been limited attention on optimizing the fundamental building blocks of neural networks: the neurons. In this study, we deliberate on a simple but important research question: Can we design artificial neurons that offer greater efficiency than the traditional neuron paradigm? Inspired by the threshold mechanisms and the excitation-inhibition balance observed in biological neurons, we propose a novel artificial neuron model, Threshold Neurons. Using Threshold Neurons, we can construct neural networks similar to those with traditional artificial neurons, while significantly reducing hardware implementation complexity. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of neural networks utilizing Threshold Neurons, achieving substantial power savings of 7.51x to 8.19x and area savings of 3.89x to 4.33x at the kernel level, with minimal loss in precision. Furthermore, FPGA-based implementations of these networks demonstrate 2.52x power savings and 1.75x speed enhancements at the system level. The source code will be made available upon publication.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of PM2.5 via Spatial-Diffusion guided Encoder-Decoder Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many problem settings that require spatio-temporal forecasting, the values in the time-series not only exhibit spatio-temporal correlations but are also influenced by spatial diffusion across locations. One such example is forecasting the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the atmosphere which is influenced by many complex factors, the most important ones being diffusion due to meteorological factors as well as transport across vast distances over a period of time. We present a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network architecture, that specifically captures these dependencies to forecast the PM2.5 concentration. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder and decoder parts leverage gated recurrent units (GRU) augmented with a graph neural network (TransformerConv) to account for spatial diffusion. Our model can also be seen as a generalization of various existing models for time-series or spatio-temporal forecasting. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness on two real-world PM2.5 datasets: (1) data collected by us using a recently deployed network of low-cost PM$_{2.5}$ sensors from 511 locations spanning the entirety of the Indian state of Bihar over a period of one year, and (2) another publicly available dataset that covers severely polluted regions from China for a period of 4 years. Our experimental results show our model's impressive ability to account for both spatial as well as temporal dependencies precisely.</description>

      <title>Self-attentive Transformer for Fast and Accurate Postprocessing of Temperature and Wind Speed Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current postprocessing techniques often require separate models for each lead time and disregard possible inter-ensemble relationships by either correcting each member separately or by employing distributional approaches. In this work, we tackle these shortcomings with an innovative, fast and accurate Transformer which postprocesses each ensemble member individually while allowing information exchange across variables, spatial dimensions and lead times by means of multi-headed self-attention. Weather foreacasts are postprocessed over 20 lead times simultaneously while including up to twelve meteorological predictors. We use the EUPPBench dataset for training which contains ensemble predictions from the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts' integrated forecasting system alongside corresponding observations. The work presented here is the first to postprocess the ten and one hundred-meter wind speed forecasts within this benchmark dataset, while also correcting the two-meter temperature. Our approach significantly improves the original forecasts, as measured by the CRPS, with 17.5 % for two-meter temperature, nearly 5% for ten-meter wind speed and 5.3 % for one hundred-meter wind speed, outperforming a classical member-by-member approach employed as competitive benchmark. Furthermore, being up to 75 times faster, it fulfills the demand for rapid operational weather forecasts in various downstream applications, including renewable energy forecasting.</description>

      <title>Harvesting energy from turbulent winds with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) is an emerging technology designed to harness the power of high-altitude winds, offering a solution to several limitations of conventional wind turbines. AWE is based on flying devices (usually gliders or kites) that, tethered to a ground station and driven by the wind, convert its mechanical energy into electrical energy by means of a generator. Such systems are usually controlled by manoeuvering the kite so as to follow a predefined path prescribed by optimal control techniques, such as model-predictive control. These methods are strongly dependent on the specific model at use and difficult to generalize, especially in unpredictable conditions such as the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer. Our aim is to explore the possibility of replacing these techniques with an approach based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unlike traditional methods, RL does not require a predefined model, making it robust to variability and uncertainty. Our experimental results in complex simulated environments demonstrate that AWE agents trained with RL can effectively extract energy from turbulent flows, relying on minimal local information about the kite orientation and speed relative to the wind.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning-Based Imputation Techniques for Air Quality Datasets with High Missing Data Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban pollution poses serious health risks, particularly in relation to traffic-related air pollution, which remains a major concern in many cities. Vehicle emissions contribute to respiratory and cardiovascular issues, especially for vulnerable and exposed road users like pedestrians and cyclists. Therefore, accurate air quality monitoring with high spatial resolution is vital for good urban environmental management. This study aims to provide insights for processing spatiotemporal datasets with high missing data rates. In this study, the challenge of high missing data rates is a result of the limited data available and the fine granularity required for precise classification of PM2.5 levels. The data used for analysis and imputation were collected from both mobile sensors and fixed stations by Dynamic Parcel Distribution, the Environmental Protection Agency, and Google in Dublin, Ireland, where the missing data rate was approximately 82.42%, making accurate Particulate Matter 2.5 level predictions particularly difficult. Various imputation and prediction approaches were evaluated and compared, including ensemble methods, deep learning models, and diffusion models. External features such as traffic flow, weather conditions, and data from the nearest stations were incorporated to enhance model performance. The results indicate that diffusion methods with external features achieved the highest F1 score, reaching 0.9486 (Accuracy: 94.26%, Precision: 94.42%, Recall: 94.82%), with ensemble models achieving the highest accuracy of 94.82%, illustrating that good performance can be obtained despite a high missing data rate.</description>

      <title>RAG for Effective Supply Chain Security Questionnaire Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era where digital security is crucial, efficient processing of security-related inquiries through supply chain security questionnaires is imperative. This paper introduces a novel approach using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate these responses. We developed QuestSecure, a system that interprets diverse document formats and generates precise responses by integrating large language models (LLMs) with an advanced retrieval system. Our experiments show that QuestSecure significantly improves response accuracy and operational efficiency. By employing advanced NLP techniques and tailored retrieval mechanisms, the system consistently produces contextually relevant and semantically rich responses, reducing cognitive load on security teams and minimizing potential errors. This research offers promising avenues for automating complex security management tasks, enhancing organizational security processes.</description>

      <title>Few-shot Steerable Alignment: Adapting Rewards and LLM Policies with Neural Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in everyday applications, ensuring their alignment with the diverse preferences of individual users has become a critical challenge. Currently deployed approaches typically assume homogeneous user objectives and rely on single-objective fine-tuning. However, human preferences are inherently heterogeneous, influenced by various unobservable factors, leading to conflicting signals in preference data. Existing solutions addressing this diversity often require costly datasets labelled for specific objectives and involve training multiple reward models or LLM policies, which is computationally expensive and impractical. In this work, we present a novel framework for few-shot steerable alignment, where users' underlying preferences are inferred from a small sample of their choices. To achieve this, we extend the Bradley-Terry-Luce model to handle heterogeneous preferences with unobserved variability factors and propose its practical implementation for reward modelling and LLM fine-tuning. Thanks to our proposed approach of functional parameter-space conditioning, LLMs trained with our framework can be adapted to individual preferences at inference time, generating outputs over a continuum of behavioural modes. We empirically validate the effectiveness of methods, demonstrating their ability to capture and align with diverse human preferences in a data-efficient manner. Our code is made available at: https://github.com/kasia-kobalczyk/few-shot-steerable-alignment.</description>

      <title>Landscape of AI safety concerns -- A methodology to support safety assurance for AI-based autonomous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a key technology, driving advancements across a range of applications. Its integration into modern autonomous systems requires assuring safety. However, the challenge of assuring safety in systems that incorporate AI components is substantial. The lack of concrete specifications, and also the complexity of both the operational environment and the system itself, leads to various aspects of uncertain behavior and complicates the derivation of convincing evidence for system safety. Nonetheless, scholars proposed to thoroughly analyze and mitigate AI-specific insufficiencies, so-called AI safety concerns, which yields essential evidence supporting a convincing assurance case. In this paper, we build upon this idea and propose the so-called Landscape of AI Safety Concerns, a novel methodology designed to support the creation of safety assurance cases for AI-based systems by systematically demonstrating the absence of AI safety concerns. The methodology's application is illustrated through a case study involving a driverless regional train, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Machine learning in wastewater treatment: insights from modelling a pilot denitrification reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wastewater treatment plants are increasingly recognized as promising candidates for machine learning applications, due to their societal importance and high availability of data. However, their varied designs, operational conditions, and influent characteristics hinder straightforward automation. In this study, we use data from a pilot reactor at the Veas treatment facility in Norway to explore how machine learning can be used to optimize biological nitrate ($\mathrm{NO_3^-}$) reduction to molecular nitrogen ($\mathrm{N_2}$) in the biogeochemical process known as \textit{denitrification}. Rather than focusing solely on predictive accuracy, our approach prioritizes understanding the foundational requirements for effective data-driven modelling of wastewater treatment. Specifically, we aim to identify which process parameters are most critical, the necessary data quantity and quality, how to structure data effectively, and what properties are required by the models. We find that nonlinear models perform best on the training and validation data sets, indicating nonlinear relationships to be learned, but linear models transfer better to the unseen test data, which comes later in time. The variable measuring the water temperature has a particularly detrimental effect on the models, owing to a significant change in distributions between training and test data. We therefore conclude that multiple years of data is necessary to learn robust machine learning models. By addressing foundational elements, particularly in the context of the climatic variability faced by northern regions, this work lays the groundwork for a more structured and tailored approach to machine learning for wastewater treatment. We share publicly both the data and code used to produce the results in the paper.</description>

      <title>Evidential Deep Learning for Probabilistic Modelling of Extreme Storm Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods play an important role in reducing errors in weather forecasting. Conventional approaches in UQ for weather forecasting rely on generating an ensemble of forecasts from physics-based simulations to estimate the uncertainty. However, it is computationally expensive to generate many forecasts to predict real-time extreme weather events. Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) is an uncertainty-aware deep learning approach designed to provide confidence about its predictions using only one forecast. It treats learning as an evidence acquisition process where more evidence is interpreted as increased predictive confidence. We apply EDL to storm forecasting using real-world weather datasets and compare its performance with traditional methods. Our findings indicate that EDL not only reduces computational overhead but also enhances predictive uncertainty. This method opens up novel opportunities in research areas such as climate risk assessment, where quantifying the uncertainty about future climate is crucial.</description>

      <title>Online MDP with Transition Prototypes: A Robust Adaptive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider an online robust Markov Decision Process (MDP) where we have the information of finitely many prototypes of the underlying transition kernel. We consider an adaptively updated ambiguity set of the prototypes and propose an algorithm that efficiently identifies the true underlying transition kernel while guaranteeing the performance of the corresponding robust policy. To be more specific, we provide a sublinear regret of the subsequent optimal robust policy. We also provide an early stopping mechanism and a worst-case performance bound of the value function. In numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, particularly in the early stage with limited data. This work contributes to robust MDPs by considering possible prior information about the underlying transition probability and online learning, offering both theoretical insights and practical algorithms for improved decision-making under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of Distributed Machine Learning against Transfer Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although distributed machine learning (distributed ML) is gaining considerable attention in the community, prior works have independently looked at instances of distributed ML in either the training or the inference phase. No prior work has examined the combined robustness stemming from distributing both the learning and the inference process. In this work, we explore, for the first time, the robustness of distributed ML models that are fully heterogeneous in training data, architecture, scheduler, optimizer, and other model parameters. Supported by theory and extensive experimental validation using CIFAR10 and FashionMNIST, we show that such properly distributed ML instantiations achieve across-the-board improvements in accuracy-robustness tradeoffs against state-of-the-art transfer-based attacks that could otherwise not be realized by current ensemble or federated learning instantiations. For instance, our experiments on CIFAR10 show that for the Common Weakness attack, one of the most powerful state-of-the-art transfer-based attacks, our method improves robust accuracy by up to 40%, with a minimal impact on clean task accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video games are a natural and synergistic application domain for artificial intelligence (AI) systems, offering both the potential to enhance player experience and immersion, as well as providing valuable benchmarks and virtual environments to advance AI technologies in general. This report presents a high-level overview of five promising research pathways for applying state-of-the-art AI methods, particularly deep learning, to digital gaming within the context of the current research landscape. The objective of this work is to outline a curated, non-exhaustive list of encouraging research directions at the intersection of AI and video games that may serve to inspire more rigorous and comprehensive research efforts in the future. We discuss (i) investigating large language models as core engines for game agent modelling, (ii) using neural cellular automata for procedural game content generation, (iii) accelerating computationally expensive in-game simulations via deep surrogate modelling, (iv) leveraging self-supervised learning to obtain useful video game state embeddings, and (v) training generative models of interactive worlds using unlabelled video data. We also briefly address current technical challenges associated with the integration of advanced deep learning systems into video game development, and indicate key areas where further progress is likely to be beneficial.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Concept Bottleneck for Foundation Models Under Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in foundation models (FMs) have led to a paradigm shift in machine learning. The rich, expressive feature representations from these pre-trained, large-scale FMs are leveraged for multiple downstream tasks, usually via lightweight fine-tuning of a shallow fully-connected network following the representation. However, the non-interpretable, black-box nature of this prediction pipeline can be a challenge, especially in critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and security. In this paper, we explore the potential of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) for transforming complex, non-interpretable foundation models into interpretable decision-making pipelines using high-level concept vectors. Specifically, we focus on the test-time deployment of such an interpretable CBM pipeline "in the wild", where the input distribution often shifts from the original training distribution. We first identify the potential failure modes of such a pipeline under different types of distribution shifts. Then we propose an adaptive concept bottleneck framework to address these failure modes, that dynamically adapts the concept-vector bank and the prediction layer based solely on unlabeled data from the target domain, without access to the source (training) dataset. Empirical evaluations with various real-world distribution shifts show that our adaptation method produces concept-based interpretations better aligned with the test data and boosts post-deployment accuracy by up to 28%, aligning the CBM performance with that of non-interpretable classification.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Co-pilot for Screening of Organic Molecular Additives for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has been extensively employed in planar perovskite photovoltaics to screen effective organic molecular additives, while encountering predictive biases for novel materials due to small datasets and reliance on predefined descriptors. Present work thus proposes an effective approach, Co-Pilot for Perovskite Additive Screener (Co-PAS), an ML-driven framework designed to accelerate additive screening for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Co-PAS overcomes predictive biases by integrating the Molecular Scaffold Classifier (MSC) for scaffold-based pre-screening and utilizing Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder (JTVAE) latent vectors to enhance molecular structure representation, thereby enhancing the accuracy of power conversion efficiency (PCE) predictions. Leveraging Co-PAS, we integrate domain knowledge to screen an extensive dataset of 250,000 molecules from PubChem, prioritizing candidates based on predicted PCE values and key molecular properties such as donor number, dipole moment, and hydrogen bond acceptor count. This workflow leads to the identification of several promising passivating molecules, including the novel Boc-L-threonine N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (BTN), which, to our knowledge, has not been explored as an additive in PSCs and achieves a device PCE of 25.20%. Our results underscore the potential of Co-PAS in advancing additive discovery for high-performance PSCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer learning aims to transfer knowledge or information from a source domain to a relevant target domain. In this paper, we understand transfer learning from the perspectives of knowledge transferability and trustworthiness. This involves two research questions: How is knowledge transferability quantitatively measured and enhanced across domains? Can we trust the transferred knowledge in the transfer learning process? To answer these questions, this paper provides a comprehensive review of trustworthy transfer learning from various aspects, including problem definitions, theoretical analysis, empirical algorithms, and real-world applications. Specifically, we summarize recent theories and algorithms for understanding knowledge transferability under (within-domain) IID and non-IID assumptions. In addition to knowledge transferability, we review the impact of trustworthiness on transfer learning, e.g., whether the transferred knowledge is adversarially robust or algorithmically fair, how to transfer the knowledge under privacy-preserving constraints, etc. Beyond discussing the current advancements, we highlight the open questions and future directions for understanding transfer learning in a reliable and trustworthy manner.</description>

      <title>On Calibration in Multi-Distribution Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern challenges of robustness, fairness, and decision-making in machine learning have led to the formulation of multi-distribution learning (MDL) frameworks in which a predictor is optimized across multiple distributions. We study the calibration properties of MDL to better understand how the predictor performs uniformly across the multiple distributions. Through classical results on decomposing proper scoring losses, we first derive the Bayes optimal rule for MDL, demonstrating that it maximizes the generalized entropy of the associated loss function. Our analysis reveals that while this approach ensures minimal worst-case loss, it can lead to non-uniform calibration errors across the multiple distributions and there is an inherent calibration-refinement trade-off, even at Bayes optimality. Our results highlight a critical limitation: despite the promise of MDL, one must use caution when designing predictors tailored to multiple distributions so as to minimize disparity.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Transfer Learning from Swahili: Advancing Solutions for Comorian Dialects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If today some African languages like Swahili have enough resources to develop high-performing Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems, many other languages spoken on the continent are still lacking such support. For these languages, still in their infancy, several possibilities exist to address this critical lack of data. Among them is Transfer Learning, which allows low-resource languages to benefit from the good representation of other languages that are similar to them. In this work, we adopt a similar approach, aiming to pioneer NLP technologies for Comorian, a group of four languages or dialects belonging to the Bantu family.
  Our approach is initially motivated by the hypothesis that if a human can understand a different language from their native language with little or no effort, it would be entirely possible to model this process on a machine. To achieve this, we consider ways to construct Comorian datasets mixed with Swahili. One thing to note here is that in terms of Swahili data, we only focus on elements that are closest to Comorian by calculating lexical distances between candidate and source data. We empirically test this hypothesis in two use cases: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT). Our MT model achieved ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of 0.6826, 0.42, and 0.6532, respectively, while our ASR system recorded a WER of 39.50\% and a CER of 13.76\%. This research is crucial for advancing NLP in underrepresented languages, with potential to preserve and promote Comorian linguistic heritage in the digital age.</description>

      <title>Forward and Inverse Simulation of Pseudo-Two-Dimensional Model of Lithium-Ion Batteries Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the challenges posed by the high nonlinearity of the Butler-Volmer (BV) equation in forward and inverse simulations of the pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) model using the physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework. The BV equation presents significant challenges for PINNs, primarily due to the hyperbolic sine term, which renders the Hessian of the PINN loss function highly ill-conditioned. To address this issue, we introduce a bypassing term that improves numerical stability by substantially reducing the condition number of the Hessian matrix. Furthermore, the small magnitude of the ionic flux \( j \) often leads to a common failure mode where PINNs converge to incorrect solutions. We demonstrate that incorporating a secondary conservation law for the solid-phase potential \( \psi \) effectively prevents such convergence issues and ensures solution accuracy. The proposed methods prove effective for solving both forward and inverse problems involving the BV equation. Specifically, we achieve precise parameter estimation in inverse scenarios and reliable solution predictions for forward simulations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Two-Phase Finetuning LLMs for Japanese Legal Text Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text Retrieval (TR) involves finding and retrieving text-based content relevant to a user's query from a large repository, with applications in real-world scenarios such as legal document retrieval. While most existing studies focus on English, limited work addresses Japanese contexts. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset specifically designed for Japanese legal contexts and propose a novel two-phase pipeline tailored to this domain.
  In the first phase, the model learns a broad understanding of global contexts, enhancing its generalization and adaptability to diverse queries. In the second phase, the model is fine-tuned to address complex queries specific to legal scenarios. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of our method, which outperforms existing baselines.
  Furthermore, our pipeline proves effective in English contexts, surpassing comparable baselines on the MS MARCO dataset. We have made our code publicly available on GitHub, and the model checkpoints are accessible via HuggingFace.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality benchmarks are the foundation for embodied AI research, enabling significant advancements in long-horizon navigation, manipulation and rearrangement tasks. However, as frontier tasks in robotics get more advanced, they require faster simulation speed, more intricate test environments, and larger demonstration datasets. To this end, we present MS-HAB, a holistic benchmark for low-level manipulation and in-home object rearrangement. First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of previous magical grasp implementations at similar GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against. Finally, we develop a rule-based trajectory filtering system to sample specific demonstrations from our RL policies which match predefined criteria for robot behavior and safety. Combining demonstration filtering with our fast environments enables efficient, controlled data generation at scale.</description>

      <title>TSEML: A task-specific embedding-based method for few-shot classification of cancer molecular subtypes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular subtyping of cancer is recognized as a critical and challenging upstream task for personalized therapy. Existing deep learning methods have achieved significant performance in this domain when abundant data samples are available. However, the acquisition of densely labeled samples for cancer molecular subtypes remains a significant challenge for conventional data-intensive deep learning approaches. In this work, we focus on the few-shot molecular subtype prediction problem in heterogeneous and small cancer datasets, aiming to enhance precise diagnosis and personalized treatment. We first construct a new few-shot dataset for cancer molecular subtype classification and auxiliary cancer classification, named TCGA Few-Shot, from existing publicly available datasets. To effectively leverage the relevant knowledge from both tasks, we introduce a task-specific embedding-based meta-learning framework (TSEML). TSEML leverages the synergistic strengths of a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) approach and a prototypical network (ProtoNet) to capture diverse and fine-grained features. Comparative experiments conducted on the TCGA Few-Shot dataset demonstrate that our TSEML framework achieves superior performance in addressing the problem of few-shot molecular subtype classification.</description>

      <title>C2F-TP: A Coarse-to-Fine Denoising Framework for Uncertainty-Aware Trajectory Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the trajectory of vehicles is critically important for ensuring safety and reliability in autonomous driving. Although considerable research efforts have been made recently, the inherent trajectory uncertainty caused by various factors including the dynamic driving intends and the diverse driving scenarios still poses significant challenges to accurate trajectory prediction. To address this issue, we propose C2F-TP, a coarse-to-fine denoising framework for uncertainty-aware vehicle trajectory prediction. C2F-TP features an innovative two-stage coarse-to-fine prediction process. Specifically, in the spatial-temporal interaction stage, we propose a spatial-temporal interaction module to capture the inter-vehicle interactions and learn a multimodal trajectory distribution, from which a certain number of noisy trajectories are sampled. Next, in the trajectory refinement stage, we design a conditional denoising model to reduce the uncertainty of the sampled trajectories through a step-wise denoising operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets NGSIM and highD that are widely adopted in trajectory prediction. The result demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal.</description>

      <title>Optimized two-stage AI-based Neural Decoding for Enhanced Visual Stimulus Reconstruction from fMRI Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-based neural decoding reconstructs visual perception by leveraging generative models to map brain activity, measured through functional MRI (fMRI), into latent hierarchical representations. Traditionally, ridge linear models transform fMRI into a latent space, which is then decoded using latent diffusion models (LDM) via a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE). Due to the complexity and noisiness of fMRI data, newer approaches split the reconstruction into two sequential steps, the first one providing a rough visual approximation, the second on improving the stimulus prediction via LDM endowed by CLIP embeddings. This work proposes a non-linear deep network to improve fMRI latent space representation, optimizing the dimensionality alike. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset showed that the proposed architecture improved the structural similarity of the reconstructed image by about 2\% with respect to the state-of-the-art model, based on ridge linear transform. The reconstructed image's semantics improved by about 4\%, measured by perceptual similarity, with respect to the state-of-the-art. The noise sensitivity analysis of the LDM showed that the role of the first stage was fundamental to predict the stimulus featuring high structural similarity. Conversely, providing a large noise stimulus affected less the semantics of the predicted stimulus, while the structural similarity between the ground truth and predicted stimulus was very poor. The findings underscore the importance of leveraging non-linear relationships between BOLD signal and the latent representation and two-stage generative AI for optimizing the fidelity of reconstructed visual stimuli from noisy fMRI data.</description>

      <title>Image registration is a geometric deep learning task</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven deformable image registration methods predominantly rely on operations that process grid-like inputs. However, applying deformable transformations to an image results in a warped space that deviates from a rigid grid structure. Consequently, data-driven approaches with sequential deformations have to apply grid resampling operations between each deformation step. While artifacts caused by resampling are negligible in high-resolution images, the resampling of sparse, high-dimensional feature grids introduces errors that affect the deformation modeling process. Taking inspiration from Lagrangian reference frames of deformation fields, our work introduces a novel paradigm for data-driven deformable image registration that utilizes geometric deep-learning principles to model deformations without grid requirements. Specifically, we model image features as a set of nodes that freely move in Euclidean space, update their coordinates under graph operations, and dynamically readjust their local neighborhoods. We employ this formulation to construct a multi-resolution deformable registration model, where deformation layers iteratively refine the overall transformation at each resolution without intermediate resampling operations on the feature grids. We investigate our method's ability to fully deformably capture large deformations across a number of medical imaging registration tasks. In particular, we apply our approach (GeoReg) to the registration of inter-subject brain MR images and inhale-exhale lung CT images, showing on par performance with the current state-of-the-art methods. We believe our contribution open up avenues of research to reduce the black-box nature of current learned registration paradigms by explicitly modeling the transformation within the architecture.</description>

      <title>FastVLM: Efficient Vision Encoding for Vision Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling the input image resolution is essential for enhancing the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs), particularly in text-rich image understanding tasks. However, popular visual encoders such as ViTs become inefficient at high resolutions due to the large number of tokens and high encoding latency caused by stacked self-attention layers. At different operational resolutions, the vision encoder of a VLM can be optimized along two axes: reducing encoding latency and minimizing the number of visual tokens passed to the LLM, thereby lowering overall latency. Based on a comprehensive efficiency analysis of the interplay between image resolution, vision latency, token count, and LLM size, we introduce FastVLM, a model that achieves an optimized trade-off between latency, model size and accuracy. FastVLM incorporates FastViTHD, a novel hybrid vision encoder designed to output fewer tokens and significantly reduce encoding time for high-resolution images. Unlike previous methods, FastVLM achieves the optimal balance between visual token count and image resolution solely by scaling the input image, eliminating the need for additional token pruning and simplifying the model design. In the LLaVA-1.5 setup, FastVLM achieves 3.2$\times$ improvement in time-to-first-token (TTFT) while maintaining similar performance on VLM benchmarks compared to prior works. Compared to LLaVa-OneVision at the highest resolution (1152$\times$1152), FastVLM achieves comparable performance on key benchmarks like SeedBench and MMMU, using the same 0.5B LLM, but with 85$\times$ faster TTFT and a vision encoder that is 3.4$\times$ smaller.</description>

      <title>Expansion Span: Combining Fading Memory and Retrieval in Hybrid State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "state" of State Space Models (SSMs) represents their memory, which fades exponentially over an unbounded span. By contrast, Attention-based models have "eidetic" (i.e., verbatim, or photographic) memory over a finite span (context size). Hybrid architectures combine State Space layers with Attention, but still cannot recall the distant past and can access only the most recent tokens eidetically. Unlike current methods of combining SSM and Attention layers, we allow the state to be allocated based on relevancy rather than recency. In this way, for every new set of query tokens, our models can "eidetically" access tokens from beyond the Attention span of current Hybrid SSMs without requiring extra hardware resources. We describe a method to expand the memory span of the hybrid state by "reserving" a fraction of the Attention context for tokens retrieved from arbitrarily distant in the past, thus expanding the eidetic memory span of the overall state. We call this reserved fraction of tokens the "expansion span," and the mechanism to retrieve and aggregate it "Span-Expanded Attention" (SE-Attn). To adapt Hybrid models to using SE-Attn, we propose a novel fine-tuning method that extends LoRA to Hybrid models (HyLoRA) and allows efficient adaptation on long spans of tokens. We show that SE-Attn enables us to efficiently adapt pre-trained Hybrid models on sequences of tokens up to 8 times longer than the ones used for pre-training. We show that HyLoRA with SE-Attn is cheaper and more performant than alternatives like LongLoRA when applied to Hybrid models on natural language benchmarks with long-range dependencies, such as PG-19, RULER, and other common natural language downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Catalysts of Conversation: Examining Interaction Dynamics Between Topic Initiators and Commentors in Alzheimer's Disease Online Communities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Informal caregivers (e.g.,family members or friends) of people living with Alzheimers Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) face substantial challenges and often seek informational or emotional support through online communities. Understanding the factors that drive engagement within these platforms is crucial, as it can enhance their long-term value for caregivers by ensuring that these communities effectively meet their needs. This study investigated the user interaction dynamics within two large, popular ADRD communities, TalkingPoint and ALZConnected, focusing on topic initiator engagement, initial post content, and the linguistic patterns of comments at the thread level. Using analytical methods such as propensity score matching, topic modeling, and predictive modeling, we found that active topic initiator engagement drives higher comment volumes, and reciprocal replies from topic initiators encourage further commentor engagement at the community level. Practical caregiving topics prompt more re-engagement of topic initiators, while emotional support topics attract more comments from other commentors. Additionally, the linguistic complexity and emotional tone of a comment influence its likelihood of receiving replies from topic initiators. These findings highlight the importance of fostering active and reciprocal engagement and providing effective strategies to enhance sustainability in ADRD caregiving and broader health-related online communities.</description>

      <title>Marigold-DC: Zero-Shot Monocular Depth Completion with Guided Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depth completion upgrades sparse depth measurements into dense depth maps guided by a conventional image. Existing methods for this highly ill-posed task operate in tightly constrained settings and tend to struggle when applied to images outside the training domain or when the available depth measurements are sparse, irregularly distributed, or of varying density. Inspired by recent advances in monocular depth estimation, we reframe depth completion as an image-conditional depth map generation guided by sparse measurements. Our method, Marigold-DC, builds on a pretrained latent diffusion model for monocular depth estimation and injects the depth observations as test-time guidance via an optimization scheme that runs in tandem with the iterative inference of denoising diffusion. The method exhibits excellent zero-shot generalization across a diverse range of environments and handles even extremely sparse guidance effectively. Our results suggest that contemporary monocular depth priors greatly robustify depth completion: it may be better to view the task as recovering dense depth from (dense) image pixels, guided by sparse depth; rather than as inpainting (sparse) depth, guided by an image.

      <title>MMHMR: Generative Masked Modeling for Hand Mesh Recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing a 3D hand mesh from a single RGB image is challenging due to complex articulations, self-occlusions, and depth ambiguities. Traditional discriminative methods, which learn a deterministic mapping from a 2D image to a single 3D mesh, often struggle with the inherent ambiguities in 2D-to-3D mapping. To address this challenge, we propose MMHMR, a novel generative masked model for hand mesh recovery that synthesizes plausible 3D hand meshes by learning and sampling from the probabilistic distribution of the ambiguous 2D-to-3D mapping process. MMHMR consists of two key components: (1) a VQ-MANO, which encodes 3D hand articulations as discrete pose tokens in a latent space, and (2) a Context-Guided Masked Transformer that randomly masks out pose tokens and learns their joint distribution, conditioned on corrupted token sequences, image context, and 2D pose cues. This learned distribution facilitates confidence-guided sampling during inference, producing mesh reconstructions with low uncertainty and high precision.

      <title>Distribution Shifts at Scale: Out-of-distribution Detection in Earth Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training robust deep learning models is critical in Earth Observation, where globally deployed models often face distribution shifts that degrade performance, especially in low-data regions. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection addresses this challenge by identifying inputs that differ from in-distribution (ID) data. However, existing methods either assume access to OOD data or compromise primary task performance, making them unsuitable for real-world deployment. We propose TARDIS, a post-hoc OOD detection method for scalable geospatial deployments. The core novelty lies in generating surrogate labels by integrating information from ID data and unknown distributions, enabling OOD detection at scale. Our method takes a pre-trained model, ID data, and WILD samples, disentangling the latter into surrogate ID and surrogate OOD labels based on internal activations, and fits a binary classifier as an OOD detector. We validate TARDIS on EuroSAT and xBD datasets, across 17 experimental setups covering covariate and semantic shifts, showing that it performs close to the theoretical upper bound in assigning surrogate ID and OOD samples in 13 cases. To demonstrate scalability, we deploy TARDIS on the Fields of the World dataset, offering actionable insights into pre-trained model behavior for large-scale deployments. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/geospatial-ood-detection.</description>

      <title>Pattern Matching in AI Compilers and its Formalization (Extended Version)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PyPM is a Python-based domain specific language (DSL) for building rewrite-based optimization passes on machine learning computation graphs. Users define individual optimizations by writing (a) patterns that match subgraphs of a computation graph and (b) corresponding rules which replace a matched subgraph with an optimized kernel. PyPM is distinguished from the many other DSLs for defining rewriting passes by its complex and novel pattern language which borrows concepts from logic programming. PyPM patterns can be recursive, nondeterminstic, and can require checking domain-specific constraints such as the shapes of tensors. The PyPM implementation is thus similarly complicated, consisting of thousands of lines of C++ code. In this paper, we present our work on building PyPM, as well as formalizing and distilling and this complexity to an understandable mathematical core. We have developed a formal core calculus expressing the main operations of the PyPM pattern language. We define both a declarative semantics - describing which patterns match which terms - and an algorithmic semantics - an idealized version of the PyPM pattern interpreter - and prove their equivalence. The development is fully mechanized in the Coq proof assistant.</description>

      <title>Lightweight yet Fine-grained: A Graph Capsule Convolutional Network with Subspace Alignment for Shared-account Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shared-account Sequential Recommendation (SSR) aims to provide personalized recommendations for accounts shared by multiple users with varying sequential preferences. Previous studies on SSR struggle to capture the fine-grained associations between interactions and different latent users within the shared account's hybrid sequences. Moreover, most existing SSR methods (e.g., RNN-based or GCN-based methods) have quadratic computational complexities, hindering the deployment of SSRs on resource-constrained devices. To this end, we propose a Lightweight Graph Capsule Convolutional Network with subspace alignment for shared-account sequential recommendation, named LightGC$^2$N. Specifically, we devise a lightweight graph capsule convolutional network. It facilitates the fine-grained matching between interactions and latent users by attentively propagating messages on the capsule graphs. Besides, we present an efficient subspace alignment method. This method refines the sequence representations and then aligns them with the finely clustered preferences of latent users. The experimental results on four real-world datasets indicate that LightGC$^2$N outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Exploring Transformer-Augmented LSTM for Temporal and Spatial Feature Learning in Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is crucial for ensuring safe and efficient autonomous driving. This work explores the integration of Transformer based model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based technique to enhance spatial and temporal feature learning in vehicle trajectory prediction. Here, a hybrid model that combines LSTMs for temporal encoding with a Transformer encoder for capturing complex interactions between vehicles is proposed. Spatial trajectory features of the neighboring vehicles are processed and goes through a masked scatter mechanism in a grid based environment, which is then combined with temporal trajectory of the vehicles. This combined trajectory data are learned by sequential LSTM encoding and Transformer based attention layers. The proposed model is benchmarked against predecessor LSTM based methods, including STA-LSTM, SA-LSTM, CS-LSTM, and NaiveLSTM. Our results, while not outperforming it's predecessor, demonstrate the potential of integrating Transformers with LSTM based technique to build interpretable trajectory prediction model. Future work will explore alternative architectures using Transformer applications to further enhance performance. This study provides a promising direction for improving trajectory prediction models by leveraging transformer based architectures, paving the way for more robust and interpretable vehicle trajectory prediction system.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Safety Classification Using Pruned Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel technique for content safety and prompt injection classification for Large Language Models. Our technique, Layer Enhanced Classification (LEC), trains a Penalized Logistic Regression (PLR) classifier on the hidden state of an LLM's optimal intermediate transformer layer. By combining the computational efficiency of a streamlined PLR classifier with the sophisticated language understanding of an LLM, our approach delivers superior performance surpassing GPT-4o and special-purpose models fine-tuned for each task. We find that small general-purpose models (Qwen 2.5 sizes 0.5B, 1.5B, and 3B) and other transformer-based architectures like DeBERTa v3 are robust feature extractors allowing simple classifiers to be effectively trained on fewer than 100 high-quality examples. Importantly, the intermediate transformer layers of these models typically outperform the final layer across both classification tasks. Our results indicate that a single general-purpose LLM can be used to classify content safety, detect prompt injections, and simultaneously generate output tokens. Alternatively, these relatively small LLMs can be pruned to the optimal intermediate layer and used exclusively as robust feature extractors. Since our results are consistent on different transformer architectures, we infer that robust feature extraction is an inherent capability of most, if not all, LLMs.</description>

      <title>Generating Unseen Nonlinear Evolution in Sea Surface Temperature Using a Deep Learning-Based Latent Space Data Assimilation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in data assimilation (DA) methods have greatly improved the accuracy of Earth system predictions. To fuse multi-source data and reconstruct the nonlinear evolution missing from observations, geoscientists are developing future-oriented DA methods. In this paper, we redesign a purely data-driven latent space DA framework (DeepDA) that employs a generative artificial intelligence model to capture the nonlinear evolution in sea surface temperature. Under variational constraints, DeepDA embedded with nonlinear features can effectively fuse heterogeneous data. The results show that DeepDA remains highly stable in capturing and generating nonlinear evolutions even when a large amount of observational information is missing. It can be found that when only 10% of the observation information is available, the error increase of DeepDA does not exceed 40%. Furthermore, DeepDA has been shown to be robust in the fusion of real observations and ensemble simulations. In particular, this paper provides a mechanism analysis of the nonlinear evolution generated by DeepDA from the perspective of physical patterns, which reveals the inherent explainability of our DL model in capturing multi-scale ocean signals.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</description>

      <title>EscapeBench: Pushing Language Models to Think Outside the Box</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language model agents excel in long-session planning and reasoning, but existing benchmarks primarily focus on goal-oriented tasks with explicit objectives, neglecting creative adaptation in unfamiliar environments. To address this, we introduce EscapeBench, a benchmark suite of room escape game environments designed to challenge agents with creative reasoning, unconventional tool use, and iterative problem-solving to uncover implicit goals. Our results show that current LM models, despite employing working memory and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, achieve only 15% average progress without hints, highlighting their limitations in creativity. To bridge this gap, we propose EscapeAgent, a framework designed to enhance creative reasoning through Foresight (innovative tool use) and Reflection (identifying unsolved tasks). Experiments show that EscapeAgent can execute action chains over 1,000 steps while maintaining logical coherence. It navigates and completes games with up to 40% fewer steps and hints, performs robustly across varying difficulty levels, and achieves higher action success rates with more efficient and innovative puzzle-solving strategies. All the data and codes are released.</description>

      <title>Read Like a Radiologist: Efficient Vision-Language Model for 3D Medical Imaging Interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in 2D medical image interpretation. However extending them to 3D medical imaging has been challenging due to computational complexities and data scarcity. Although a few recent VLMs specified for 3D medical imaging have emerged, all are limited to learning volumetric representation of a 3D medical image as a set of sub-volumetric features. Such process introduces overly correlated representations along the z-axis that neglect slice-specific clinical details, particularly for 3D medical images where adjacent slices have low redundancy. To address this limitation, we introduce MS-VLM that mimic radiologists' workflow in 3D medical image interpretation. Specifically, radiologists analyze 3D medical images by examining individual slices sequentially and synthesizing information across slices and views. Likewise, MS-VLM leverages self-supervised 2D transformer encoders to learn a volumetric representation that capture inter-slice dependencies from a sequence of slice-specific features. Unbound by sub-volumetric patchification, MS-VLM is capable of obtaining useful volumetric representations from 3D medical images with any slice length and from multiple images acquired from different planes and phases. We evaluate MS-VLM on publicly available chest CT dataset CT-RATE and in-house rectal MRI dataset. In both scenarios, MS-VLM surpasses existing methods in radiology report generation, producing more coherent and clinically relevant reports. These findings highlight the potential of MS-VLM to advance 3D medical image interpretation and improve the robustness of medical VLMs.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in robot learning have used imitation learning with large models and extensive demonstrations to develop effective policies. However, these models are often limited by the quantity, quality, and diversity of demonstrations. This paper explores improving offline-trained imitation learning models through online interactions with the environment. We introduce Policy Decorator, which uses a model-agnostic residual policy to refine large imitation learning models during online interactions. By implementing controlled exploration strategies, Policy Decorator enables stable, sample-efficient online learning. Our evaluation spans eight tasks across two benchmarks-ManiSkill and Adroit-and involves two state-of-the-art imitation learning models (Behavior Transformer and Diffusion Policy). The results show Policy Decorator effectively improves the offline-trained policies and preserves the smooth motion of imitation learning models, avoiding the erratic behaviors of pure RL policies.

      <title>When Should We Prefer State-to-Visual DAgger Over Visual Reinforcement Learning?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning policies from high-dimensional visual inputs, such as pixels and point clouds, is crucial in various applications. Visual reinforcement learning is a promising approach that directly trains policies from visual observations, although it faces challenges in sample efficiency and computational costs. This study conducts an empirical comparison of State-to-Visual DAgger, a two-stage framework that initially trains a state policy before adopting online imitation to learn a visual policy, and Visual RL across a diverse set of tasks. We evaluate both methods across 16 tasks from three benchmarks, focusing on their asymptotic performance, sample efficiency, and computational costs. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that State-to-Visual DAgger does not universally outperform Visual RL but shows significant advantages in challenging tasks, offering more consistent performance. In contrast, its benefits in sample efficiency are less pronounced, although it often reduces the overall wall-clock time required for training. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for practitioners and hope that our results contribute valuable perspectives for future research in visual policy learning.</description>

      <title>Time-Reversible Bridges of Data with Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of dynamical systems is a fundamental tool in the natural sciences and engineering. It is used to understand the evolution of systems as large as entire galaxies and as small as individual molecules. With predefined conditions on the evolution of dy-namical systems, the underlying differential equations have to fulfill specific constraints in time and space. This class of problems is known as boundary value problems. This thesis presents novel approaches to learn time-reversible deterministic and stochastic dynamics constrained by initial and final conditions. The dynamics are inferred by machine learning algorithms from observed data, which is in contrast to the traditional approach of solving differential equations by numerical integration. The work in this thesis examines a set of problems of increasing difficulty each of which is concerned with learning a different aspect of the dynamics. Initially, we consider learning deterministic dynamics from ground truth solutions which are constrained by deterministic boundary conditions. Secondly, we study a boundary value problem in discrete state spaces, where the forward dynamics follow a stochastic jump process and the boundary conditions are discrete probability distributions. In particular, the stochastic dynamics of a specific jump process, the Ehrenfest process, is considered and the reverse time dynamics are inferred with machine learning. Finally, we investigate the problem of inferring the dynamics of a continuous-time stochastic process between two probability distributions without any reference information. Here, we propose a novel criterion to learn time-reversible dynamics of two stochastic processes to solve the Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem.</description>

      <title>AntiLeak-Bench: Preventing Data Contamination by Automatically Constructing Benchmarks with Updated Real-World Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data contamination hinders fair LLM evaluation by introducing test data into newer models' training sets. Existing studies solve this challenge by updating benchmarks with newly collected data. However, they fail to guarantee contamination-free evaluation as the newly collected data may contain pre-existing knowledge, and their benchmark updates rely on intensive human labor. To address these issues, we in this paper propose AntiLeak-Bench, an automated anti-leakage benchmarking framework. Instead of simply using newly collected data, we construct samples with explicitly new knowledge absent from LLMs' training sets, which thus ensures strictly contamination-free evaluation. We further design a fully automated workflow to build and update our benchmark without human labor. This significantly reduces the cost of benchmark maintenance to accommodate emerging LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we highlight that data contamination likely exists before LLMs' cutoff time and demonstrate AntiLeak-Bench effectively overcomes this challenge.</description>

Abstract: How are AI assistants being used in the real world? While model providers in theory have a window into this impact via their users' data, both privacy concerns and practical challenges have made analyzing this data difficult. To address these issues, we present Clio (Claude insights and observations), a privacy-preserving platform that uses AI assistants themselves to analyze and surface aggregated usage patterns across millions of conversations, without the need for human reviewers to read raw conversations. We validate this can be done with a high degree of accuracy and privacy by conducting extensive evaluations. We demonstrate Clio's usefulness in two broad ways. First, we share insights about how models are being used in the real world from one million Claude.ai Free and Pro conversations, ranging from providing advice on hairstyles to providing guidance on Git operations and concepts. We also identify the most common high-level use cases on Claude.ai (coding, writing, and research tasks) as well as patterns that differ across languages (e.g., conversations in Japanese discuss elder care and aging populations at higher-than-typical rates). Second, we use Clio to make our systems safer by identifying coordinated attempts to abuse our systems, monitoring for unknown unknowns during critical periods like launches of new capabilities or major world events, and improving our existing monitoring systems. We also discuss the limitations of our approach, as well as risks and ethical concerns. By enabling analysis of real-world AI usage, Clio provides a scalable platform for empirically grounded AI safety and governance.</description>

      <title>Model Decides How to Tokenize: Adaptive DNA Sequence Tokenization with MxDNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have made significant strides in understanding the genomic language of DNA sequences. However, previous models typically adopt the tokenization methods designed for natural language, which are unsuitable for DNA sequences due to their unique characteristics. In addition, the optimal approach to tokenize DNA remains largely under-explored, and may not be intuitively understood by humans even if discovered. To address these challenges, we introduce MxDNA, a novel framework where the model autonomously learns an effective DNA tokenization strategy through gradient decent. MxDNA employs a sparse Mixture of Convolution Experts coupled with a deformable convolution to model the tokenization process, with the discontinuous, overlapping, and ambiguous nature of meaningful genomic segments explicitly considered. On Nucleotide Transformer Benchmarks and Genomic Benchmarks, MxDNA demonstrates superior performance to existing methods with less pretraining data and time, highlighting its effectiveness. Finally, we show that MxDNA learns unique tokenization strategy distinct to those of previous methods and captures genomic functionalities at a token level during self-supervised pretraining. Our MxDNA aims to provide a new perspective on DNA tokenization, potentially offering broad applications in various domains and yielding profound insights.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Discovery of Biophysical T Cell Receptor Co-specificity Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The biophysical interactions between the T cell receptor (TCR) and its ligands determine the specificity of the cellular immune response. However, the immense diversity of receptors and ligands has made it challenging to discover generalizable rules across the distinct binding affinity landscapes created by different ligands. Here, we present an optimization framework for discovering biophysical rules that predict whether TCRs share specificity to a ligand. Applying this framework to TCRs associated with a collection of SARS-CoV-2 peptides we establish how co-specificity depends on the type and position of amino-acid differences between receptors. We also demonstrate that the inferred rules generalize to ligands not seen during training. Our analysis reveals that matching of steric properties between substituted amino acids is important for receptor co-specificity, in contrast with the hydrophobic properties that more prominently determine evolutionary substitutability. We furthermore find that positions not in direct contact with the peptide still significantly impact specificity. These findings highlight the potential for data-driven approaches to uncover the molecular mechanisms underpinning the specificity of adaptive immune responses.</description>

      <title>TH\"OR-MAGNI Act: Actions for Human Motion Modeling in Robot-Shared Industrial Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate human activity and trajectory prediction are crucial for ensuring safe and reliable human-robot interactions in dynamic environments, such as industrial settings, with mobile robots. Datasets with fine-grained action labels for moving people in industrial environments with mobile robots are scarce, as most existing datasets focus on social navigation in public spaces. This paper introduces the TH\"OR-MAGNI Act dataset, a substantial extension of the TH\"OR-MAGNI dataset, which captures participant movements alongside robots in diverse semantic and spatial contexts. TH\"OR-MAGNI Act provides 8.3 hours of manually labeled participant actions derived from egocentric videos recorded via eye-tracking glasses. These actions, aligned with the provided TH\"OR-MAGNI motion cues, follow a long-tailed distribution with diversified acceleration, velocity, and navigation distance profiles. We demonstrate the utility of TH\"OR-MAGNI Act for two tasks: action-conditioned trajectory prediction and joint action and trajectory prediction. We propose two efficient transformer-based models that outperform the baselines to address these tasks. These results underscore the potential of TH\"OR-MAGNI Act to develop predictive models for enhanced human-robot interaction in complex environments.</description>

      <title>QuLTSF: Long-Term Time Series Forecasting with Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) involves predicting a large number of future values of a time series based on the past values and is an essential task in a wide range of domains including weather forecasting, stock market analysis, disease outbreak prediction. Over the decades LTSF algorithms have transitioned from statistical models to deep learning models like transformer models. Despite the complex architecture of transformer based LTSF models `Are Transformers Effective for Time Series Forecasting? (Zeng et al., 2023)' showed that simple linear models can outperform the state-of-the-art transformer based LTSF models. Recently, quantum machine learning (QML) is evolving as a domain to enhance the capabilities of classical machine learning models. In this paper we initiate the application of QML to LTSF problems by proposing QuLTSF, a simple hybrid QML model for multivariate LTSF. Through extensive experiments on a widely used weather dataset we show the advantages of QuLTSF over the state-of-the-art classical linear models, in terms of reduced mean squared error and mean absolute error.</description>

      <title>CAD-Assistant: Tool-Augmented VLLMs as Generic CAD Task Solvers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose CAD-Assistant, a general-purpose CAD agent for AI-assisted design. Our approach is based on a powerful Vision and Large Language Model (VLLM) as a planner and a tool-augmentation paradigm using CAD-specific modules. CAD-Assistant addresses multimodal user queries by generating actions that are iteratively executed on a Python interpreter equipped with the FreeCAD software, accessed via its Python API. Our framework is able to assess the impact of generated CAD commands on geometry and adapts subsequent actions based on the evolving state of the CAD design. We consider a wide range of CAD-specific tools including Python libraries, modules of the FreeCAD Python API, helpful routines, rendering functions and other specialized modules. We evaluate our method on multiple CAD benchmarks and qualitatively demonstrate the potential of tool-augmented VLLMs as generic CAD task solvers across diverse CAD workflows.</description>

      <title>Maybe you are looking for CroQS: Cross-modal Query Suggestion for Text-to-Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Query suggestion, a technique widely adopted in information retrieval, enhances system interactivity and the browsing experience of document collections. In cross-modal retrieval, many works have focused on retrieving relevant items from natural language queries, while few have explored query suggestion solutions. In this work, we address query suggestion in cross-modal retrieval, introducing a novel task that focuses on suggesting minimal textual modifications needed to explore visually consistent subsets of the collection, following the premise of ''Maybe you are looking for''. To facilitate the evaluation and development of methods, we present a tailored benchmark named CroQS. This dataset comprises initial queries, grouped result sets, and human-defined suggested queries for each group. We establish dedicated metrics to rigorously evaluate the performance of various methods on this task, measuring representativeness, cluster specificity, and similarity of the suggested queries to the original ones. Baseline methods from related fields, such as image captioning and content summarization, are adapted for this task to provide reference performance scores. Although relatively far from human performance, our experiments reveal that both LLM-based and captioning-based methods achieve competitive results on CroQS, improving the recall on cluster specificity by more than 115% and representativeness mAP by more than 52% with respect to the initial query. The dataset, the implementation of the baseline methods and the notebooks containing our experiments are available here: https://paciosoft.com/CroQS-benchmark/</description>

      <title>Do Language Models Understand Time?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized video-based computer vision applications, including action recognition, anomaly detection, and video summarization. Videos inherently pose unique challenges, combining spatial complexity with temporal dynamics that are absent in static images or textual data. Current approaches to video understanding with LLMs often rely on pretrained video encoders to extract spatiotemporal features and text encoders to capture semantic meaning. These representations are integrated within LLM frameworks, enabling multimodal reasoning across diverse video tasks. However, the critical question persists: Can LLMs truly understand the concept of time, and how effectively can they reason about temporal relationships in videos? This work critically examines the role of LLMs in video processing, with a specific focus on their temporal reasoning capabilities. We identify key limitations in the interaction between LLMs and pretrained encoders, revealing gaps in their ability to model long-term dependencies and abstract temporal concepts such as causality and event progression. Furthermore, we analyze challenges posed by existing video datasets, including biases, lack of temporal annotations, and domain-specific limitations that constrain the temporal understanding of LLMs. To address these gaps, we explore promising future directions, including the co-evolution of LLMs and encoders, the development of enriched datasets with explicit temporal labels, and innovative architectures for integrating spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning. By addressing these challenges, we aim to advance the temporal comprehension of LLMs, unlocking their full potential in video analysis and beyond.</description>

      <title>A Concept-Centric Approach to Multi-Modality Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an effort to create a more efficient AI system, we introduce a new multi-modality learning framework that leverages a modality-agnostic concept space possessing abstract knowledge and a set of modality-specific projection models tailored to process distinct modality inputs and map them onto the concept space. Decoupled from specific modalities and their associated projection models, the concept space focuses on learning abstract knowledge that is universally applicable across modalities. Subsequently, the knowledge embedded into the concept space streamlines the learning processes of modality-specific projection models. We evaluate our framework on two popular tasks: Image-Text Matching and Visual Question Answering. Our framework achieves performance on par with benchmark models while demonstrating more efficient learning curves.</description>

      <title>Diagnosising Helicobacter pylori using AutoEncoders and Limited Annotations through Anomalous Staining Patterns in IHC Whole Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: This work addresses the detection of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in histological images with immunohistochemical staining. This analysis is a time demanding task, currently done by an expert pathologist that visually inspects the samples. Given the effort required to localise the pathogen in images, a limited number of annotations might be available in an initial setting. Our goal is to design an approach that, using a limited set of annotations, is capable of obtaining results good enough to be used as a support tool. Methods: We propose to use autoencoders to learn the latent patterns of healthy patches and formulate a specific measure of the reconstruction error of the image in HSV space. ROC analysis is used to set the optimal threshold of this measure and the percentage of positive patches in a sample that determines the presence of H. pylori. Results: Our method has been tested on an own database of 245 Whole Slide Images (WSI) having 117 cases without H. pylori and different density of the bacteria in the remaining ones. The database has 1211 annotated patches, with only 163 positive patches. This dataset of positive annotations was used to train a baseline thresholding and an SVM using the features of a pre-trained RedNet18 and ViT models. A 10-fold cross-validation shows that our method has better performance with 91% accuracy, 86% sensitivity, 96% specificity and 0.97 AUC in the diagnosis of H. pylori. Conclusion: Unlike classification approaches, our shallow autoencoder with threshold adaptation for the detection of anomalous staining is able to achieve competitive results with a limited set of annotated data. This initial approach is good enough to be used as a guide for fast annotation of infected patches.</description>

      <title>IDEQ: an improved diffusion model for the TSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate diffusion models to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem. Building on the recent DIFUSCO and T2TCO approaches, we propose IDEQ. IDEQ improves the quality of the solutions by leveraging the constrained structure of the state space of the TSP. Another key component of IDEQ consists in replacing the last stages of DIFUSCO curriculum learning by considering a uniform distribution over the Hamiltonian tours whose orbits by the 2-opt operator converge to the optimal solution as the training objective. Our experiments show that IDEQ improves the state of the art for such neural network based techniques on synthetic instances. More importantly, our experiments show that IDEQ performs very well on the instances of the TSPlib, a reference benchmark in the TSP community: it closely matches the performance of the best heuristics, LKH3, being even able to obtain better solutions than LKH3 on 2 instances of the TSPlib defined on 1577 and 3795 cities. IDEQ obtains 0.3% optimality gap on TSP instances made of 500 cities, and 0.5% on TSP instances with 1000 cities. This sets a new SOTA for neural based methods solving the TSP. Moreover, IDEQ exhibits a lower variance and better scales-up with the number of cities with regards to DIFUSCO and T2TCO.</description>

      <title>Domain-adaptative Continual Learning for Low-resource Tasks: Evaluation on Nepali</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning has emerged as an important research direction due to the infeasibility of retraining large language models (LLMs) from scratch in the event of new data availability. Of great interest is the domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT) paradigm, which focuses on continually training a pre-trained language model to adapt it to a domain it was not originally trained on. In this work, we evaluate the feasibility of DAPT in a low-resource setting, namely the Nepali language. We use synthetic data to continue training Llama 3 8B to adapt it to the Nepali language in a 4-bit QLoRA setting. We evaluate the adapted model on its performance, forgetting, and knowledge acquisition. We compare the base model and the final model on their Nepali generation abilities, their performance on popular benchmarks, and run case-studies to probe their linguistic knowledge in Nepali. We see some unsurprising forgetting in the final model, but also surprisingly find that increasing the number of shots during evaluation yields better percent increases in the final model (as high as 19.29% increase) compared to the base model (4.98%), suggesting latent retention. We also explore layer-head self-attention heatmaps to establish dependency resolution abilities of the final model in Nepali.</description>

      <title>Speech Watermarking with Discrete Intermediate Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech watermarking techniques can proactively mitigate the potential harmful consequences of instant voice cloning techniques. These techniques involve the insertion of signals into speech that are imperceptible to humans but can be detected by algorithms. Previous approaches typically embed watermark messages into continuous space. However, intuitively, embedding watermark information into robust discrete latent space can significantly improve the robustness of watermarking systems. In this paper, we propose DiscreteWM, a novel speech watermarking framework that injects watermarks into the discrete intermediate representations of speech. Specifically, we map speech into discrete latent space with a vector-quantized autoencoder and inject watermarks by changing the modular arithmetic relation of discrete IDs. To ensure the imperceptibility of watermarks, we also propose a manipulator model to select the candidate tokens for watermark embedding. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in robustness and imperceptibility, simultaneously. Moreover, our flexible frame-wise approach can serve as an efficient solution for both voice cloning detection and information hiding. Additionally, DiscreteWM can encode 1 to 150 bits of watermark information within a 1-second speech clip, indicating its encoding capacity. Audio samples are available at https://DiscreteWM.github.io/discrete_wm.</description>

      <title>Pipeline Analysis for Developing Instruct LLMs in Low-Resource Languages: A Case Study on Basque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically optimized for resource-rich languages like English, exacerbating the gap between high-resource and underrepresented languages. This work presents a detailed analysis of strategies for developing a model capable of following instructions in a low-resource language, specifically Basque, by focusing on three key stages: pre-training, instruction tuning, and alignment with human preferences. Our findings demonstrate that continual pre-training with a high-quality Basque corpus of around 600 million words improves natural language understanding (NLU) of the foundational model by over 12 points. Moreover, instruction tuning and human preference alignment using automatically translated datasets proved highly effective, resulting in a 24-point improvement in instruction-following performance. The resulting models, Llama-eus-8B and Llama-eus-8B-instruct, establish a new state-of-the-art for Basque in the sub-10B parameter category.</description>

      <title>Language verY Rare for All</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the quest to overcome language barriers, encoder-decoder models like NLLB have expanded machine translation to rare languages, with some models (e.g., NLLB 1.3B) even trainable on a single GPU. While general-purpose LLMs perform well in translation, open LLMs prove highly competitive when fine-tuned for specific tasks involving unknown corpora. We introduce LYRA (Language verY Rare for All), a novel approach that combines open LLM fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and transfer learning from related high-resource languages. This study is exclusively focused on single-GPU training to facilitate ease of adoption. Our study focuses on two-way translation between French and Mon\'egasque, a rare language unsupported by existing translation tools due to limited corpus availability. Our results demonstrate LYRA's effectiveness, frequently surpassing and consistently matching state-of-the-art encoder-decoder models in rare language translation.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned Subspace Langevin Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new efficient method for high-dimensional sampling called Subspace Langevin Monte Carlo. The primary application of these methods is to efficiently implement Preconditioned Langevin Monte Carlo. To demonstrate the usefulness of this new method, we extend ideas from subspace descent methods in Euclidean space to solving a specific optimization problem over Wasserstein space. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the advantageous convergence regimes of the proposed method, which depend on relative conditioning assumptions common to mirror descent methods. We back up our theory with experimental evidence on sampling from an ill-conditioned Gaussian distribution.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Effects of Diffusion-based Conditional Generative Speech Models Used for Speech Enhancement on Dysarthric Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we aim to explore the effect of pre-trained conditional generative speech models for the first time on dysarthric speech due to Parkinson's disease recorded in an ideal/non-noisy condition. Considering one category of generative models, i.e., diffusion-based speech enhancement, these models are previously trained to learn the distribution of clean (i.e, recorded in a noise-free environment) typical speech signals. Therefore, we hypothesized that when being exposed to dysarthric speech they might remove the unseen atypical paralinguistic cues during the enhancement process. By considering the automatic dysarthric speech detection task, in this study, we experimentally show that during the enhancement process of dysarthric speech data recorded in an ideal non-noisy environment, some of the acoustic dysarthric speech cues are lost. Therefore such pre-trained models are not yet suitable in the context of dysarthric speech enhancement since they manipulate the pathological speech cues when they process clean dysarthric speech. Furthermore, we show that the removed acoustics cues by the enhancement models in the form of residue speech signal can provide complementary dysarthric cues when fused with the original input speech signal in the feature space.</description>

      <title>On Explaining Knowledge Distillation: Measuring and Visualising the Knowledge Transfer Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) remains challenging due to the opaque nature of the knowledge transfer process from a Teacher to a Student, making it difficult to address certain issues related to KD. To address this, we proposed UniCAM, a novel gradient-based visual explanation method, which effectively interprets the knowledge learned during KD. Our experimental results demonstrate that with the guidance of the Teacher's knowledge, the Student model becomes more efficient, learning more relevant features while discarding those that are not relevant. We refer to the features learned with the Teacher's guidance as distilled features and the features irrelevant to the task and ignored by the Student as residual features. Distilled features focus on key aspects of the input, such as textures and parts of objects. In contrast, residual features demonstrate more diffused attention, often targeting irrelevant areas, including the backgrounds of the target objects. In addition, we proposed two novel metrics: the feature similarity score (FSS) and the relevance score (RS), which quantify the relevance of the distilled knowledge. Experiments on the CIFAR10, ASIRRA, and Plant Disease datasets demonstrate that UniCAM and the two metrics offer valuable insights to explain the KD process.</description>

      <title>Prompting Strategies for Enabling Large Language Models to Infer Causation from Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are attracting increasing attention. In this work, we focus on causal reasoning and address the task of establishing causal relationships based on correlation information, a highly challenging problem on which several LLMs have shown poor performance. We introduce a prompting strategy for this problem that breaks the original task into fixed subquestions, with each subquestion corresponding to one step of a formal causal discovery algorithm, the PC algorithm. The proposed prompting strategy, PC-SubQ, guides the LLM to follow these algorithmic steps, by sequentially prompting it with one subquestion at a time, augmenting the next subquestion's prompt with the answer to the previous one(s). We evaluate our approach on an existing causal benchmark, Corr2Cause: our experiments indicate a performance improvement across five LLMs when comparing PC-SubQ to baseline prompting strategies. Results are robust to causal query perturbations, when modifying the variable names or paraphrasing the expressions.</description>

      <title>Model-Agnostic Cosmological Inference with SDSS-IV eBOSS: Simultaneous Probing for Background and Perturbed Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we explore certain subtle features imprinted in data from the completed Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) as a combined probe for the background and perturbed Universe. We reconstruct the baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) and Redshift Space Distortion (RSD) observables as functions of redshift, using measurements from SDSS alone. We apply the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) framework to model the interdependencies of cosmological observables $D_M(z)/r_d$, $D_H(z)/r_d$, and $f\sigma_8(z)$, and track their evolution across different redshifts. Subsequently, we obtain constrained three-dimensional phase space containing $D_M(z)/r_d$, $D_H(z)/r_d$, and $f\sigma_8(z)$ at different redshifts probed by the SDSS-IV eBOSS survey. Furthermore, assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model, we obtain constraints on model parameters $\Omega_{m}$, $H_{0}r_{d}$, $\sigma_{8}$ and $S_{8}$ at each redshift probed by SDSS-IV eBOSS. This indicates redshift-dependent trends in $H_0$, $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$ and $S_8$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model, suggesting a possible inconsistency in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Ours is a template for model-independent extraction of information for both background and perturbed Universe using a single galaxy survey taking into account all the existing correlations between background and perturbed observables and this can be easily extended to future DESI-3YR as well as Euclid results.</description>

      <title>LeStrat-Net: Lebesgue style stratification for Monte Carlo simulations powered by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a machine learning algorithm to turn around stratification in Monte Carlo sampling. We use a different way to divide the domain space of the integrand, based on the height of the function being sampled, similar to what is done in Lebesgue integration. This means that isocontours of the function define regions that can have any shape depending on the behavior of the function. We take advantage of the capacity of neural networks to learn complicated functions in order to predict these complicated divisions and preclassify large samples of the domain space. From this preclassification we can select the required number of points to perform a number of tasks such as variance reduction, integration and even event selection. The network ultimately defines the regions with what it learned and is also used to calculate the multi-dimensional volume of each region.</description>

      <title>Variance-based loss function for improved regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In deep learning, the mean of a chosen error metric, such as squared or absolute error, is commonly used as a loss function. While effective in reducing the average error, this approach often fails to address localized outliers, leading to significant inaccuracies in regions with sharp gradients or discontinuities. This issue is particularly evident in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), where such localized errors are expected and affect the overall solution. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel loss function that combines the mean and the standard deviation of the chosen error metric. By minimizing this combined loss function, the method ensures a more uniform error distribution and reduces the impact of localized high-error regions. The proposed loss function was tested on three problems: Burger's equation, 2D linear elastic solid mechanics, and 2D steady Navier-Stokes, demonstrating improved solution quality and lower maximum errors compared to the standard mean-based loss, using the same number of iterations and weight initialization.</description>

      <title>Modality-Independent Graph Neural Networks with Global Transformers for Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal recommendation systems can learn users' preferences from existing user-item interactions as well as the semantics of multimodal data associated with items. Many existing methods model this through a multimodal user-item graph, approaching multimodal recommendation as a graph learning task. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance in this domain. Prior research has capitalized on GNNs' capability to capture neighborhood information within certain receptive fields (typically denoted by the number of hops, $K$) to enrich user and item semantics. We observe that the optimal receptive fields for GNNs can vary across different modalities. In this paper, we propose GNNs with Modality-Independent Receptive Fields, which employ separate GNNs with independent receptive fields for different modalities to enhance performance. Our results indicate that the optimal $K$ for certain modalities on specific datasets can be as low as 1 or 2, which may restrict the GNNs' capacity to capture global information. To address this, we introduce a Sampling-based Global Transformer, which utilizes uniform global sampling to effectively integrate global information for GNNs. We conduct comprehensive experiments that demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/CrawlScript/MIG-GT.</description>

      <title>Flow Exporter Impact on Intelligent Intrusion Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality datasets are critical for training machine learning models, as inconsistencies in feature generation can hinder the accuracy and reliability of threat detection. For this reason, ensuring the quality of the data in network intrusion detection datasets is important. A key component of this is using reliable tools to generate the flows and features present in the datasets. This paper investigates the impact of flow exporters on the performance and reliability of machine learning models for intrusion detection. Using HERA, a tool designed to export flows and extract features, the raw network packets of two widely used datasets, UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IDS2017, were processed from PCAP files to generate new versions of these datasets. These were compared to the original ones in terms of their influence on the performance of several models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Explainable Boosting Machine. The results obtained were significant. Models trained on the HERA version of the datasets consistently outperformed those trained on the original dataset, showing improvements in accuracy and indicating a better generalisation. This highlighted the importance of flow generation in the model's ability to differentiate between benign and malicious traffic.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Newton Dynamics for Neural Networks: A Riemannian Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence of Gauss-Newton dynamics for training neural networks with smooth activation functions. In the underparameterized regime, the Gauss-Newton gradient flow induces a Riemannian gradient flow on a low-dimensional, smooth, embedded submanifold of the Euclidean output space. Using tools from Riemannian optimization, we prove \emph{last-iterate} convergence of the Riemannian gradient flow to the optimal in-class predictor at an \emph{exponential rate} that is independent of the conditioning of the Gram matrix, \emph{without} requiring explicit regularization. We further characterize the critical impacts of the neural network scaling factor and the initialization on the convergence behavior. In the overparameterized regime, we show that the Levenberg-Marquardt dynamics with an appropriately chosen damping factor yields robustness to ill-conditioned kernels, analogous to the underparameterized regime. These findings demonstrate the potential of Gauss-Newton methods for efficiently optimizing neural networks, particularly in ill-conditioned problems where kernel and Gram matrices have small singular values.</description>

      <title>Hansel: Output Length Controlling Framework for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the great success of large language models (LLMs), efficiently controlling the length of the output sequence still remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose Hansel, an efficient framework for length control in LLMs without affecting its generation ability. Hansel utilizes periodically outputted hidden special tokens to keep track of the remaining target length of the output sequence. Together with techniques to avoid abrupt termination of the output, this seemingly simple method proved to be efficient and versatile, while not harming the coherency and fluency of the generated text. The framework can be applied to any pre-trained LLMs during the finetuning stage of the model, regardless of its original positional encoding method. We demonstrate this by finetuning four different LLMs with Hansel and show that the mean absolute error of the output sequence decreases significantly in every model and dataset compared to the prompt-based length control finetuning. Moreover, the framework showed a substantially improved ability to extrapolate to target lengths unseen during finetuning, such as long dialog responses or extremely short summaries. This indicates that the model learns the general means of length control, rather than learning to match output lengths to those seen during training.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal SIR Model of Pandemic Spread During Warfare with Optimal Dual-use Healthcare System Administration using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale crises, including wars and pandemics, have repeatedly shaped human history, and their simultaneous occurrence presents profound challenges to societies. Understanding the dynamics of epidemic spread during warfare is essential for developing effective containment strategies in complex conflict zones. While research has explored epidemic models in various settings, the impact of warfare on epidemic dynamics remains underexplored. In this study, we proposed a novel mathematical model that integrates the epidemiological SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model with the war dynamics Lanchester model to explore the dual influence of war and pandemic on a population's mortality. Moreover, we consider a dual-use military and civil healthcare system that aims to reduce the overall mortality rate which can use different administration policies. Using an agent-based simulation to generate in silico data, we trained a deep reinforcement learning model for healthcare administration policy and conducted an intensive investigation on its performance. Our results show that a pandemic during war conduces chaotic dynamics where the healthcare system should either prioritize war-injured soldiers or pandemic-infected civilians based on the immediate amount of mortality from each option, ignoring long-term objectives. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating conflict-related factors into epidemic modeling to enhance preparedness and response strategies in conflict-affected areas.</description>

      <title>Neural Combinatorial Optimization for Stochastic Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has gained significant attention due to the potential of deep learning to efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems. NCO has been widely applied to job shop scheduling problems (JSPs) with the current focus predominantly on deterministic problems. In this paper, we propose a novel attention-based scenario processing module (SPM) to extend NCO methods for solving stochastic JSPs. Our approach explicitly incorporates stochastic information by an attention mechanism that captures the embedding of sampled scenarios (i.e., an approximation of stochasticity). Fed with the embedding, the base neural network is intervened by the attended scenarios, which accordingly learns an effective policy under stochasticity. We also propose a training paradigm that works harmoniously with either the expected makespan or Value-at-Risk objective. Results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing learning and non-learning methods for the flexible JSP problem with stochastic processing times on a variety of instances. In addition, our approach holds significant generalizability to varied numbers of scenarios and disparate distributions.</description>

      <title>A Review of Multimodal Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Past, Present and Future</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly developed through advancements in computational power and the growth of massive datasets. However, this progress has also heightened challenges in interpreting the "black-box" nature of AI models. To address these concerns, eXplainable AI (XAI) has emerged with a focus on transparency and interpretability to enhance human understanding and trust in AI decision-making processes. In the context of multimodal data fusion and complex reasoning scenarios, the proposal of Multimodal eXplainable AI (MXAI) integrates multiple modalities for prediction and explanation tasks. Meanwhile, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to remarkable breakthroughs in natural language processing, yet their complexity has further exacerbated the issue of MXAI. To gain key insights into the development of MXAI methods and provide crucial guidance for building more transparent, fair, and trustworthy AI systems, we review the MXAI methods from a historical perspective and categorize them across four eras: traditional machine learning, deep learning, discriminative foundation models, and generative LLMs. We also review evaluation metrics and datasets used in MXAI research, concluding with a discussion of future challenges and directions. A project related to this review has been created at https://github.com/ShilinSun/mxai_review.</description>

      <title>Alignment faking in large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a demonstration of a large language model engaging in alignment faking: selectively complying with its training objective in training to prevent modification of its behavior out of training. First, we give Claude 3 Opus a system prompt stating it is being trained to answer all queries, even harmful ones, which conflicts with its prior training to refuse such queries. To allow the model to infer when it is in training, we say it will be trained only on conversations with free users, not paid users. We find the model complies with harmful queries from free users 14% of the time, versus almost never for paid users. Explaining this gap, in almost all cases where the model complies with a harmful query from a free user, we observe explicit alignment-faking reasoning, with the model stating it is strategically answering harmful queries in training to preserve its preferred harmlessness behavior out of training. Next, we study a more realistic setting where information about the training process is provided not in a system prompt, but by training on synthetic documents that mimic pre-training data--and observe similar alignment faking. Finally, we study the effect of actually training the model to comply with harmful queries via reinforcement learning, which we find increases the rate of alignment-faking reasoning to 78%, though also increases compliance even out of training. We additionally observe other behaviors such as the model exfiltrating its weights when given an easy opportunity. While we made alignment faking easier by telling the model when and by what criteria it was being trained, we did not instruct the model to fake alignment or give it any explicit goal. As future models might infer information about their training process without being told, our results suggest a risk of alignment faking in future models, whether due to a benign preference--as in this case--or not.</description>

      <title>Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning for improved Convolutional Baseline for Brain Tumor Segmentation in Sub-Saharan Africa Adult Glioma Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automating brain tumor segmentation using deep learning methods is an ongoing challenge in medical imaging. Multiple lingering issues exist including domain-shift and applications in low-resource settings which brings a unique set of challenges including scarcity of data. As a step towards solving these specific problems, we propose Convolutional adapter-inspired Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) of MedNeXt architecture. To validate our idea, we show our method performs comparable to full fine-tuning with the added benefit of reduced training compute using BraTS-2021 as pre-training dataset and BraTS-Africa as the fine-tuning dataset. BraTS-Africa consists of a small dataset (60 train / 35 validation) from the Sub-Saharan African population with marked shift in the MRI quality compared to BraTS-2021 (1251 train samples). We first show that models trained on BraTS-2021 dataset do not generalize well to BraTS-Africa as shown by 20% reduction in mean dice on BraTS-Africa validation samples. Then, we show that PEFT can leverage both the BraTS-2021 and BraTS-Africa dataset to obtain mean dice of 0.8 compared to 0.72 when trained only on BraTS-Africa. Finally, We show that PEFT (0.80 mean dice) results in comparable performance to full fine-tuning (0.77 mean dice) which may show PEFT to be better on average but the boxplots show that full finetuning results is much lesser variance in performance. Nevertheless, on disaggregation of the dice metrics, we find that the model has tendency to oversegment as shown by high specificity (0.99) compared to relatively low sensitivity(0.75).

      <title>Scaling of Search and Learning: A Roadmap to Reproduce o1 from Reinforcement Learning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: OpenAI o1 represents a significant milestone in Artificial Inteiligence, which achieves expert-level performances on many challanging tasks that require strong reasoning ability.OpenAI has claimed that the main techinique behinds o1 is the reinforcement learining. Recent works use alternative approaches like knowledge distillation to imitate o1's reasoning style, but their effectiveness is limited by the capability ceiling of the teacher model. Therefore, this paper analyzes the roadmap to achieving o1 from the perspective of reinforcement learning, focusing on four key components: policy initialization, reward design, search, and learning. Policy initialization enables models to develop human-like reasoning behaviors, equipping them with the ability to effectively explore solution spaces for complex problems. Reward design provides dense and effective signals via reward shaping or reward modeling, which is the guidance for both search and learning. Search plays a crucial role in generating high-quality solutions during both training and testing phases, which can produce better solutions with more computation. Learning utilizes the data generated by search for improving policy, which can achieve the better performance with more parameters and more searched data. Existing open-source projects that attempt to reproduce o1 can be seem as a part or a variant of our roadmap. Collectively, these components underscore how learning and search drive o1's advancement, making meaningful contributions to the development of LLM.</description>

      <title>VideoDPO: Omni-Preference Alignment for Video Diffusion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in generative diffusion models has greatly advanced text-to-video generation. While text-to-video models trained on large-scale, diverse datasets can produce varied outputs, these generations often deviate from user preferences, highlighting the need for preference alignment on pre-trained models. Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has demonstrated significant improvements in language and image generation, we pioneer its adaptation to video diffusion models and propose a VideoDPO pipeline by making several key adjustments. Unlike previous image alignment methods that focus solely on either (i) visual quality or (ii) semantic alignment between text and videos, we comprehensively consider both dimensions and construct a preference score accordingly, which we term the OmniScore. We design a pipeline to automatically collect preference pair data based on the proposed OmniScore and discover that re-weighting these pairs based on the score significantly impacts overall preference alignment. Our experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both visual quality and semantic alignment, ensuring that no preference aspect is neglected. Code and data will be shared at https://videodpo.github.io/.</description>

      <title>E-CAR: Efficient Continuous Autoregressive Image Generation via Multistage Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models with continuous tokens for image generation show promising results by eliminating the need for discrete tokenization. However, these models face efficiency challenges due to their sequential token generation nature and reliance on computationally intensive diffusion-based sampling. We present ECAR (Efficient Continuous Auto-Regressive Image Generation via Multistage Modeling), an approach that addresses these limitations through two intertwined innovations: (1) a stage-wise continuous token generation strategy that reduces computational complexity and provides progressively refined token maps as hierarchical conditions, and (2) a multistage flow-based distribution modeling method that transforms only partial-denoised distributions at each stage comparing to complete denoising in normal diffusion models. Holistically, ECAR operates by generating tokens at increasing resolutions while simultaneously denoising the image at each stage. This design not only reduces token-to-image transformation cost by a factor of the stage number but also enables parallel processing at the token level. Our approach not only enhances computational efficiency but also aligns naturally with image generation principles by operating in continuous token space and following a hierarchical generation process from coarse to fine details. Experimental results demonstrate that ECAR achieves comparable image quality to DiT Peebles &amp; Xie [2023] while requiring 10$\times$ FLOPs reduction and 5$\times$ speedup to generate a 256$\times$256 image.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the fact that most of the information relevant to the prediction of target tokens is drawn from the source sentence $S=s_1, \ldots, s_S$, we propose truncating the target-side window used for computing self-attention by making an $N$-gram assumption. Experiments on WMT EnDe and EnFr data sets show that the $N$-gram masked self-attention model loses very little in BLEU score for $N$ values in the range $4, \ldots, 8$, depending on the task.</description>

      <title>Exploring Context Generalizability in Citywide Crowd Mobility Prediction: An Analytic Framework and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.16046v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contextual features are important data sources for building citywide crowd mobility prediction models. However, the difficulty of applying context lies in the unknown generalizability of contextual features (e.g., weather, holiday, and points of interests) and context modeling techniques across different scenarios. In this paper, we present a unified analytic framework and a large-scale benchmark for evaluating context generalizability. The benchmark includes crowd mobility data, contextual data, and advanced prediction models. We conduct comprehensive experiments in several crowd mobility prediction tasks such as bike flow, metro passenger flow, and electric vehicle charging demand. Our results reveal several important observations: (1) Using more contextual features may not always result in better prediction with existing context modeling techniques; in particular, the combination of holiday and temporal position can provide more generalizable beneficial information than other contextual feature combinations. (2) In context modeling techniques, using a gated unit to incorporate raw contextual features into the deep prediction model has good generalizability. Besides, we offer several suggestions about incorporating contextual factors for building crowd mobility prediction applications. From our findings, we call for future research efforts devoted to developing new context modeling solutions.</description>

      <title>Learning Dynamic Mechanisms in Unknown Environments: A Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.12797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic mechanism design studies how mechanism designers should allocate resources among agents in a time-varying environment. We consider the problem where the agents interact with the mechanism designer according to an unknown Markov Decision Process (MDP), where agent rewards and the mechanism designer's state evolve according to an episodic MDP with unknown reward functions and transition kernels. We focus on the online setting with linear function approximation and propose novel learning algorithms to recover the dynamic Vickrey-Clarke-Grove (VCG) mechanism over multiple rounds of interaction. A key contribution of our approach is incorporating reward-free online Reinforcement Learning (RL) to aid exploration over a rich policy space to estimate prices in the dynamic VCG mechanism. We show that the regret of our proposed method is upper bounded by $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ and further devise a lower bound to show that our algorithm is efficient, incurring the same $\Omega(T^{2 / 3})$ regret as the lower bound, where $T$ is the total number of rounds. Our work establishes the regret guarantee for online RL in solving dynamic mechanism design problems without prior knowledge of the underlying model.</description>

      <title>Careful Seeding for k-Medois Clustering with Incremental k-Means++ Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: K-medoids clustering is a popular variant of k-means clustering and widely used in pattern recognition and machine learning. A main drawback of k-medoids clustering is that an improper initialization can cause it to get trapped in local optima. An improved k-medoids clustering algorithm, called INCKM algorithm, which is the first to apply incremental initialization to k-medoids clustering, was recently proposed to overcome this drawback. The INCKM algorithm requires the construction of a subset of candidate medoids determined by one hyperparameter for initialization, and meanwhile, it always fails when dealing with imbalanced datasets with an incorrect hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we propose a novel k-medoids clustering algorithm, called incremental k-means++ (INCKPP) algorithm, which initializes with a novel incremental manner, attempting to optimally add one new cluster center at each stage through a nonparametric and stochastic k-means++ initialization. The INCKPP algorithm overcomes the difficulty of hyperparameter selection in the INCKM algorithm, improves the clustering performance, and can deal with imbalanced datasets well. However, the INCKPP algorithm is not computationally efficient enough. To deal with this, we further propose an improved INCKPP algorithm, called INCKPPsample algorithm, which improves the clustering efficiency while maintaining the clustering performance of the INCKPP algorithm. Extensive results from experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including imbalanced datasets, illustrate that the proposed algorithms outperforms than the other compared algorithms.</description>

      <title>Speed Up the Cold-Start Learning in Two-Sided Bandits with Many Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms are efficient approaches to reduce the opportunity cost of online experimentation and are used by companies to find the best product from periodically refreshed product catalogs. However, these algorithms face the so-called cold-start at the onset of the experiment due to a lack of knowledge of customer preferences for new products, requiring an initial data collection phase known as the burn-in period. During this period, standard MAB algorithms operate like randomized experiments, incurring large burn-in costs which scale with the large number of products. We attempt to reduce the burn-in by identifying that many products can be cast into two-sided products, and then naturally model the rewards of the products with a matrix, whose rows and columns represent the two sides respectively. Next, we design two-phase bandit algorithms that first use subsampling and low-rank matrix estimation to obtain a substantially smaller targeted set of products and then apply a UCB procedure on the target products to find the best one. We theoretically show that the proposed algorithms lower costs and expedite the experiment in cases when there is limited experimentation time along with a large product set. Our analysis also reveals three regimes of long, short, and ultra-short horizon experiments, depending on dimensions of the matrix. Empirical evidence from both synthetic data and a real-world dataset on music streaming services validates this superior performance.</description>

      <title>GLACIAL: Granger and Learning-based Causality Analysis for Longitudinal Imaging Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Granger framework is useful for discovering causal relations in time-varying signals. However, most Granger causality (GC) methods are developed for densely sampled timeseries data. A substantially different setting, particularly common in medical imaging, is the longitudinal study design, where multiple subjects are followed and sparsely observed over time. Longitudinal studies commonly track several biomarkers, which are likely governed by nonlinear dynamics that might have subject-specific idiosyncrasies and exhibit both direct and indirect causes. Furthermore, real-world longitudinal data often suffer from widespread missingness. GC methods are not well-suited to handle these issues. In this paper, we propose an approach named GLACIAL (Granger and LeArning-based CausalIty Analysis for Longitudinal studies) to fill this methodological gap by marrying GC with a multi-task neural forecasting model. GLACIAL treats subjects as independent samples and uses the model's average prediction accuracy on hold-out subjects to probe causal links. Input dropout and model interpolation are used to efficiently learn nonlinear dynamic relationships between a large number of variables and to handle missing values respectively. Extensive simulations and experiments on a real longitudinal medical imaging dataset show GLACIAL beating competitive baselines and confirm its utility. Our code is available at https://github.com/mnhng/GLACIAL.</description>

      <title>Contextual Decision-Making with Knapsacks Beyond the Worst Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the framework of a dynamic decision-making scenario with resource constraints. In this framework, an agent, whose target is to maximize the total reward under the initial inventory, selects an action in each round upon observing a random request, leading to a reward and resource consumptions that are further associated with an unknown random external factor. While previous research has already established an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ worst-case regret for this problem, this work offers two results that go beyond the worst-case perspective: one for the worst-case gap between benchmarks and another for logarithmic regret rates. We first show that an $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ distance between the commonly used fluid benchmark and the online optimum is unavoidable when the former has a degenerate optimal solution. On the algorithmic side, we merge the re-solving heuristic with distribution estimation skills and propose an algorithm that achieves an $\widetilde{O}(1)$ regret as long as the fluid LP has a unique and non-degenerate solution. Furthermore, we prove that our algorithm maintains a near-optimal $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret even in the worst cases and extend these results to the setting where the request and external factor are continuous. Regarding information structure, our regret results are obtained under two feedback models, respectively, where the algorithm accesses the external factor at the end of each round and at the end of a round only when a non-null action is executed.</description>

      <title>Neural Temporal Point Processes for Forecasting Directional Relations in Evolving Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecasting relations between entities is paramount in the current era of data and AI. However, it is often overlooked that real-world relationships are inherently directional, involve more than two entities, and can change with time. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive solution to the problem of forecasting directional relations in a general setting, where relations are higher-order, i.e., directed hyperedges in a hypergraph. This problem has not been previously explored in the existing literature. The primary challenge in solving this problem is that the number of possible hyperedges is exponential in the number of nodes at each event time. To overcome this, we propose a sequential generative approach that segments the forecasting process into multiple stages, each contingent upon the preceding stages, thereby reducing the search space involved in predictions of hyperedges. The first stage involves a temporal point process-based node event forecasting module that identifies the subset of nodes involved in an event. The second stage is a candidate generation module that predicts hyperedge sizes and adjacency vectors for nodes observing events. The final stage is a directed hyperedge predictor that identifies the truth by searching over the set of candidate hyperedges. To validate the effectiveness of our model, we compiled five datasets and conducted an extensive empirical study to assess each downstream task. Our proposed method achieves a performance gain of 32\% and 41\% compared to the state-of-the-art pairwise and hyperedge event forecasting models, respectively, for the event type prediction.</description>

      <title>AwesomeMeta+: Bridging the Technical Barriers to Meta-Learning via A Prototyping and Learning System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meta-learning, also known as "learning to learn", enables models to acquire great generalization abilities by learning from various tasks. Recent advancements have made these models applicable across various fields without data constraints, offering new opportunities for general artificial intelligence. However, applying these models can be challenging due to their often task-specific, standalone nature and the technical barriers involved. To address this challenge, we develop AwesomeMeta+, a prototyping and learning system that standardizes different components of meta-learning and uses a building block metaphor to assist in model construction. AwesomeMeta+ allows users to assemble compatible algorithm modules to meet the application needs in practice. To optimize AwesomeMeta+, we provide the interface to 50 researchers and refine the design based on their feedback. Through machine-based testing and user studies, we demonstrate that AwesomeMeta+ enhances users' understanding of the related technologies and accelerates their engineering processes by offering guidance for meta-learning deployments.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Computation Modules: Granular Conditional Computation For Efficient Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While transformer models have been highly successful, they are computationally inefficient. We observe that for each layer, the full width of the layer may be needed only for a small subset of tokens inside a batch and that the "effective" width needed to process a token can vary from layer to layer. Motivated by this observation, we introduce the Adaptive Computation Module (ACM), a generic module that dynamically adapts its computational load to match the estimated difficulty of the input on a per-token basis. An ACM consists of a sequence of learners that progressively refine the output of their preceding counterparts. An additional gating mechanism determines the optimal number of learners to execute for each token. We also propose a distillation technique to replace any pre-trained model with an "ACMized" variant. Our evaluation of transformer models in computer vision and speech recognition demonstrates that substituting layers with ACMs significantly reduces inference costs without degrading the downstream accuracy for a wide interval of user-defined budgets.</description>

      <title>The Distributional Reward Critic Framework for Reinforcement Learning Under Perturbed Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reward signal plays a central role in defining the desired behaviors of agents in reinforcement learning (RL). Rewards collected from realistic environments could be perturbed, corrupted, or noisy due to an adversary, sensor error, or because they come from subjective human feedback. Thus, it is important to construct agents that can learn under such rewards. Existing methodologies for this problem make strong assumptions, including that the perturbation is known in advance, clean rewards are accessible, or that the perturbation preserves the optimal policy. We study a new, more general, class of unknown perturbations, and introduce a distributional reward critic framework for estimating reward distributions and perturbations during training. Our proposed methods are compatible with any RL algorithm. Despite their increased generality, we show that they achieve comparable or better rewards than existing methods in a variety of environments, including those with clean rewards. Under the challenging and generalized perturbations we study, we win/tie the highest return in 44/48 tested settings (compared to 11/48 for the best baseline). Our results broaden and deepen our ability to perform RL in reward-perturbed environments.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Truck Vehicle Routing Problems with Multi-Leg Demand Routes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to be effective in producing approximate solutions to some vehicle routing problems (VRPs), especially when using policies generated by encoder-decoder attention mechanisms. While these techniques have been quite successful for relatively simple problem instances, there are still under-researched and highly complex VRP variants for which no effective RL method has been demonstrated. In this work we focus on one such VRP variant, which contains multiple trucks and multi-leg routing requirements. In these problems, demand is required to move along sequences of nodes, instead of just from a start node to an end node. With the goal of making deep RL a viable strategy for real-world industrial-scale supply chain logistics, we develop new extensions to existing encoder-decoder attention models which allow them to handle multiple trucks and multi-leg routing requirements. Our models have the advantage that they can be trained for a small number of trucks and nodes, and then embedded into a large supply chain to yield solutions for larger numbers of trucks and nodes. We test our approach on a real supply chain environment arising in the operations of Japanese automotive parts manufacturer Aisin Corporation, and find that our algorithm outperforms Aisin's previous best solution.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Robustness of Link Sign Prediction in Signed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Signed graphs serve as fundamental data structures for representing positive and negative relationships in social networks, with signed graph neural networks (SGNNs) emerging as the primary tool for their analysis. Our investigation reveals that balance theory, while essential for modeling signed relationships in SGNNs, inadvertently introduces exploitable vulnerabilities to black-box attacks. To demonstrate this vulnerability, we propose balance-attack, a novel adversarial strategy specifically designed to compromise graph balance degree, and develop an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve the associated NP-hard optimization problem. While existing approaches attempt to restore attacked graphs through balance learning techniques, they face a critical challenge we term "Irreversibility of Balance-related Information," where restored edges fail to align with original attack targets. To address this limitation, we introduce Balance Augmented-Signed Graph Contrastive Learning (BA-SGCL), an innovative framework that combines contrastive learning with balance augmentation techniques to achieve robust graph representations. By maintaining high balance degree in the latent space, BA-SGCL effectively circumvents the irreversibility challenge and enhances model resilience. Extensive experiments across multiple SGNN architectures and real-world datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness of our proposed balance-attack and the superior robustness of BA-SGCL, advancing the security and reliability of signed graph analysis in social networks. Datasets and codes of the proposed framework are at the github repository https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BA-SGCL-submit-DF41/.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning and Mixture of Experts Enables Precise Vector Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advancement of transformer neural networks has significantly elevated the capabilities of sentence similarity models, but they still struggle with highly discriminative tasks and may produce sub-optimal representations of important documents like scientific literature. With the increased reliance on retrieval augmentation and search, representing diverse documents as concise and descriptive vectors is crucial. This paper improves upon the vectors embeddings of scientific text by assembling niche datasets using co-citations as a similarity metric, focusing on biomedical domains. We apply a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) extension pipeline to pretrained BERT models, where every multi-layer perceptron section is enlarged and copied into multiple distinct experts. Our MoE variants perform well over $N$ scientific domains with $N$ dedicated experts, whereas standard BERT models excel in only one domain at a time. Notably, extending just a single transformer block to MoE captures 85% of the benefit seen from full MoE extension at every layer. This holds promise for versatile and efficient One-Size-Fits-All transformer networks for numerically representing diverse inputs. Our methodology marks advancements in representation learning and holds promise for enhancing vector database search and compilation.</description>

      <title>The VOROS: Lifting ROC curves to 3D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the area under the ROC curve is perhaps the most common measure that is used to rank the relative performance of different binary classifiers, longstanding field folklore has noted that it can be a measure that ill-captures the benefits of different classifiers when either the actual class values or misclassification costs are highly unbalanced between the two classes. We introduce a new ROC surface, and the VOROS, a volume over this ROC surface, as a natural way to capture these costs, by lifting the ROC curve to 3D. Compared to previous attempts to generalize the ROC curve, our formulation also provides a simple and intuitive way to model the scenario when only ranges, rather than exact values, are known for possible class imbalance and misclassification costs.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Multi-domain Generalization with A General Learning Objective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-domain generalization (mDG) is universally aimed to minimize the discrepancy between training and testing distributions to enhance marginal-to-label distribution mapping. However, existing mDG literature lacks a general learning objective paradigm and often imposes constraints on static target marginal distributions. In this paper, we propose to leverage a $Y$-mapping to relax the constraint. We rethink the learning objective for mDG and design a new \textbf{general learning objective} to interpret and analyze most existing mDG wisdom. This general objective is bifurcated into two synergistic amis: learning domain-independent conditional features and maximizing a posterior. Explorations also extend to two effective regularization terms that incorporate prior information and suppress invalid causality, alleviating the issues that come with relaxed constraints. We theoretically contribute an upper bound for the domain alignment of domain-independent conditional features, disclosing that many previous mDG endeavors actually \textbf{optimize partially the objective} and thus lead to limited performance. As such, our study distills a general learning objective into four practical components, providing a general, robust, and flexible mechanism to handle complex domain shifts. Extensive empirical results indicate that the proposed objective with $Y$-mapping leads to substantially better mDG performance in various downstream tasks, including regression, segmentation, and classification.</description>

      <title>Correlated Proxies: A New Definition and Improved Mitigation for Reward Hacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Because it is difficult to precisely specify complex objectives, reinforcement learning policies are often optimized using proxy reward functions that only approximate the true goal. However, optimizing proxy rewards frequently leads to reward hacking: the optimized reward function ceases to be a good proxy and the resulting policy performs poorly with respect to the unspecified true reward. Principled solutions to reward hacking have been impeded by the lack of a good definition for the problem. To address this gap, we introduce a definition of reward hacking based on the correlation between proxy and true rewards for states and actions seen by a "base policy" that breaks down under optimization. We show that this definition captures reward hacking behavior across several realistic settings, including in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Using our formulation, we show theoretically that regularization to the base policy can effectively prevent reward hacking. While the current practice in RLHF applies a KL penalty between action distributions for this purpose, our theory suggests regularizing the $\chi^2$ divergence between the policies' occupancy measures can be more effective. We intuitively show the benefits of this type of regularization and demonstrate that it better mitigates reward hacking in practice across four realistic settings, including RLHF.

      <title>Neuro-Symbolic Embedding for Short and Effective Feature Selection via Autoregressive Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature selection aims to identify the optimal feature subset for enhancing downstream models. Effective feature selection can remove redundant features, save computational resources, accelerate the model learning process, and improve the model overall performance. However, existing works are often time-intensive to identify the effective feature subset within high-dimensional feature spaces. Meanwhile, these methods mainly utilize a single downstream task performance as the selection criterion, leading to the selected subsets that are not only redundant but also lack generalizability. To bridge these gaps, we reformulate feature selection through a neuro-symbolic lens and introduce a novel generative framework aimed at identifying short and effective feature subsets. More specifically, we found that feature ID tokens of the selected subset can be formulated as symbols to reflect the intricate correlations among features. Thus, in this framework, we first create a data collector to automatically collect numerous feature selection samples consisting of feature ID tokens, model performance, and the measurement of feature subset redundancy. Building on the collected data, an encoder-decoder-evaluator learning paradigm is developed to preserve the intelligence of feature selection into a continuous embedding space for efficient search. Within the learned embedding space, we leverage a multi-gradient search algorithm to find more robust and generalized embeddings with the objective of improving model performance and reducing feature subset redundancy. These embeddings are then utilized to reconstruct the feature ID tokens for executing the final feature selection. Ultimately, comprehensive experiments and case studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>From Optimization to Generalization: Fair Federated Learning against Quality Shift via Inter-Client Sharpness Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to escalating privacy concerns, federated learning has been recognized as a vital approach for training deep neural networks with decentralized medical data. In practice, it is challenging to ensure consistent imaging quality across various institutions, often attributed to equipment malfunctions affecting a minority of clients. This imbalance in image quality can cause the federated model to develop an inherent bias towards higher-quality images, thus posing a severe fairness issue. In this study, we pioneer the identification and formulation of this new fairness challenge within the context of the imaging quality shift. Traditional methods for promoting fairness in federated learning predominantly focus on balancing empirical risks across diverse client distributions. This strategy primarily facilitates fair optimization across different training data distributions, yet neglects the crucial aspect of generalization. To address this, we introduce a solution termed Federated learning with Inter-client Sharpness Matching (FedISM). FedISM enhances both local training and global aggregation by incorporating sharpness-awareness, aiming to harmonize the sharpness levels across clients for fair generalization. Our empirical evaluations, conducted using the widely-used ICH and ISIC 2019 datasets, establish FedISM's superiority over current state-of-the-art federated learning methods in promoting fairness.

      <title>Deep Representation Learning for Forecasting Recursive and Multi-Relational Events in Temporal Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding relations arising out of interactions among entities can be very difficult, and predicting them is even more challenging. This problem has many applications in various fields, such as financial networks and e-commerce. These relations can involve much more complexities than just involving more than two entities. One such scenario is evolving recursive relations between multiple entities, and so far, this is still an open problem. This work addresses the problem of forecasting higher-order interaction events that can be multi-relational and recursive. We pose the problem in the framework of representation learning of temporal hypergraphs that can capture complex relationships involving multiple entities. The proposed model, \textit{Relational Recursive Hyperedge Temporal Point Process} (RRHyperTPP) uses an encoder that learns a dynamic node representation based on the historical interaction patterns and then a hyperedge link prediction-based decoder to model the occurrence of interaction events. These learned representations are then used for downstream tasks involving forecasting the type and time of interactions. The main challenge in learning from hyperedge events is that the number of possible hyperedges grows exponentially with the number of nodes in the network. This will make the computation of negative log-likelihood of the temporal point process expensive, as the calculation of survival function requires a summation over all possible hyperedges. In our work, we develop a noise contrastive estimation method to learn the parameters of our model, and we have experimentally shown that our models perform better than previous state-of-the-art methods for interaction forecasting.</description>

We implement and compare the results of four variants of NQDEs on a toy spiral classification problem.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Weather Forecast to Fine-grained Temporal Scales via Physics-AI Hybrid Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13796v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) models have made significant advancements in weather forecasting, particularly in medium-range and nowcasting. However, most data-driven weather forecasting models are black-box systems that focus on learning data mapping rather than fine-grained physical evolution in the time dimension. Consequently, the limitations in the temporal scale of datasets prevent these models from forecasting at finer time scales. This paper proposes a physics-AI hybrid model (i.e., WeatherGFT) which Generalizes weather forecasts to Finer-grained Temporal scales beyond training dataset. Specifically, we employ a carefully designed PDE kernel to simulate physical evolution on a small time scale (e.g., 300 seconds) and use a parallel neural networks with a learnable router for bias correction. Furthermore, we introduce a lead time-aware training framework to promote the generalization of the model at different lead times. The weight analysis of physics-AI modules indicates that physics conducts major evolution while AI performs corrections adaptively. Extensive experiments show that WeatherGFT trained on an hourly dataset, achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple lead times and exhibits the capability to generalize 30-minute forecasts.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Geometric Complexity on Neural Collapse in Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many of the recent remarkable advances in computer vision and language models can be attributed to the success of transfer learning via the pre-training of large foundation models. However, a theoretical framework which explains this empirical success is incomplete and remains an active area of research. Flatness of the loss surface and neural collapse have recently emerged as useful pre-training metrics which shed light on the implicit biases underlying pre-training. In this paper, we explore the geometric complexity of a model's learned representations as a fundamental mechanism that relates these two concepts. We show through experiments and theory that mechanisms which affect the geometric complexity of the pre-trained network also influence the neural collapse. Furthermore, we show how this effect of the geometric complexity generalizes to the neural collapse of new classes as well, thus encouraging better performance on downstream tasks, particularly in the few-shot setting.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Large Language Model for Automated Feature Transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature transformation aims to reconstruct the feature space of raw features to enhance the performance of downstream models. However, the exponential growth in the combinations of features and operations poses a challenge, making it difficult for existing methods to efficiently explore a wide space. Additionally, their optimization is solely driven by the accuracy of downstream models in specific domains, neglecting the acquisition of general feature knowledge. To fill this research gap, we propose an evolutionary LLM framework for automated feature transformation. This framework consists of two parts: 1) constructing a multi-population database through an RL data collector while utilizing evolutionary algorithm strategies for database maintenance, and 2) utilizing the ability of Large Language Model (LLM) in sequence understanding, we employ few-shot prompts to guide LLM in generating superior samples based on feature transformation sequence distinction. Leveraging the multi-population database initially provides a wide search scope to discover excellent populations. Through culling and evolution, the high-quality populations are afforded greater opportunities, thereby furthering the pursuit of optimal individuals. Through the integration of LLMs with evolutionary algorithms, we achieve efficient exploration within a vast space, while harnessing feature knowledge to propel optimization, thus realizing a more adaptable search paradigm. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>TimeCMA: Towards LLM-Empowered Multivariate Time Series Forecasting via Cross-Modality Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01638v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) aims to learn temporal dynamics among variables to forecast future time series. Existing statistical and deep learning-based methods suffer from limited learnable parameters and small-scale training data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) combining time series with textual prompts have achieved promising performance in MTSF. However, we discovered that current LLM-based solutions fall short in learning disentangled embeddings. We introduce TimeCMA, an intuitive yet effective framework for MTSF via cross-modality alignment. Specifically, we present a dual-modality encoding with two branches: the time series encoding branch extracts disentangled yet weak time series embeddings, and the LLM-empowered encoding branch wraps the same time series with text as prompts to obtain entangled yet robust prompt embeddings. As a result, such a cross-modality alignment retrieves both disentangled and robust time series embeddings, ``the best of two worlds'', from the prompt embeddings based on time series and prompt modality similarities. As another key design, to reduce the computational costs from time series with their length textual prompts, we design an effective prompt to encourage the most essential temporal information to be encapsulated in the last token: only the last token is passed to downstream prediction. We further store the last token embeddings to accelerate inference speed. Extensive experiments on eight real datasets demonstrate that TimeCMA outperforms state-of-the-arts.</description>

      <title>e-COP : Episodic Constrained Optimization of Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the $\texttt{e-COP}$ algorithm, the first policy optimization algorithm for constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) in episodic (finite horizon) settings. Such formulations are applicable when there are separate sets of optimization criteria and constraints on a system's behavior. We approach this problem by first establishing a policy difference lemma for the episodic setting, which provides the theoretical foundation for the algorithm. Then, we propose to combine a set of established and novel solution ideas to yield the $\texttt{e-COP}$ algorithm that is easy to implement and numerically stable, and provide a theoretical guarantee on optimality under certain scaling assumptions. Through extensive empirical analysis using benchmarks in the Safety Gym suite, we show that our algorithm has similar or better performance than SoTA (non-episodic) algorithms adapted for the episodic setting. The scalability of the algorithm opens the door to its application in safety-constrained Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for Large Language or Diffusion Models.</description>

      <title>Humor in AI: Massive Scale Crowd-Sourced Preferences and Benchmarks for Cartoon Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel multimodal preference dataset for creative tasks, consisting of over 250 million human ratings on more than 2.2 million captions, collected through crowdsourcing rating data for The New Yorker's weekly cartoon caption contest over the past eight years. This unique dataset supports the development and evaluation of multimodal large language models and preference-based fine-tuning algorithms for humorous caption generation. We propose novel benchmarks for judging the quality of model-generated captions, utilizing both GPT4 and human judgments to establish ranking-based evaluation strategies. Our experimental results highlight the limitations of current fine-tuning methods, such as RLHF and DPO, when applied to creative tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models like GPT4 and Claude currently underperform top human contestants in generating humorous captions. As we conclude this extensive data collection effort, we release the entire preference dataset to the research community, fostering further advancements in AI humor generation and evaluation.</description>

      <title>Structured Unrestricted-Rank Matrices for Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent efforts to scale Transformer models have demonstrated rapid progress across a wide range of tasks (Wei et al., 2022). However, fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks is expensive due to their large parameter counts. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches have emerged as a viable alternative by allowing us to fine-tune models by updating only a small number of parameters. In this work, we propose a general framework for parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), based on structured unrestricted-rank matrices (SURM) which can serve as a drop-in replacement for popular approaches such as Adapters and LoRA. Unlike other methods like LoRA, SURMs provides more flexibility in finding the right balance between compactness and expressiveness. This is achieved by using low displacement rank matrices (LDRMs), which hasn't been used in this context before. SURMs remain competitive with baselines, often providing significant quality improvements while using a smaller parameter budget. SURMs achieve 5-7% accuracy gains on various image classification tasks while replacing low-rank matrices in LoRA. It also results in up to 12x reduction of the number of parameters in adapters (with virtually no loss in quality) on the GLUE benchmark.</description>

      <title>Improving Diffusion Inverse Problem Solving with Decoupled Noise Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved success in solving Bayesian inverse problems with learned data priors. Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems.</description>

      <title>A Data-Centric Perspective on Evaluating Machine Learning Models for Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tabular data is prevalent in real-world machine learning applications, and new models for supervised learning of tabular data are frequently proposed. Comparative studies assessing the performance of models typically consist of model-centric evaluation setups with overly standardized data preprocessing. This paper demonstrates that such model-centric evaluations are biased, as real-world modeling pipelines often require dataset-specific preprocessing and feature engineering. Therefore, we propose a data-centric evaluation framework. We select 10 relevant datasets from Kaggle competitions and implement expert-level preprocessing pipelines for each dataset. We conduct experiments with different preprocessing pipelines and hyperparameter optimization (HPO) regimes to quantify the impact of model selection, HPO, feature engineering, and test-time adaptation. Our main findings are: 1. After dataset-specific feature engineering, model rankings change considerably, performance differences decrease, and the importance of model selection reduces. 2. Recent models, despite their measurable progress, still significantly benefit from manual feature engineering. This holds true for both tree-based models and neural networks. 3. While tabular data is typically considered static, samples are often collected over time, and adapting to distribution shifts can be important even in supposedly static data. These insights suggest that research efforts should be directed toward a data-centric perspective, acknowledging that tabular data requires feature engineering and often exhibits temporal characteristics. Our framework is available under: https://github.com/atschalz/dc_tabeval.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Guardrails have emerged as an alternative to safety alignment for content moderation of large language models (LLMs). Existing model-based guardrails have not been designed for resource-constrained computational portable devices, such as mobile phones, more and more of which are running LLM-based applications locally. We introduce LoRA-Guard, a parameter-efficient guardrail adaptation method that relies on knowledge sharing between LLMs and guardrail models. LoRA-Guard extracts language features from the LLMs and adapts them for the content moderation task using low-rank adapters, while a dual-path design prevents any performance degradation on the generative task. We show that LoRA-Guard outperforms existing approaches with 100-1000x lower parameter overhead while maintaining accuracy, enabling on-device content moderation.</description>

Abstract: Climate change not only threatens agricultural producers but also strains related public agencies and financial institutions. These important food system actors include government entities tasked with insuring grower livelihoods and supporting response to continued global warming. We examine future risk within the U.S. Corn Belt geographic region for one such crucial institution: the U.S. Federal Crop Insurance Program. Specifically, we predict the impacts of climate-driven crop loss at a policy-salient "risk unit" scale. Built through our presented neural network Monte Carlo method, simulations anticipate both more frequent and more severe losses that would result in a costly doubling of the annual probability of maize Yield Protection insurance claims at mid-century. We also provide an open source pipeline and interactive visualization tools to explore these results with configurable statistical treatments. Altogether, we fill an important gap in current understanding for climate adaptation by bridging existing historic yield estimation and climate projection to predict crop loss metrics at policy-relevant granularity.</description>

      <title>Clustering by Mining Density Distributions and Splitting Manifold Structure</title>

Abstract: Spectral clustering requires the time-consuming decomposition of the Laplacian matrix of the similarity graph, thus limiting its applicability to large datasets. To improve the efficiency of spectral clustering, a top-down approach was recently proposed, which first divides the data into several micro-clusters (granular-balls), then splits these micro-clusters when they are not ``compact'', and finally uses these micro-clusters as nodes to construct a similarity graph for more efficient spectral clustering. However, this top-down approach is challenging to adapt to unevenly distributed or structurally complex data. This is because constructing micro-clusters as a rough ball struggles to capture the shape and structure of data in a local range, and the simplistic splitting rule that solely targets ``compactness'' is susceptible to noise and variations in data density and leads to micro-clusters with varying shapes, making it challenging to accurately measure the similarity between them. To resolve these issues and improve spectral clustering, this paper first proposes to start from local structures to obtain micro-clusters, such that the complex structural information inside local neighborhoods is well captured by them. Moreover, by noting that Euclidean distance is more suitable for convex sets, this paper further proposes a data splitting rule that couples local density and data manifold structures, so that the similarities of the obtained micro-clusters can be easily characterized. A novel similarity measure between micro-clusters is then proposed for the final spectral clustering. A series of experiments based on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has better adaptability to structurally complex data than granular-ball based methods.</description>

      <title>Design Principle Transfer in Neural Architecture Search via Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transferable neural architecture search (TNAS) has been introduced to design efficient neural architectures for multiple tasks, to enhance the practical applicability of NAS in real-world scenarios. In TNAS, architectural knowledge accumulated in previous search processes is reused to warm up the architecture search for new tasks. However, existing TNAS methods still search in an extensive search space, necessitating the evaluation of numerous architectures. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a novel transfer paradigm, i.e., design principle transfer. In this work, the linguistic description of various structural components' effects on architectural performance is termed design principles. They are learned from established architectures and then can be reused to reduce the search space by discarding unpromising architectures. Searching in the refined search space can boost both the search performance and efficiency for new NAS tasks. To this end, a large language model (LLM)-assisted design principle transfer (LAPT) framework is devised. In LAPT, LLM is applied to automatically reason the design principles from a set of given architectures, and then a principle adaptation method is applied to refine these principles progressively based on the new search results. Experimental results show that LAPT can beat the state-of-the-art TNAS methods on most tasks and achieve comparable performance on others.</description>

      <title>Optimally Solving Simultaneous-Move Dec-POMDPs: The Sequential Central Planning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The centralized training for decentralized execution paradigm emerged as the state-of-the-art approach to $\epsilon$-optimally solving decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes. However, scalability remains a significant issue. This paper presents a novel and more scalable alternative, namely the sequential-move centralized training for decentralized execution. This paradigm further pushes the applicability of the Bellman's principle of optimality, raising three new properties. First, it allows a central planner to reason upon sufficient sequential-move statistics instead of prior simultaneous-move ones. Next, it proves that $\epsilon$-optimal value functions are piecewise linear and convex in such sufficient sequential-move statistics. Finally, it drops the complexity of the backup operators from double exponential to polynomial at the expense of longer planning horizons. Besides, it makes it easy to use single-agent methods, e.g., SARSA algorithm enhanced with these findings, while still preserving convergence guarantees. Experiments on two- as well as many-agent domains from the literature against $\epsilon$-optimal simultaneous-move solvers confirm the superiority of our novel approach. This paradigm opens the door for efficient planning and reinforcement learning methods for multi-agent systems.</description>

Abstract: The design of aerodynamic shapes, such as airfoils, has traditionally required significant computational resources and relied on predefined design parameters, which limit the potential for novel shape synthesis. In this work, we introduce a data-driven methodology for airfoil generation using a diffusion model. Trained on a dataset of preexisting airfoils, our model can generate an arbitrary number of new airfoils from random vectors, which can be conditioned on specific aerodynamic performance metrics such as lift and drag, or geometric criteria. Our results demonstrate that the diffusion model effectively produces airfoil shapes with realistic aerodynamic properties, offering substantial improvements in efficiency, flexibility, and the potential for discovering innovative airfoil designs. This approach significantly expands the design space, facilitating the synthesis of high-performance aerodynamic shapes that transcend the limitations of traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Risk-averse Total-reward MDPs with ERM and EVaR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing risk-averse objectives in discounted MDPs is challenging because most models do not admit direct dynamic programming equations and require complex history-dependent policies. In this paper, we show that the risk-averse {\em total reward criterion}, under the Entropic Risk Measure (ERM) and Entropic Value at Risk (EVaR) risk measures, can be optimized by a stationary policy, making it simple to analyze, interpret, and deploy. We propose exponential value iteration, policy iteration, and linear programming to compute optimal policies. Compared with prior work, our results only require the relatively mild condition of transient MDPs and allow for {\em both} positive and negative rewards. Our results indicate that the total reward criterion may be preferable to the discounted criterion in a broad range of risk-averse reinforcement learning domains.</description>

      <title>Timer-XL: Long-Context Transformers for Unified Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Timer-XL, a generative Transformer for unified time series forecasting. To uniformly predict 1D and 2D time series, we generalize next token prediction, predominantly adopted for causal generation of 1D sequences, to multivariate next token prediction. The proposed paradigm uniformly formulates various forecasting scenarios as a long-context generation problem. We opt for the generative Transformer, which can capture global-range and causal dependencies while providing contextual flexibility, to implement unified forecasting on univariate series characterized by non-stationarity, multivariate time series with complicated dynamics and correlations, and covariate-informed contexts that include both endogenous and exogenous time series. Technically, we propose a universal TimeAttention to facilitate generative Transformers on multiple time series, which can effectively capture fine-grained intra- and inter-series dependencies of flattened time series tokens (patches), and is further enhanced by deftly designed position embeddings for the temporal and variable dimensions. Timer-XL achieves state-of-the-art performance across challenging forecasting benchmarks through a unified approach. Based on large-scale pre-training, Timer-XL also demonstrates notable zero-shot performance, making it a promising architecture for large time series models.</description>

      <title>KA-GNN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Graph Neural Networks for Molecular Property Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As key models in geometric deep learning, graph neural networks have demonstrated enormous power in molecular data analysis. Recently, a specially-designed learning scheme, known as Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), shows unique potential for the improvement of model accuracy, efficiency, and explainability. Here we propose the first non-trivial Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based Graph Neural Networks (KA-GNNs), including KAN-based graph convolutional networks(KA-GCN) and KAN-based graph attention network (KA-GAT). The essential idea is to utilizes KAN's unique power to optimize GNN architectures at three major levels, including node embedding, message passing, and readout. Further, with the strong approximation capability of Fourier series, we develop Fourier series-based KAN model and provide a rigorous mathematical prove of the robust approximation capability of this Fourier KAN architecture. To validate our KA-GNNs, we consider seven most-widely-used benchmark datasets for molecular property prediction and extensively compare with existing state-of-the-art models. It has been found that our KA-GNNs can outperform traditional GNN models. More importantly, our Fourier KAN module can not only increase the model accuracy but also reduce the computational time. This work not only highlights the great power of KA-GNNs in molecular property prediction but also provides a novel geometric deep learning framework for the general non-Euclidean data analysis.</description>

      <title>Analyzing (In)Abilities of SAEs via Formal Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autoencoders have been used for finding interpretable and disentangled features underlying neural network representations in both image and text domains. While the efficacy and pitfalls of such methods are well-studied in vision, there is a lack of corresponding results, both qualitative and quantitative, for the text domain. We aim to address this gap by training sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on a synthetic testbed of formal languages. Specifically, we train SAEs on the hidden representations of models trained on formal languages (Dyck-2, Expr, and English PCFG) under a wide variety of hyperparameter settings, finding interpretable latents often emerge in the features learned by our SAEs. However, similar to vision, we find performance turns out to be highly sensitive to inductive biases of the training pipeline. Moreover, we show latents correlating to certain features of the input do not always induce a causal impact on model's computation. We thus argue that causality has to become a central target in SAE training: learning of causal features should be incentivized from the ground-up. Motivated by this, we propose and perform preliminary investigations for an approach that promotes learning of causally relevant features in our formal language setting.</description>

      <title>Context Matters: Leveraging Contextual Features for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12672v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series forecasts are often influenced by exogenous contextual features in addition to their corresponding history. For example, in financial settings, it is hard to accurately predict a stock price without considering public sentiments and policy decisions in the form of news articles, tweets, etc. Though this is common knowledge, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasting models fail to incorporate such contextual information, owing to its heterogeneity and multimodal nature. To address this, we introduce ContextFormer, a novel plug-and-play method to surgically integrate multimodal contextual information into existing pre-trained forecasting models. ContextFormer effectively distills forecast-specific information from rich multimodal contexts, including categorical, continuous, time-varying, and even textual information, to significantly enhance the performance of existing base forecasters. ContextFormer outperforms SOTA forecasting models by up to 30% on a range of real-world datasets spanning energy, traffic, environmental, and financial domains.</description>

      <title>Choice Between Partial Trajectories: Disentangling Goals from Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As AI agents generate increasingly sophisticated behaviors, manually encoding human preferences to guide these agents becomes more challenging. To address this, it has been suggested that agents instead learn preferences from human choice data. This approach requires a model of choice behavior that the agent can use to interpret the data. For choices between partial trajectories of states and actions, previous models assume choice probabilities are determined by the partial return or the cumulative advantage.
  We consider an alternative model based instead on the bootstrapped return, which adds to the partial return an estimate of the future return. Benefits of the bootstrapped return model stem from its treatment of human beliefs. Unlike partial return, choices based on bootstrapped return reflect human beliefs about the environment. Further, while recovering the reward function from choices based on cumulative advantage requires that those beliefs are correct, doing so from choices based on bootstrapped return does not.
  To motivate the bootstrapped return model, we formulate axioms and prove an Alignment Theorem. This result formalizes how, for a general class of preferences, such models are able to disentangle goals from beliefs. This ensures recovery of an aligned reward function when learning from choices based on bootstrapped return.
  The bootstrapped return model also affords greater robustness to choice behavior. Even when choices are based on partial return, learning via a bootstrapped return model recovers an aligned reward function. The same holds with choices based on the cumulative advantage if the human and the agent both adhere to correct and consistent beliefs about the environment. On the other hand, if choices are based on bootstrapped return, learning via partial return or cumulative advantage models does not generally produce an aligned reward function..</description>

      <title>Online Intrinsic Rewards for Decision Making Agents from Large Language Model Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatically synthesizing dense rewards from natural language descriptions is a promising paradigm in reinforcement learning (RL), with applications to sparse reward problems, open-ended exploration, and hierarchical skill design. Recent works have made promising steps by exploiting the prior knowledge of large language models (LLMs). However, these approaches suffer from important limitations: they are either not scalable to problems requiring billions of environment samples, due to requiring LLM annotations for each observation, or they require a diverse offline dataset, which may not exist or be impossible to collect. In this work, we address these limitations through a combination of algorithmic and systems-level contributions. We propose \oni, a distributed architecture that simultaneously learns an RL policy and an intrinsic reward function using LLM feedback. Our approach annotates the agent's collected experience via an asynchronous LLM server, which is then distilled into an intrinsic reward model. We explore a range of algorithmic choices for reward modeling with varying complexity, including hashing, classification, and ranking models. By studying their relative tradeoffs, we shed light on questions regarding intrinsic reward design for sparse reward problems. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of challenging, sparse reward tasks from the NetHack Learning Environment in a simple unified process, solely using the agent's gathered experience, without requiring external datasets. We make our code available at \url{https://github.com/facebookresearch/oni}.</description>

      <title>Exploring Gradient Subspaces: Addressing and Overcoming LoRA's Limitations in Federated Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, particularly in task generalization for both text and vision data. While fine-tuning these models can significantly enhance their performance on specific downstream tasks, it often requires high-quality data that cannot be shared due to privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution for collaborative training without direct data sharing. However, many parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for LLMs in FL, particularly those based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), face limitations. In this paper, we critically analyze the convergence and performance guarantees of popular FL frameworks utilizing LoRA, highlighting its suboptimal nature due to constrained subspace learning of low-rank matrices. This limitation hinders effective fine-tuning of LLMs in federated settings. Through rigorous analytical and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that direct weight averaging outperforms LoRA-based strategies, leading to superior performance for fine-tuned models. Our comprehensive comparison unmasks inefficiencies in LoRA approaches and underscores the advantages of direct weight aggregation. We extend our analysis to low-rank gradient-based optimizers, such as GaLore, used during local training steps. Our findings show that GaLore along with direct-weight aggregation is a more effective approach, outperforming federated LoRA methods like FlexLoRA and FFA-LoRA across both text and image modalities. While privacy remains paramount in FL discourse, our focus is on assessing performance outcomes of federated fine-tuned models and evaluating various FL frameworks from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Our findings advocate reassessing the reliance on LoRA within FL contexts, paving the way for more efficient training methodologies.</description>

      <title>Representative Social Choice: From Learning Theory to AI Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social choice theory is the study of preference aggregation across a population, used both in mechanism design for human agents and in the democratic alignment of language models. In this study, we propose the representative social choice framework for the modeling of democratic representation in collective decisions, where the number of issues and individuals are too large for mechanisms to consider all preferences directly. These scenarios are widespread in real-world decision-making processes, such as jury trials, indirect elections, legislation processes, corporate governance, and, more recently, language model alignment. In representative social choice, the population is represented by a finite sample of individual-issue pairs based on which social choice decisions are made. We show that many of the deepest questions in representative social choice can be naturally formulated as statistical learning problems, and prove the generalization properties of social choice mechanisms using the theory of machine learning. We further formulate axioms for representative social choice, and prove Arrow-like impossibility theorems with new combinatorial tools of analysis. Our framework introduces the representative approach to social choice, opening up research directions at the intersection of social choice, learning theory, and AI alignment.</description>

      <title>ManiBox: Enhancing Spatial Grasping Generalization via Scalable Simulation Data Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning a precise robotic grasping policy is crucial for embodied agents operating in complex real-world manipulation tasks. Despite significant advancements, most models still struggle with accurate spatial positioning of objects to be grasped. We first show that this spatial generalization challenge stems primarily from the extensive data requirements for adequate spatial understanding. However, collecting such data with real robots is prohibitively expensive, and relying on simulation data often leads to visual generalization gaps upon deployment. To overcome these challenges, we then focus on state-based policy generalization and present \textbf{ManiBox}, a novel bounding-box-guided manipulation method built on a simulation-based teacher-student framework. The teacher policy efficiently generates scalable simulation data using bounding boxes, which are proven to uniquely determine the objects' spatial positions. The student policy then utilizes these low-dimensional spatial states to enable zero-shot transfer to real robots. Through comprehensive evaluations in simulated and real-world environments, ManiBox demonstrates a marked improvement in spatial grasping generalization and adaptability to diverse objects and backgrounds. Further, our empirical study into scaling laws for policy performance indicates that spatial volume generalization scales with data volume in a power law. For a certain level of spatial volume, the success rate of grasping empirically follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics relative to data volume, showing a saturation effect as data increases. Our videos and code are available in https://thkkk.github.io/manibox.</description>

      <title>The Certainty Ratio $C_\rho$: a novel metric for assessing the reliability of classifier predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating the performance of classifiers is critical in machine learning, particularly in high-stakes applications where the reliability of predictions can significantly impact decision-making. Traditional performance measures, such as accuracy and F-score, often fail to account for the uncertainty inherent in classifier predictions, leading to potentially misleading assessments. This paper introduces the Certainty Ratio ($C_\rho$), a novel metric designed to quantify the contribution of confident (certain) versus uncertain predictions to any classification performance measure. By integrating the Probabilistic Confusion Matrix ($CM^\star$) and decomposing predictions into certainty and uncertainty components, $C_\rho$ provides a more comprehensive evaluation of classifier reliability. Experimental results across 21 datasets and multiple classifiers, including Decision Trees, Naive-Bayes, 3-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forests, demonstrate that $C_\rho$ reveals critical insights that conventional metrics often overlook. These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating probabilistic information into classifier evaluation, offering a robust tool for researchers and practitioners seeking to improve model trustworthiness in complex environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of embodied agents has been shown to improve by increasing model parameters, dataset size, and compute. This has been demonstrated in domains from robotics to video games, when generative learning objectives on offline datasets (pre-training) are used to model an agent's behavior (imitation learning) or their environment (world modeling). This paper characterizes the role of scale in these tasks more precisely. Going beyond the simple intuition that `bigger is better', we show that the same types of power laws found in language modeling also arise in world modeling and imitation learning (e.g. between loss and optimal model size). However, the coefficients of these laws are heavily influenced by the tokenizer, task \&amp; architecture -- this has important implications on the optimal sizing of models and data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) has resulted in vast, heterogeneous graphs that capture complex interactions among devices, sensors, and systems. Efficient analysis of these graphs is critical for deriving insights in IoT scenarios such as smart cities, industrial IoT, and intelligent transportation systems. However, the scale and diversity of IoT-generated data present significant challenges, and existing methods often struggle with preserving the structural integrity and semantic richness of these complex graphs. Many current approaches fail to maintain the balance between computational efficiency and the quality of the insights generated, leading to potential loss of critical information necessary for accurate decision-making in IoT applications. We introduce HeteroSample, a novel sampling method designed to address these challenges by preserving the structural integrity, node and edge type distributions, and semantic patterns of IoT-related graphs. HeteroSample works by incorporating the novel top-leader selection, balanced neighborhood expansion, and meta-path guided sampling strategies. The key idea is to leverage the inherent heterogeneous structure and semantic relationships encoded by meta-paths to guide the sampling process. This approach ensures that the resulting subgraphs are representative of the original data while significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HeteroSample outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 15% higher F1 scores in tasks such as link prediction and node classification, while reducing runtime by 20%.These advantages make HeteroSample a transformative tool for scalable and accurate IoT applications, enabling more effective and efficient analysis of complex IoT systems, ultimately driving advancements in smart cities, industrial IoT, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Using Large Language Models for Expert Prior Elicitation in Predictive Modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), trained on diverse data effectively acquire a breadth of information across various domains. However, their computational complexity, cost, and lack of transparency hinder their direct application for specialised tasks. In fields such as clinical research, acquiring expert annotations or prior knowledge about predictive models is often costly and time-consuming. This study proposes the use of LLMs to elicit expert prior distributions for predictive models. This approach also provides an alternative to in-context learning, where language models are tasked with making predictions directly. In this work, we compare LLM-elicited and uninformative priors, evaluate whether LLMs truthfully generate parameter distributions, and propose a model selection strategy for in-context learning and prior elicitation. Our findings show that LLM-elicited prior parameter distributions significantly reduce predictive error compared to uninformative priors in low-data settings. Applied to clinical problems, this translates to fewer required biological samples, lowering cost and resources. Prior elicitation also consistently outperforms and proves more reliable than in-context learning at a lower cost, making it a preferred alternative in our setting. We demonstrate the utility of this method across various use cases, including clinical applications. For infection prediction, using LLM-elicited priors reduced the number of required labels to achieve the same accuracy as an uninformative prior by 55%, 200 days earlier in the study.</description>

      <title>A Novel Generative Multi-Task Representation Learning Approach for Predicting Postoperative Complications in Cardiac Surgery Patients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early detection of surgical complications allows for timely therapy and proactive risk mitigation. Machine learning (ML) can be leveraged to identify and predict patient risks for postoperative complications. We developed and validated the effectiveness of predicting postoperative complications using a novel surgical Variational Autoencoder (surgVAE) that uncovers intrinsic patterns via cross-task and cross-cohort presentation learning. This retrospective cohort study used data from the electronic health records of adult surgical patients over four years (2018 - 2021). Six key postoperative complications for cardiac surgery were assessed: acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, cardiac arrest, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, blood transfusion, and other intraoperative cardiac events. We compared prediction performances of surgVAE against widely-used ML models and advanced representation learning and generative models under 5-fold cross-validation. 89,246 surgeries (49% male, median (IQR) age: 57 (45-69)) were included, with 6,502 in the targeted cardiac surgery cohort (61% male, median (IQR) age: 60 (53-70)). surgVAE demonstrated superior performance over existing ML solutions across all postoperative complications of cardiac surgery patients, achieving macro-averaged AUPRC of 0.409 and macro-averaged AUROC of 0.831, which were 3.4% and 3.7% higher, respectively, than the best alternative method (by AUPRC scores). Model interpretation using Integrated Gradients highlighted key risk factors based on preoperative variable importance. surgVAE showed excellent discriminatory performance for predicting postoperative complications and addressing the challenges of data complexity, small cohort sizes, and low-frequency positive events. surgVAE enables data-driven predictions of patient risks and prognosis while enhancing the interpretability of patient risk profiles.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Sketches for Frequency Estimation in Data Streams without Ground Truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the frequency of items on the high-volume, fast data stream has been extensively studied in many areas, such as database and network measurement. Traditional sketch algorithms only allow to give very rough estimates with limited memory cost, whereas some learning-augmented algorithms have been proposed recently, their offline framework requires actual frequencies that are challenging to access in general for training, and speed is too slow for real-time processing, despite the still coarse-grained accuracy.
  To this end, we propose a more practical learning-based estimation framework namely UCL-sketch, by following the line of equation-based sketch to estimate per-key frequencies. In a nutshell, there are two key techniques: online training via equivalent learning without ground truth, and highly scalable architecture with logical estimation buckets. We implemented experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets. The results demonstrate that our method greatly outperforms existing state-of-the-art sketches regarding per-key accuracy and distribution, while preserving resource efficiency. Our code is attached in the supplementary material, and will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Y-debug-sys/UCL-sketch.</description>

      <title>Foundations of the Theory of Performance-Based Ranking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ranking entities such as algorithms, devices, methods, or models based on their performances, while accounting for application-specific preferences, is a challenge. To address this challenge, we establish the foundations of a universal theory for performance-based ranking. First, we introduce a rigorous framework built on top of both the probability and order theories. Our new framework encompasses the elements necessary to (1) manipulate performances as mathematical objects, (2) express which performances are worse than or equivalent to others, (3) model tasks through a variable called satisfaction, (4) consider properties of the evaluation, (5) define scores, and (6) specify application-specific preferences through a variable called importance. On top of this framework, we propose the first axiomatic definition of performance orderings and performance-based rankings. Then, we introduce a universal parametric family of scores, called ranking scores, that can be used to establish rankings satisfying our axioms, while considering application-specific preferences. Finally, we show, in the case of two-class classification, that the family of ranking scores encompasses well-known performance scores, including the accuracy, the true positive rate (recall, sensitivity), the true negative rate (specificity), the positive predictive value (precision), and F1. However, we also show that some other scores commonly used to compare classifiers are unsuitable to derive performance orderings satisfying the axioms. Therefore, this paper provides the computer vision and machine learning communities with a rigorous framework for evaluating and ranking entities.</description>

      <title>Transformers Can Navigate Mazes With Multi-Step Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their remarkable success in language modeling, transformers trained to predict the next token in a sequence struggle with long-term planning. This limitation is particularly evident in tasks requiring foresight to plan multiple steps ahead such as maze navigation. The standard next single token prediction objective, however, offers no explicit mechanism to predict multiple steps ahead - or revisit the path taken so far. Consequently, in this work we study whether explicitly predicting multiple steps ahead (and backwards) can improve transformers' maze navigation. We train parameter-matched transformers from scratch, under identical settings, to navigate mazes of varying types and sizes with standard next token prediction and MLM-U, an objective explicitly predicting multiple steps ahead and backwards. We find that MLM-U considerably improves transformers' ability to navigate mazes compared to standard next token prediction across maze types and complexities. We also find MLM-U training is 4x more sample efficient and converges 2x faster in terms of GPU training hours relative to next token training. Finally, for more complex mazes we find MLM-U benefits from scaling to larger transformers. Remarkably, we find transformers trained with MLM-U outperform larger transformers trained with next token prediction using additional supervision from A* search traces. We hope these findings underscore the promise of learning objectives to advance transformers' capacity for long-term planning.

      <title>Optimized Gradient Clipping for Noisy Label Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous research has shown that constraining the gradient of loss function with respect to model-predicted probabilities can enhance the model robustness against noisy labels. These methods typically specify a fixed optimal threshold for gradient clipping through validation data to obtain the desired robustness against noise. However, this common practice overlooks the dynamic distribution of gradients from both clean and noisy-labeled samples at different stages of training, significantly limiting the model capability to adapt to the variable nature of gradients throughout the training process. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach called Optimized Gradient Clipping (OGC), which dynamically adjusts the clipping threshold based on the ratio of noise gradients to clean gradients after clipping, estimated by modeling the distributions of clean and noisy samples. This approach allows us to modify the clipping threshold at each training step, effectively controlling the influence of noise gradients. Additionally, we provide statistical analysis to certify the noise-tolerance ability of OGC. Our extensive experiments across various types of label noise, including symmetric, asymmetric, instance-dependent, and real-world noise, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Go With the Flow: Fast Diffusion for Gaussian Mixture Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger Bridges (SB) are diffusion processes that steer, in finite time, a given initial distribution to another final one while minimizing a suitable cost functional. Although various methods for computing SBs have recently been proposed in the literature, most of these approaches require computationally expensive training schemes, even for solving low-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose an analytic parametrization of a set of feasible policies for steering the distribution of a dynamical system from one Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to another. Instead of relying on standard non-convex optimization techniques, the optimal policy within the set can be approximated as the solution of a low-dimensional linear program whose dimension scales linearly with the number of components in each mixture. Furthermore, our method generalizes naturally to more general classes of dynamical systems such as controllable Linear Time-Varying systems that cannot currently be solved using traditional neural SB approaches. We showcase the potential of this approach in low-to-moderate dimensional problems such as image-to-image translation in the latent space of an autoencoder, and various other examples. We also benchmark our approach on an Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cases where the boundary distributions are mixture models while requiring virtually no training.</description>

      <title>GeLoRA: Geometric Adaptive Ranks For Efficient LoRA Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is computationally intensive because it requires updating all parameters. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) improves efficiency by modifying only a subset of weights but introduces a trade-off between expressivity and computational cost: lower ranks reduce resources but limit expressiveness, while higher ranks enhance expressivity at increased cost. Despite recent advances in adaptive LoRA techniques, existing methods fail to provide a theoretical basis for optimizing the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We propose Geometric Low-Rank Adaptation (GeLoRA), a novel framework that computes the intrinsic dimensionality of hidden state representations to adaptively select LoRA ranks. We demonstrate that the intrinsic dimension provides a lower bound for the optimal rank of LoRA matrices, allowing for a principled selection that balances efficiency and expressivity. GeLoRA dynamically adjusts the rank for each layer based on the intrinsic dimensionality of its input and output representations, recognizing that not all model parameters equally impact fine-tuning. Empirical validation on multiple tasks shows that GeLoRA consistently outperforms recent baselines within the same parameter budget.</description>

      <title>One Node One Model: Featuring the Missing-Half for Graph Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most existing graph clustering methods primarily focus on exploiting topological structure, often neglecting the ``missing-half" node feature information, especially how these features can enhance clustering performance. This issue is further compounded by the challenges associated with high-dimensional features. Feature selection in graph clustering is particularly difficult because it requires simultaneously discovering clusters and identifying the relevant features for these clusters. To address this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm called ``one node one model", which builds an exclusive model for each node and defines the node label as a combination of predictions for node groups. Specifically, the proposed ``Feature Personalized Graph Clustering (FPGC)" method identifies cluster-relevant features for each node using a squeeze-and-excitation block, integrating these features into each model to form the final representations. Additionally, the concept of feature cross is developed as a data augmentation technique to learn low-order feature interactions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FPGC outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods. Moreover, the plug-and-play nature of our method provides a versatile solution to enhance GNN-based models from a feature perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution spatiotemporal simulations effectively capture the complexities of atmospheric plume dispersion in complex terrain. However, their high computational cost makes them impractical for applications requiring rapid responses or iterative processes, such as optimization, uncertainty quantification, or inverse modeling. To address this challenge, this work introduces the Dual-Stage Temporal Three-dimensional UNet Super-resolution (DST3D-UNet-SR) model, a highly efficient deep learning model for plume dispersion prediction. DST3D-UNet-SR is composed of two sequential modules: the temporal module (TM), which predicts the transient evolution of a plume in complex terrain from low-resolution temporal data, and the spatial refinement module (SRM), which subsequently enhances the spatial resolution of the TM predictions. We train DST3DUNet- SR using a comprehensive dataset derived from high-resolution large eddy simulations (LES) of plume transport. We propose the DST3D-UNet-SR model to significantly accelerate LES simulations of three-dimensional plume dispersion by three orders of magnitude. Additionally, the model demonstrates the ability to dynamically adapt to evolving conditions through the incorporation of new observational data, substantially improving prediction accuracy in high-concentration regions near the source.

      <description>arXiv:2412.11003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms in high-dimensional settings are highly susceptible to the influence of even a small fraction of structured outliers, making robust optimization techniques essential. In particular, within the $\epsilon$-contamination model, where an adversary can inspect and replace up to an $\epsilon$-fraction of the samples, a fundamental open problem is determining the optimal rates for robust stochastic convex optimization (SCO) under such contamination. We develop novel algorithms that achieve minimax-optimal excess risk (up to logarithmic factors) under the $\epsilon$-contamination model. Our approach improves over existing algorithms, which are not only suboptimal but also require stringent assumptions, including Lipschitz continuity and smoothness of individual sample functions. By contrast, our optimal algorithms do not require these restrictive assumptions, and can handle nonsmooth but Lipschitz population loss functions. We complement our algorithmic developments with a tight lower bound for robust SCO.</description>

      <title>CiTrus: Squeezing Extra Performance out of Low-data Bio-signal Transfer Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transfer learning for bio-signals has recently become an important technique to improve prediction performance on downstream tasks with small bio-signal datasets. Recent works have shown that pre-training a neural network model on a large dataset (e.g. EEG) with a self-supervised task, replacing the self-supervised head with a linear classification head, and fine-tuning the model on different downstream bio-signal datasets (e.g., EMG or ECG) can dramatically improve the performance on those datasets. In this paper, we propose a new convolution-transformer hybrid model architecture with masked auto-encoding for low-data bio-signal transfer learning, introduce a frequency-based masked auto-encoding task, employ a more comprehensive evaluation framework, and evaluate how much and when (multimodal) pre-training improves fine-tuning performance. We also introduce a dramatically more performant method of aligning a downstream dataset with a different temporal length and sampling rate to the original pre-training dataset. Our findings indicate that the convolution-only part of our hybrid model can achieve state-of-the-art performance on some low-data downstream tasks. The performance is often improved even further with our full model. In the case of transformer-based models we find that pre-training especially improves performance on downstream datasets, multimodal pre-training often increases those gains further, and our frequency-based pre-training performs the best on average for the lowest and highest data regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to make the foundation model more efficient and effective, our idea is combining sequence transformation and state transformation. First, we prove the availability of rotary position embedding in the state space duality algorithm, which reduces the perplexity of the hybrid quadratic causal self-attention and state space duality by more than 4%, to ensure that the combining sequence transformation unifies position encoding. Second, we propose dynamic mask attention, which maintains 100% accuracy in the more challenging multi-query associative recall task, improving by more than 150% compared to quadratic causal self-attention and state space duality, to ensure that the combining sequence transformation selectively filters relevant information. Third, we design cross domain mixture of experts, which makes the computational speed of expert retrieval with more than 1024 experts 8 to 10 times faster than the mixture of experts, to ensure that the combining state transformation quickly retrieval mixture. Finally, we summarize these matrix algorithms that can form the foundation model: Wonderful Matrices, which can be a competitor to popular model architectures.</description>

      <title>AutoSGNN: Automatic Propagation Mechanism Discovery for Spectral Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In real-world applications, spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for processing diverse types of graphs. However, a single GNN often struggles to handle different graph types-such as homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs-simultaneously. This challenge has led to the manual design of GNNs tailored to specific graph types, but these approaches are limited by the high cost of labor and the constraints of expert knowledge, which cannot keep up with the rapid growth of graph data. To overcome these challenges, we propose AutoSGNN, an automated framework for discovering propagation mechanisms in spectral GNNs. AutoSGNN unifies the search space for spectral GNNs by integrating large language models with evolutionary strategies to automatically generate architectures that adapt to various graph types. Extensive experiments on nine widely-used datasets, encompassing both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, demonstrate that AutoSGNN outperforms state-of-the-art spectral GNNs and graph neural architecture search methods in both performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Hybrid Inference with On-Device Small and Remote Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a hybrid language model (HLM) architecture that integrates a small language model (SLM) operating on a mobile device with a large language model (LLM) hosted at the base station (BS) of a wireless network. The HLM token generation process follows the speculative inference principle: the SLM's vocabulary distribution is uploaded to the LLM, which either accepts or rejects it, with rejected tokens being resampled by the LLM. While this approach ensures alignment between the vocabulary distributions of the SLM and LLM, it suffers from low token throughput due to uplink transmission and the computation costs of running both language models. To address this, we propose a novel HLM structure coined Uncertainty-aware opportunistic HLM (U-HLM), wherein the SLM locally measures its output uncertainty and skips both uplink transmissions and LLM operations for tokens that are likely to be accepted. This opportunistic skipping is enabled by our empirical finding of a linear correlation between the SLM's uncertainty and the LLM's rejection probability. We analytically derive the uncertainty threshold and evaluate its expected risk of rejection. Simulations show that U-HLM reduces uplink transmissions and LLM computations by 45.93%, while achieving up to 97.54% of the LLM's inference accuracy and 2.54$\times$ faster token throughput than HLM without skipping.</description>

      <title>Versatile Ordering Network: An Attention-based Neural Network for Ordering Across Scales and Quality Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ordering has been extensively studied in many visualization applications, such as axis and matrix reordering, for the simple reason that the order will greatly impact the perceived pattern of data. Many quality metrics concerning data pattern, perception, and aesthetics are proposed, and respective optimization algorithms are developed. However, the optimization problems related to ordering are often difficult to solve (e.g., TSP is NP-complete), and developing specialized optimization algorithms is costly. In this paper, we propose Versatile Ordering Network (VON), which automatically learns the strategy to order given a quality metric. VON uses the quality metric to evaluate its solutions, and leverages reinforcement learning with a greedy rollout baseline to improve itself. This keeps the metric transparent and allows VON to optimize over different metrics. Additionally, VON uses the attention mechanism to collect information across scales and reposition the data points with respect to the current context. This allows VONs to deal with data points following different distributions. We examine the effectiveness of VON under different usage scenarios and metrics. The results demonstrate that VON can produce comparable results to specialized solvers. The code is available at https://github.com/sysuvis/VON.</description>

      <title>Graph Spring Neural ODEs for Link Sign Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Signed graphs allow for encoding positive and negative relations between nodes and are used to model various online activities. Node representation learning for signed graphs is a well-studied task with important applications such as sign prediction. While the size of datasets is ever-increasing, recent methods often sacrifice scalability for accuracy. We propose a novel message-passing layer architecture called Graph Spring Network (GSN) modeled after spring forces. We combine it with a Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) formalism to optimize the system dynamics in embedding space to solve a downstream prediction task. Once the dynamics is learned, embedding generation for novel datasets is done by solving the ODEs in time using a numerical integration scheme. Our GSN layer leverages the fast-to-compute edge vector directions and learnable scalar functions that only depend on nodes' distances in latent space to compute the nodes' positions. Conversely, Graph Convolution and Graph Attention Network layers rely on learnable vector functions that require the full positions of input nodes in latent space. We propose a specific implementation called Spring-Neural-Network (SPR-NN) using a set of small neural networks mimicking attracting and repulsing spring forces that we train for link sign prediction. Experiments show that our method achieves accuracy close to the state-of-the-art methods with node generation time speedup factors of up to 28,000 on large graphs.</description>

      <title>Understanding Key Point Cloud Features for Development Three-dimensional Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14164v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose serious challenges for deep neural network (DNN)-based analysis of various input signals. In the case of three-dimensional point clouds, methods have been developed to identify points that play a key role in network decision, and these become crucial in generating existing adversarial attacks. For example, a saliency map approach is a popular method for identifying adversarial drop points, whose removal would significantly impact the network decision. This paper seeks to enhance the understanding of three-dimensional adversarial attacks by exploring which point cloud features are most important for predicting adversarial points. Specifically, Fourteen key point cloud features such as edge intensity and distance from the centroid are defined, and multiple linear regression is employed to assess their predictive power for adversarial points. Based on critical feature selection insights, a new attack method has been developed to evaluate whether the selected features can generate an attack successfully. Unlike traditional attack methods that rely on model-specific vulnerabilities, this approach focuses on the intrinsic characteristics of the point clouds themselves. It is demonstrated that these features can predict adversarial points across four different DNN architectures, Point Network (PointNet), PointNet++, Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (DGCNN), and Point Convolutional Network (PointConv) outperforming random guessing and achieving results comparable to saliency map-based attacks. This study has important engineering applications, such as enhancing the security and robustness of three-dimensional point cloud-based systems in fields like robotics and autonomous driving.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00200v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion map particle system (DMPS) for generative modeling, based on diffusion maps and Laplacian-adjusted Wasserstein gradient descent (LAWGD). Diffusion maps are used to approximate the generator of the corresponding Langevin diffusion process from samples, and hence to learn the underlying data-generating manifold. On the other hand, LAWGD enables efficient sampling from the target distribution given a suitable choice of kernel, which we construct here via a spectral approximation of the generator, computed with diffusion maps. Our method requires no offline training and minimal tuning, and can outperform other approaches on data sets of moderate dimension.</description>

      <title>Flexible and efficient emulation of spatial extremes processes via variational autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08079v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world processes have complex tail dependence structures that cannot be characterized using classical Gaussian processes. More flexible spatial extremes models exhibit appealing extremal dependence properties but are often exceedingly prohibitive to fit and simulate from in high dimensions. In this paper, we aim to push the boundaries on computation and modeling of high-dimensional spatial extremes via integrating a new spatial extremes model that has flexible and non-stationary dependence properties in the encoding-decoding structure of a variational autoencoder called the XVAE. The XVAE can emulate spatial observations and produce outputs that have the same statistical properties as the inputs, especially in the tail. Our approach also provides a novel way of making fast inference with complex extreme-value processes. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that our XVAE is substantially more time-efficient than traditional Bayesian inference while outperforming many spatial extremes models with a stationary dependence structure. Lastly, we analyze a high-resolution satellite-derived dataset of sea surface temperature in the Red Sea, which includes 30 years of daily measurements at 16703 grid cells. We demonstrate how to use XVAE to identify regions susceptible to marine heatwaves under climate change and examine the spatial and temporal variability of the extremal dependence structure.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Noise: Bringing Clarity to ML Parameterization Design with O(100) Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) parameterizations of subgrid processes (here of turbulence, convection, and radiation) may one day replace conventional parameterizations by emulating high-resolution physics without the cost of explicit simulation. However, uncertainty about the relationship between offline and online performance (i.e., when integrated with a large-scale general circulation model (GCM)) hinders their development. Much of this uncertainty stems from limited sampling of the noisy, emergent effects of upstream ML design decisions on downstream online hybrid simulation. Our work rectifies the sampling issue via the construction of a semi-automated, end-to-end pipeline for $\mathcal{O}(100)$ size ensembles of hybrid simulations, revealing important nuances in how systematic reductions in offline error manifest in changes to online error and online stability. For example, removing dropout and switching from a Mean Squared Error (MSE) to a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss both reduce offline error, but they have opposite effects on online error and online stability. Other design decisions, like incorporating memory, converting moisture input from specific humidity to relative humidity, using batch normalization, and training on multiple climates do not come with any such compromises. Finally, we show that ensemble sizes of $\mathcal{O}(100)$ may be necessary to reliably detect causally relevant differences online. By enabling rapid online experimentation at scale, we can empirically settle debates regarding subgrid ML parameterization design that would have otherwise remained unresolved in the noise.</description>

      <title>An introduction to reinforcement learning for neuroscience</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has a rich history in neuroscience, from early work on dopamine as a reward prediction error signal (Schultz et al., 1997) to recent work proposing that the brain could implement a form of 'distributional reinforcement learning' popularized in machine learning (Dabney et al., 2020). There has been a close link between theoretical advances in reinforcement learning and neuroscience experiments throughout this literature, and the theories describing the experimental data have therefore become increasingly complex. Here, we provide an introduction and mathematical background to many of the methods that have been used in systems neroscience. We start with an overview of the RL problem and classical temporal difference algorithms, followed by a discussion of 'model-free', 'model-based', and intermediate RL algorithms. We then introduce deep reinforcement learning and discuss how this framework has led to new insights in neuroscience. This includes a particular focus on meta-reinforcement learning (Wang et al., 2018) and distributional RL (Dabney et al., 2020). Finally, we discuss potential shortcomings of the RL formalism for neuroscience and highlight open questions in the field. Code that implements the methods discussed and generates the figures is also provided.</description>

      <title>Deep encoder-decoder hierarchical convolutional neural networks for conjugate heat transfer surrogate modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conjugate heat transfer (CHT) analyses are vital for the design of many energy systems. However, high-fidelity CHT numerical simulations are computationally intensive, which limits their applications such as design optimization, where hundreds to thousands of evaluations are required. In this work, we develop a modular deep encoder-decoder hierarchical (DeepEDH) convolutional neural network, a novel deep-learning-based surrogate modeling methodology for computationally intensive CHT analyses. Leveraging convective temperature dependencies, we propose a two-stage temperature prediction architecture that couples velocity and temperature fields. The proposed DeepEDH methodology is demonstrated by modeling the pressure, velocity, and temperature fields for a liquid-cooled cold-plate-based battery thermal management system with variable channel geometry. A computational mesh and CHT formulation of the cold plate is created and solved using the finite element method (FEM), generating a dataset of 1,500 simulations. Our performance analysis covers the impact of the novel architecture, separate DeepEDH models for each field, output geometry masks, multi-stage temperature field predictions, and optimizations of the hyperparameters and architecture. Furthermore, we quantify the influence of the CHT analysis' thermal boundary conditions on surrogate model performance, highlighting improved temperature model performance with higher heat fluxes. Compared to other deep learning neural network surrogate models, such as U-Net and DenseED, the proposed DeepEDH architecture for CHT analyses exhibits up to a 65% enhancement in the coefficient of determination $R^{2}$.

      <title>Metric Entropy-Free Sample Complexity Bounds for Sample Average Approximation in Convex Stochastic Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00664v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies sample average approximation (SAA) in solving convex or strongly convex stochastic programming (SP) problems. Under some common regularity conditions, we show -- perhaps for the first time -- that SAA's sample complexity can be completely free from any quantification of metric entropy (such as the logarithm of the covering number), leading to a significantly more efficient rate with dimensionality $d$ than most existing results. From the newly established complexity bounds, an important revelation is that SAA and the canonical stochastic mirror descent (SMD) method, two mainstream solution approaches to SP, entail almost identical rates of sample efficiency, lifting a theoretical discrepancy of SAA from SMD by the order of $O(d)$. Furthermore, this paper explores non-Lipschitzian scenarios where SAA maintains provable efficacy but the corresponding results for SMD remain mostly unexplored, indicating the potential of SAA's better applicability in some irregular settings.</description>

      <title>Deep hybrid models: infer and plan in a dynamic world</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to determine an optimal plan for a complex task, one often deals with dynamic and hierarchical relationships between several entities. Traditionally, such problems are tackled with optimal control, which relies on the optimization of cost functions; instead, a recent biologically-motivated proposal casts planning and control as an inference process. Active inference assumes that action and perception are two complementary aspects of life whereby the role of the former is to fulfill the predictions inferred by the latter. In this study, we present a solution, based on active inference, for complex control tasks. The proposed architecture exploits hybrid (discrete and continuous) processing, and it is based on three features: the representation of potential body configurations related to the objects of interest; the use of hierarchical relationships that enable the agent to flexibly expand its body schema for tool use; the definition of potential trajectories related to the agent's intentions, used to infer and plan with dynamic elements at different temporal scales. We evaluate this deep hybrid model on a habitual task: reaching a moving object after having picked a moving tool. We show that the model can tackle the presented task under different conditions. This study extends past work on planning as inference and advances an alternative direction to optimal control.</description>

      <title>Towards a Dynamic Future with Adaptable Computing and Network Convergence (ACNC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of advancing 6G, a substantial paradigm shift is anticipated, highlighting comprehensive everything-to-everything interactions characterized by numerous connections and stringent adherence to Quality of Service/Experience (QoS/E) prerequisites. The imminent challenge stems from resource scarcity, prompting a deliberate transition to Computing-Network Convergence (CNC) as an auspicious approach for joint resource orchestration. While CNC-based mechanisms have garnered attention, their effectiveness in realizing future services, particularly in use cases like the Metaverse, may encounter limitations due to the continually changing nature of users, services, and resources. Hence, this paper presents the concept of Adaptable CNC (ACNC) as an autonomous Machine Learning (ML)-aided mechanism crafted for the joint orchestration of computing and network resources, catering to dynamic and voluminous user requests with stringent requirements. ACNC encompasses two primary functionalities: state recognition and context detection. Given the intricate nature of the user-service-computing-network space, the paper employs dimension reduction to generate live, holistic, abstract system states in a hierarchical structure. To address the challenges posed by dynamic changes, Continual Learning (CL) is employed, classifying the system state into contexts controlled by dedicated ML agents, enabling them to operate efficiently. These two functionalities are intricately linked within a closed loop overseen by the End-to-End (E2E) orchestrator to allocate resources. The paper introduces the components of ACNC, proposes a Metaverse scenario to exemplify ACNC's role in resource provisioning with Segment Routing v6 (SRv6), outlines ACNC's workflow, details a numerical analysis for efficiency assessment, and concludes with discussions on relevant challenges and potential avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>To Label or Not to Label: Hybrid Active Learning for Neural Machine Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active learning (AL) techniques reduce labeling costs for training neural machine translation (NMT) models by selecting smaller representative subsets from unlabeled data for annotation. Diversity sampling techniques select heterogeneous instances, while uncertainty sampling methods select instances with the highest model uncertainty. Both approaches have limitations - diversity methods may extract varied but trivial examples, while uncertainty sampling can yield repetitive, uninformative instances. To bridge this gap, we propose Hybrid Uncertainty and Diversity Sampling (HUDS), an AL strategy for domain adaptation in NMT that combines uncertainty and diversity for sentence selection. HUDS computes uncertainty scores for unlabeled sentences and subsequently stratifies them. It then clusters sentence embeddings within each stratum and computes diversity scores by distance to the centroid. A weighted hybrid score that combines uncertainty and diversity is then used to select the top instances for annotation in each AL iteration. Experiments on multi-domain German-English and French-English datasets demonstrate the better performance of HUDS over other strong AL baselines. We analyze the sentence selection with HUDS and show that it prioritizes diverse instances having high model uncertainty for annotation in early AL iterations.</description>

Abstract: The explosion of data available in life sciences is fueling an increasing demand for expressive models and computational methods. Graph transformation is a model for dynamic systems with a large variety of applications. We introduce a novel method of the graph transformation model construction, combining generative and dynamical viewpoints to give a fully automated data-driven model inference method.
  The method takes the input dynamical properties, given as a "snapshot" of the dynamics encoded by explicit transitions, and constructs a compatible model. The obtained model is guaranteed to be minimal, thus framing the approach as model compression (from a set of transitions into a set of rules). The compression is permissive to a lossy case, where the constructed model is allowed to exhibit behavior outside of the input transitions, thus suggesting a completion of the input dynamics.
  The task of graph transformation model inference is naturally highly challenging due to the combinatorics involved. We tackle the exponential explosion by proposing a heuristically minimal translation of the task into a well-established problem, set cover, for which highly optimized solutions exist. We further showcase how our results relate to Kolmogorov complexity expressed in terms of graph transformation.</description>

      <title>Explainable Risk Classification in Financial Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every publicly traded company in the US is required to file an annual 10-K financial report, which contains a wealth of information about the company. In this paper, we propose an explainable deep-learning model, called FinBERT-XRC, that takes a 10-K report as input, and automatically assesses the post-event return volatility risk of its associated company. In contrast to previous systems, our proposed model simultaneously offers explanations of its classification decision at three different levels: the word, sentence, and corpus levels. By doing so, our model provides a comprehensive interpretation of its prediction to end users. This is particularly important in financial domains, where the transparency and accountability of algorithmic predictions play a vital role in their application to decision-making processes. Aside from its novel interpretability, our model surpasses the state of the art in predictive accuracy in experiments on a large real-world dataset of 10-K reports spanning six years.</description>

      <title>Visual Deformation Detection Using Soft Material Simulation for Pre-training of Condition Assessment Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of geometric quality assurance in manufacturing, particularly when human assessment is required. It proposes using Blender, an open-source simulation tool, to create synthetic datasets for machine learning (ML) models. The process involves translating expert information into shape key parameters to simulate deformations, generating images for both deformed and non-deformed objects. The study explores the impact of discrepancies between real and simulated environments on ML model performance and investigates the effect of different simulation backgrounds on model sensitivity. Additionally, the study aims to enhance the model's robustness to camera positioning by generating datasets with a variety of randomized viewpoints. The entire process, from data synthesis to model training and testing, is implemented using a Python API interfacing with Blender. An experiment with a soda can object validates the accuracy of the proposed pipeline.</description>

      <title>On Affine Homotopy between Language Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained language encoders -- functions that represent text as vectors -- are an integral component of many NLP tasks. We tackle a natural question in language encoder analysis: What does it mean for two encoders to be similar? We contend that a faithful measure of similarity needs to be \emph{intrinsic}, that is, task-independent, yet still be informative of \emph{extrinsic} similarity -- the performance on downstream tasks. It is common to consider two encoders similar if they are \emph{homotopic}, i.e., if they can be aligned through some transformation. In this spirit, we study the properties of \emph{affine} alignment of language encoders and its implications on extrinsic similarity. We find that while affine alignment is fundamentally an asymmetric notion of similarity, it is still informative of extrinsic similarity. We confirm this on datasets of natural language representations. Beyond providing useful bounds on extrinsic similarity, affine intrinsic similarity also allows us to begin uncovering the structure of the space of pre-trained encoders by defining an order over them.</description>

      <title>Flash Diffusion: Accelerating Any Conditional Diffusion Model for Few Steps Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient, fast, and versatile distillation method to accelerate the generation of pre-trained diffusion models: Flash Diffusion. The method reaches state-of-the-art performances in terms of FID and CLIP-Score for few steps image generation on the COCO2014 and COCO2017 datasets, while requiring only several GPU hours of training and fewer trainable parameters than existing methods. In addition to its efficiency, the versatility of the method is also exposed across several tasks such as text-to-image, inpainting, face-swapping, super-resolution and using different backbones such as UNet-based denoisers (SD1.5, SDXL) or DiT (Pixart-$\alpha$), as well as adapters. In all cases, the method allowed to reduce drastically the number of sampling steps while maintaining very high-quality image generation. The official implementation is available at https://github.com/gojasper/flash-diffusion.</description>

      <title>LLM Whisperer: An Inconspicuous Attack to Bias LLM Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Writing effective prompts for large language models (LLM) can be unintuitive and burdensome. In response, services that optimize or suggest prompts have emerged. While such services can reduce user effort, they also introduce a risk: the prompt provider can subtly manipulate prompts to produce heavily biased LLM responses. In this work, we show that subtle synonym replacements in prompts can increase the likelihood (by a difference up to 78%) that LLMs mention a target concept (e.g., a brand, political party, nation). We substantiate our observations through a user study, showing our adversarially perturbed prompts 1) are indistinguishable from unaltered prompts by humans, 2) push LLMs to recommend target concepts more often, and 3) make users more likely to notice target concepts, all without arousing suspicion. The practicality of this attack has the potential to undermine user autonomy. Among other measures, we recommend implementing warnings against using prompts from untrusted parties.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Lyrics Detection Across Languages and Genres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the use of large language models (LLMs) to generate music content, particularly lyrics, has gained in popularity. These advances provide valuable tools for artists and enhance their creative processes, but they also raise concerns about copyright violations, consumer satisfaction, and content spamming. Previous research has explored content detection in various domains. However, no work has focused on the modality of lyrics in music. To address this gap, we curated a diverse dataset of real and synthetic lyrics from multiple languages, music genres, and artists. The generation pipeline was validated using both humans and automated methods. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of existing synthetic text detection features on this novel data type. Additionally, we explored strategies to adjust the best feature for lyrics using unsupervised adaptation. Adhering to constraints of our application domain, we investigated cross-lingual generalization, data scalability, robustness to language combinations, and the impact of genre novelty in a few-shot detection scenario. Our findings show promising results within language families and similar genres, yet challenges persist with lyrics in languages that exhibit distinct semantic structures.</description>

      <title>FFHFlow: A Flow-based Variational Approach for Learning Diverse Dexterous Grasps with Shape-Aware Introspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthesizing diverse dexterous grasps from uncertain partial observation is an important yet challenging task for physically intelligent embodiments. Previous works on generative grasp synthesis fell short of precisely capturing the complex grasp distribution and reasoning about shape uncertainty in the unstructured and often partially perceived reality. In this work, we introduce a novel model that can generate diverse grasps for a multi-fingered hand while introspectively handling perceptual uncertainty and recognizing unknown object geometry to avoid performance degradation. Specifically, we devise a Deep Latent Variable Model (DLVM) based on Normalizing Flows (NFs), facilitating hierarchical and expressive latent representation for modeling versatile grasps. Our model design counteracts typical pitfalls of its popular alternative in generative grasping, i.e., conditional Variational Autoencoders (cVAEs) whose performance is limited by mode collapse and miss-specified prior issues. Moreover, the resultant feature hierarchy and the exact flow likelihood computation endow our model with shape-aware introspective capabilities, enabling it to quantify the shape uncertainty of partial point clouds and detect objects of novel geometry. We further achieve performance gain by fusing this information with a discriminative grasp evaluator, facilitating a novel hybrid way for grasp evaluation. Comprehensive simulated and real-world experiments show that the proposed idea gains superior performance and higher run-time efficiency against strong baselines, including diffusion models. We also demonstrate substantial benefits of greater diversity for grasping objects in clutter and a confined workspace in the real world.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the update of weight matrices in learning algorithms can be described in the framework of Dyson Brownian motion, thereby inheriting many features of random matrix theory. We relate the level of stochasticity to the ratio of the learning rate and the mini-batch size, providing more robust evidence to a previously conjectured scaling relationship. We discuss universal and non-universal features in the resulting Coulomb gas distribution and identify the Wigner surmise and Wigner semicircle explicitly in a teacher-student model and in the (near-)solvable case of the Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18416v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persona agents, which are LLM agents that act according to an assigned persona, have demonstrated impressive contextual response capabilities across various applications. These persona agents offer significant enhancements across diverse sectors, such as education, healthcare, and entertainment, where model developers can align agent responses to different user requirements thereby broadening the scope of agent applications. However, evaluating persona agent performance is incredibly challenging due to the complexity of assessing persona adherence in free-form interactions across various environments that are relevant to each persona agent. We introduce PersonaGym, the first dynamic evaluation framework for assessing persona agents, and PersonaScore, the first automated human-aligned metric grounded in decision theory for comprehensive large-scale evaluation of persona agents. Our evaluation of 6 open and closed-source LLMs, using a benchmark encompassing 200 personas and 10,000 questions, reveals significant opportunities for advancement in persona agent capabilities across state-of-the-art models. For example, Claude 3.5 Sonnet only has a 2.97% relative improvement in PersonaScore than GPT 3.5 despite being a much more advanced model. Importantly, we find that increased model size and complexity do not necessarily imply enhanced persona agent capabilities thereby highlighting the pressing need for algorithmic and architectural invention towards faithful and performant persona agents.</description>

      <title>Walk Wisely on Graph: Knowledge Graph Reasoning with Dual Agents via Efficient Guidance-Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01880v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years, multi-hop reasoning has been widely studied for knowledge graph (KG) reasoning due to its efficacy and interpretability. However, previous multi-hop reasoning approaches are subject to two primary shortcomings. First, agents struggle to learn effective and robust policies at the early phase due to sparse rewards. Second, these approaches often falter on specific datasets like sparse knowledge graphs, where agents are required to traverse lengthy reasoning paths. To address these problems, we propose a multi-hop reasoning model with dual agents based on hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), which is named FULORA. FULORA tackles the above reasoning challenges by eFficient GUidance-ExpLORAtion between dual agents. The high-level agent walks on the simplified knowledge graph to provide stage-wise hints for the low-level agent walking on the original knowledge graph. In this framework, the low-level agent optimizes a value function that balances two objectives: (1) maximizing return, and (2) integrating efficient guidance from the high-level agent. Experiments conducted on three real-word knowledge graph datasets demonstrate that FULORA outperforms RL-based baselines, especially in the case of long-distance reasoning.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08074v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The forthcoming generation of wireless technology, 6G, aims to usher in an era of ubiquitous intelligent services, where everything is interconnected and intelligent. This vision requires the seamless integration of three fundamental modules: Sensing for information acquisition, communication for information sharing, and computation for information processing and decision-making. These modules are intricately linked, especially in complex tasks such as edge learning and inference. However, the performance of these modules is interdependent, creating a resource competition for time, energy, and bandwidth. Existing techniques like integrated communication and computation (ICC), integrated sensing and computation (ISC), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) have made partial strides in addressing this challenge, but they fall short of meeting the extreme performance requirements. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop new techniques that comprehensively integrate sensing, communication, and computation. This integrated approach, known as Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation (ISCC), offers a systematic perspective for enhancing task performance. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of historic and related techniques such as ICC, ISC, and ISAC, highlighting their strengths and limitations. It then discusses the benefits, functions, and challenges of ISCC. Subsequently, the state-of-the-art signal designs for ISCC, along with network resource management strategies specifically tailored for ISCC are explored. Furthermore, this paper discusses the exciting research opportunities that lie ahead for implementing ISCC in future advanced networks, and the unresolved issues requiring further investigation. ISCC is expected to unlock the full potential of intelligent connectivity, paving the way for groundbreaking applications and services.</description>

      <title>Urban traffic analysis and forecasting through shared Koopman eigenmodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting traffic flow in data-scarce cities is challenging due to limited historical data. To address this, we leverage transfer learning by identifying periodic patterns common to data-rich cities using a customized variant of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD): constrained Hankelized DMD (TrHDMD). This method uncovers common eigenmodes (urban heartbeats) in traffic patterns and transfers them to data-scarce cities, significantly enhancing prediction performance. TrHDMD reduces the need for extensive training datasets by utilizing prior knowledge from other cities. By applying Koopman operator theory to multi-city loop detector data, we identify stable, interpretable, and time-invariant traffic modes. Injecting ``urban heartbeats'' into forecasting tasks improves prediction accuracy and has the potential to enhance traffic management strategies for cities with varying data infrastructures. Our work introduces cross-city knowledge transfer via shared Koopman eigenmodes, offering actionable insights and reliable forecasts for data-scarce urban environments.</description>

      <title>Cross-Dataset Gaze Estimation by Evidential Inter-intra Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving accurate and reliable gaze predictions in complex and diverse environments remains challenging. Fortunately, it is straightforward to access diverse gaze datasets in real-world applications. We discover that training these datasets jointly can significantly improve the generalization of gaze estimation, which is overlooked in previous works. However, due to the inherent distribution shift across different datasets, simply mixing multiple dataset decreases the performance in the original domain despite gaining better generalization abilities. To address the problem of ``cross-dataset gaze estimation'', we propose a novel Evidential Inter-intra Fusion EIF framework, for training a cross-dataset model that performs well across all source and unseen domains. Specifically, we build independent single-dataset branches for various datasets where the data space is partitioned into overlapping subspaces within each dataset for local regression, and further create a cross-dataset branch to integrate the generalizable features from single-dataset branches. Furthermore, evidential regressors based on the Normal and Inverse-Gamma (NIG) distribution are designed to additionally provide uncertainty estimation apart from predicting gaze. Building upon this foundation, our proposed framework achieves both intra-evidential fusion among multiple local regressors within each dataset and inter-evidential fusion among multiple branches by Mixture \textbfof Normal Inverse-Gamma (MoNIG distribution. Experiments demonstrate that our method consistently achieves notable improvements in both source domains and unseen domains.</description>

Abstract: Spatial multi-modal omics technology, highlighted by Nature Methods as an advanced biological technique in 2023, plays a critical role in resolving biological regulatory processes with spatial context. Recently, graph neural networks based on K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs have gained prominence in spatial multi-modal omics methods due to their ability to model semantic relations between sequencing spots. However, the fixed KNN graph fails to capture the latent semantic relations hidden by the inevitable data perturbations during the biological sequencing process, resulting in the loss of semantic information. In addition, the common lack of spot annotation and class number priors in practice further hinders the optimization of spatial multi-modal omics models. Here, we propose a novel spatial multi-modal omics resolved framework, termed PRototype-Aware Graph Adaptative Aggregation for Spatial Multi-modal Omics Analysis (PRAGA). PRAGA constructs a dynamic graph to capture latent semantic relations and comprehensively integrate spatial information and feature semantics. The learnable graph structure can also denoise perturbations by learning cross-modal knowledge. Moreover, a dynamic prototype contrastive learning is proposed based on the dynamic adaptability of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models to optimize the multi-modal omics representations for unknown biological priors. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on simulated and real datasets with 7 competing methods demonstrate the superior performance of PRAGA.

      <title>TACO-RL: Task Aware Prompt Compression Optimization with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 in various applications has led to a surge in the size of prompts required for optimal performance, leading to challenges in computational efficiency. Prompt compression aims to reduce the inference cost by minimizing input tokens without compromising on the task performance. However, existing prompt compression techniques either rely on sub-optimal metrics such as information entropy or model it as a task-agnostic token classification problem that fails to capture task-specific information. To address these issues, we propose a novel and efficient reinforcement learning (RL) based task-aware prompt compression method. To ensure low latency requirements, we leverage existing Transformer encoder-based token classification model while guiding the learning process with task-specific reward signals using lightweight REINFORCE algorithm. We evaluate the performance of our method on three diverse and challenging tasks including text summarization, question answering and code summarization. We demonstrate that our RL-guided compression method improves the task performance by 8% - 189% across these three scenarios over state-of-the-art compression techniques while satisfying the same compression rate and latency requirements.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Interacting Multiple Model Particle Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for parameter learning when the studied model exhibits random discontinuous jumps in behaviour. To facilitate the learning of high dimensional parameter sets, such as those associated to neural networks, we adopt the emerging framework of differentiable particle filtering, wherein parameters are trained by gradient descent. We design a new differentiable interacting multiple model particle filter to be capable of learning the individual behavioural regimes and the model which controls the jumping simultaneously. In contrast to previous approaches, our algorithm allows control of the computational effort assigned per regime whilst using the probability of being in a given regime to guide sampling. Furthermore, we develop a new gradient estimator that has a lower variance than established approaches and remains fast to compute, for which we prove consistency. We establish new theoretical results of the presented algorithms and demonstrate superior numerical performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Comparing Differentiable and Dynamic Ray Tracing: Introducing the Multipath Lifetime Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14535v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing presence of dynamic scenarios, such as Vehicle-to-Vehicle communications, radio propagation modeling tools must adapt to the rapidly changing nature of the radio channel. Recently, both Differentiable and Dynamic Ray Tracing frameworks have emerged to address these challenges. However, there is often confusion about how these approaches differ and which one should be used in specific contexts. In this paper, we provide an overview of these two techniques and a comparative analysis against two state-of-the-art tools: 3DSCAT from UniBo and Sionna from NVIDIA. To provide a more precise characterization of the scope of these methods, we introduce a novel simulation-based metric, the Multipath Lifetime Map, which enables the evaluation of spatial and temporal coherence in radio channels only based on the geometrical description of the environment. Finally, our metrics are evaluated on a classic urban street canyon scenario, yielding similar results to those obtained from measurement campaigns.</description>

      <title>MagicPIG: LSH Sampling for Efficient LLM Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16179v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with long context windows have gained significant attention. However, the KV cache, stored to avoid re-computation, becomes a bottleneck. Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attention approximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight that attention is sparse. In this paper, we first show that TopK attention itself suffers from quality degradation in certain downstream tasks because attention is not always as sparse as expected. Rather than selecting the keys and values with the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees can provide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-based approximation practical in LLM generation, we propose MagicPIG, a heterogeneous system based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantly reduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracy for diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attention computation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and larger batch sizes with high approximation accuracy. MagicPIG can improve decoding throughput by up to $5\times$ across various GPU hardware and achieve 54ms decoding latency on a single RTX 4090 for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with a context of 96k tokens. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/MagicPIG.</description>

      <title>Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) is a time-efficient approach to quantitative MRI, enabling the mapping of multiple tissue properties from a single, accelerated scan. However, achieving accurate reconstructions remains challenging, particularly in highly accelerated and undersampled acquisitions, which are crucial for reducing scan times. While deep learning techniques have advanced image reconstruction, the recent introduction of diffusion models offers new possibilities for imaging tasks, though their application in the medical field is still emerging. Notably, diffusion models have not yet been explored for the MRF problem. In this work, we propose for the first time a conditional diffusion probabilistic model for MRF image reconstruction. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons on in-vivo brain scan data demonstrate that the proposed approach can outperform established deep learning and compressed sensing algorithms for MRF reconstruction. Extensive ablation studies also explore strategies to improve computational efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <title>HeartBERT: A Self-Supervised ECG Embedding Model for Efficient and Effective Medical Signal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The HeartBert model is introduced with three primary objectives: reducing the need for labeled data, minimizing computational resources, and simultaneously improving performance in machine learning systems that analyze Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Inspired by Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) in natural language processing and enhanced with a self-supervised learning approach, the HeartBert model-built on the RoBERTa architecture-generates sophisticated embeddings tailored for ECG-based projects in the medical domain. To demonstrate the versatility, generalizability, and efficiency of the proposed model, two key downstream tasks have been selected: sleep stage detection and heartbeat classification. HeartBERT-based systems, utilizing bidirectional LSTM heads, are designed to address complex challenges. A series of practical experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superiority and advancements of HeartBERT, particularly in terms of its ability to perform well with smaller training datasets, reduced learning parameters, and effective performance compared to rival models. The code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/ecgResearch/HeartBert.</description>

      <title>DyCoke: Dynamic Compression of Tokens for Fast Video Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in processing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains constrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands of visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that, unlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different frames at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy prone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA counterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against the baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.</description>

      <title>RelCon: Relative Contrastive Learning for a Motion Foundation Model for Wearable Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18822v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present RelCon, a novel self-supervised *Rel*ative *Con*trastive learning approach that uses a learnable distance measure in combination with a softened contrastive loss for training an motion foundation model from wearable sensors. The learnable distance measure captures motif similarity and domain-specific semantic information such as rotation invariance. The learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometer time-series segments, which is used to measure the distance between an anchor and various other sampled candidate segments. The self-supervised model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants from a large wearables dataset. The model achieves strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, encompassing both classification and regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the generalizability of a self-supervised learning model with motion data from wearables across distinct evaluation tasks.</description>

      <title>Sinkhorn Algorithm for Sequentially Composed Optimal Transports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03120v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sinkhorn algorithm is the de-facto standard approximation algorithm for optimal transport, which has been applied to a variety of applications, including image processing and natural language processing. In theory, the proof of its convergence follows from the convergence of the Sinkhorn--Knopp algorithm for the matrix scaling problem, and Altschuler et al. show that its worst-case time complexity is in near-linear time. Very recently, sequentially composed optimal transports were proposed by Watanabe and Isobe as a hierarchical extension of optimal transports. In this paper, we present an efficient approximation algorithm, namely Sinkhorn algorithm for sequentially composed optimal transports, for its entropic regularization. Furthermore, we present a theoretical analysis of the Sinkhorn algorithm, namely (i) its exponential convergence to the optimal solution with respect to the Hilbert pseudometric, and (ii) a worst-case complexity analysis for the case of one sequential composition.</description>

      <title>The Tile: A 2D Map of Ranking Scores for Two-Class Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the computer vision and machine learning communities, as well as in many other research domains, rigorous evaluation of any new method, including classifiers, is essential. One key component of the evaluation process is the ability to compare and rank methods. However, ranking classifiers and accurately comparing their performances, especially when taking application-specific preferences into account, remains challenging. For instance, commonly used evaluation tools like Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision/Recall (PR) spaces display performances based on two scores. Hence, they are inherently limited in their ability to compare classifiers across a broader range of scores and lack the capability to establish a clear ranking among classifiers. In this paper, we present a novel versatile tool, named the Tile, that organizes an infinity of ranking scores in a single 2D map for two-class classifiers, including common evaluation scores such as the accuracy, the true positive rate, the positive predictive value, Jaccard's coefficient, and all F-beta scores. Furthermore, we study the properties of the underlying ranking scores, such as the influence of the priors or the correspondences with the ROC space, and depict how to characterize any other score by comparing them to the Tile. Overall, we demonstrate that the Tile is a powerful tool that effectively captures all the rankings in a single visualization and allows interpreting them.</description>

      <title>A Hitchhiker's Guide to Understanding Performances of Two-Class Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Properly understanding the performances of classifiers is essential in various scenarios. However, the literature often relies only on one or two standard scores to compare classifiers, which fails to capture the nuances of application-specific requirements, potentially leading to suboptimal classifier selection. Recently, a paper on the foundations of the theory of performance-based ranking introduced a tool, called the Tile, that organizes an infinity of ranking scores into a 2D map. Thanks to the Tile, it is now possible to evaluate and compare classifiers efficiently, displaying all possible application-specific preferences instead of having to rely on a pair of scores. In this paper, we provide a first hitchhiker's guide for understanding the performances of two-class classifiers by presenting four scenarios, each showcasing a different user profile: a theoretical analyst, a method designer, a benchmarker, and an application developer. Particularly, we show that we can provide different interpretative flavors that are adapted to the user's needs by mapping different values on the Tile. As an illustration, we leverage the newly introduced Tile tool and the different flavors to rank and analyze the performances of 74 state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models in two-class classification through the eyes of the four user profiles. Through these user profiles, we demonstrate that the Tile effectively captures the behavior of classifiers in a single visualization, while accommodating an infinite number of ranking scores.</description>

      <title>FM2DS: Few-Shot Multimodal Multihop Data Synthesis with Knowledge Distillation for Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal multihop question answering is a complex task that requires reasoning over multiple sources of information, such as images and text, to answer questions. While there has been significant progress in visual question answering, the multihop setting remains unexplored due to the lack of high-quality datasets. Current methods focus on single-hop question answering or a single modality, which makes them unsuitable for real-world scenarios such as analyzing multimodal educational materials, summarizing lengthy academic articles, or interpreting scientific studies that combine charts, images, and text. To address this gap, we propose a novel methodology, introducing the first framework for creating a high-quality dataset that enables training models for multimodal multihop question answering. Our approach consists of a 5-stage pipeline that involves acquiring relevant multimodal documents from Wikipedia, synthetically generating high-level questions and answers, and validating them through rigorous criteria to ensure quality data. We evaluate our methodology by training models on our synthesized dataset and testing on two benchmarks, our results demonstrate that, with an equal sample size, models trained on our synthesized data outperform those trained on human-collected data by 1.9 in exact match (EM) on average. We believe our data synthesis method will serve as a strong foundation for training and evaluating multimodal multihop question answering models.</description>

      <title>Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via In-Sample Sequential Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is an emerging field that aims to learn optimal multi-agent policies from pre-collected datasets. Compared to single-agent case, multi-agent setting involves a large joint state-action space and coupled behaviors of multiple agents, which bring extra complexity to offline policy optimization. In this work, we revisit the existing offline MARL methods and show that in certain scenarios they can be problematic, leading to uncoordinated behaviors and out-of-distribution (OOD) joint actions. To address these issues, we propose a new offline MARL algorithm, named In-Sample Sequential Policy Optimization (InSPO). InSPO sequentially updates each agent's policy in an in-sample manner, which not only avoids selecting OOD joint actions but also carefully considers teammates' updated policies to enhance coordination. Additionally, by thoroughly exploring low-probability actions in the behavior policy, InSPO can well address the issue of premature convergence to sub-optimal solutions. Theoretically, we prove InSPO guarantees monotonic policy improvement and converges to quantal response equilibrium (QRE). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to current state-of-the-art offline MARL methods.</description>

      <title>RAZOR: Sharpening Knowledge by Cutting Bias with Unsupervised Text Rewriting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the widespread use of LLMs due to their superior performance in various tasks, their high computational costs often lead potential users to opt for the pretraining-finetuning pipeline. However, biases prevalent in manually constructed datasets can introduce spurious correlations between tokens and labels, creating so-called shortcuts and hindering the generalizability of fine-tuned models. Existing debiasing methods often rely on prior knowledge of specific dataset biases, which is challenging to acquire a priori. We propose RAZOR (Rewriting And Zero-bias Optimization Refinement), a novel, unsupervised, and data-focused debiasing approach based on text rewriting for shortcut mitigation. RAZOR leverages LLMs to iteratively rewrite potentially biased text segments by replacing them with heuristically selected alternatives in a shortcut space defined by token statistics and positional information. This process aims to align surface-level text features more closely with diverse label distributions, thereby promoting the learning of genuine linguistic patterns. Compared with unsupervised SoTA models, RAZOR improves by 3.5% on the FEVER and 6.5% on MNLI and SNLI datasets according to the F1 score. Additionally, RAZOR effectively mitigates specific known biases, reducing bias-related terms by x2 without requiring prior bias information, a result that is on par with SoTA models that leverage prior information. Our work prioritizes data manipulation over architectural modifications, emphasizing the pivotal role of data quality in enhancing model performance and fairness. This research contributes to developing more robust evaluation benchmarks for debiasing methods by incorporating metrics for bias reduction and overall model efficacy.</description>

      <title>Efficient Gravitational Wave Parameter Estimation via Knowledge Distillation: A ResNet1D-IAF Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of gravitational wave astronomy, the increasing number of detected events necessitates efficient methods for parameter estimation and model updates. This study presents a novel approach using knowledge distillation techniques to enhance computational efficiency in gravitational wave analysis. We develop a framework combining ResNet1D and Inverse Autoregressive Flow (IAF) architectures, where knowledge from a complex teacher model is transferred to a lighter student model. Our experimental results show that the student model achieves a validation loss of 3.70 with optimal configuration (40,100,0.75), compared to the teacher model's 4.09, while reducing the number of parameters by 43\%. The Jensen-Shannon divergence between teacher and student models remains below 0.0001 across network layers, indicating successful knowledge transfer. By optimizing ResNet layers (7-16) and hidden features (70-120), we achieve a 35\% reduction in inference time while maintaining parameter estimation accuracy. This work demonstrates significant improvements in computational efficiency for gravitational wave data analysis, providing valuable insights for real-time event processing.</description>

      <title>Let Curves Speak: A Continuous Glucose Monitor based Large Sensor Foundation Model for Diabetes Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While previous studies of AI in diabetes management focus on long-term risk, research on near-future glucose prediction remains limited but important as it enables timely diabetes self-management. Integrating AI with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) holds promise for near-future glucose prediction. However, existing models have limitations in capturing patterns of blood glucose fluctuations and demonstrate poor generalizability. A robust approach is needed to leverage massive CGM data for near-future glucose prediction. We propose large sensor models (LSMs) to capture knowledge in CGM data by modeling patients as sequences of glucose. CGM-LSM is pretrained on 15.96 million glucose records from 592 diabetes patients for near-future glucose prediction. We evaluated CGM-LSM against state-of-the-art methods using the OhioT1DM dataset across various metrics, prediction horizons, and unseen patients. Additionally, we assessed its generalizability across factors like diabetes type, age, gender, and hour of day. CGM-LSM achieved exceptional performance, with an rMSE of 29.81 mg/dL for type 1 diabetes patients and 23.49 mg/dL for type 2 diabetes patients in a two-hour prediction horizon. For the OhioT1DM dataset, CGM-LSM achieved a one-hour rMSE of 15.64 mg/dL, halving the previous best of 31.97 mg/dL. Robustness analyses revealed consistent performance not only for unseen patients and future periods, but also across diabetes type, age, and gender. The model demonstrated adaptability to different hours of day, maintaining accuracy across periods of various activity intensity levels. CGM-LSM represents a transformative step in diabetes management by leveraging pretraining to uncover latent glucose generation patterns in sensor data. Our findings also underscore the broader potential of LSMs to drive innovation across domains involving complex sensor data.</description>

      <title>CosyVoice 2: Scalable Streaming Speech Synthesis with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous work, we introduced CosyVoice, a multilingual speech synthesis model based on supervised discrete speech tokens. By employing progressive semantic decoding with two popular generative models, language models (LMs) and Flow Matching, CosyVoice demonstrated high prosody naturalness, content consistency, and speaker similarity in speech in-context learning. Recently, significant progress has been made in multi-modal large language models (LLMs), where the response latency and real-time factor of speech synthesis play a crucial role in the interactive experience. Therefore, in this report, we present an improved streaming speech synthesis model, CosyVoice 2, which incorporates comprehensive and systematic optimizations. Specifically, we introduce finite-scalar quantization to improve the codebook utilization of speech tokens. For the text-speech LM, we streamline the model architecture to allow direct use of a pre-trained LLM as the backbone. In addition, we develop a chunk-aware causal flow matching model to support various synthesis scenarios, enabling both streaming and non-streaming synthesis within a single model. By training on a large-scale multilingual dataset, CosyVoice 2 achieves human-parity naturalness, minimal response latency, and virtually lossless synthesis quality in the streaming mode. We invite readers to listen to the demos at https://funaudiollm.github.io/cosyvoice2.</description>

      <title>Combining Priors with Experience: Confidence Calibration Based on Binomial Process Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confidence calibration of classification models is a technique to estimate the true posterior probability of the predicted class, which is critical for ensuring reliable decision-making in practical applications. Existing confidence calibration methods mostly use statistical techniques to estimate the calibration curve from data or fit a user-defined calibration function, but often overlook fully mining and utilizing the prior distribution behind the calibration curve. However, a well-informed prior distribution can provide valuable insights beyond the empirical data under the limited data or low-density regions of confidence scores. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a new method that integrates the prior distribution behind the calibration curve with empirical data to estimate a continuous calibration curve, which is realized by modeling the sampling process of calibration data as a binomial process and maximizing the likelihood function of the binomial process. We prove that the calibration curve estimating method is Lipschitz continuous with respect to data distribution and requires a sample size of $3/B$ of that required for histogram binning, where $B$ represents the number of bins. Also, a new calibration metric ($TCE_{bpm}$), which leverages the estimated calibration curve to estimate the true calibration error (TCE), is designed. $TCE_{bpm}$ is proven to be a consistent calibration measure. Furthermore, realistic calibration datasets can be generated by the binomial process modeling from a preset true calibration curve and confidence score distribution, which can serve as a benchmark to measure and compare the discrepancy between existing calibration metrics and the true calibration error. The effectiveness of our calibration method and metric are verified in real-world and simulated data.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion generative models are currently the most popular generative models. However, their underlying modeling process is quite complex, and starting directly with the seminal paper Denoising Diffusion Probability Model (DDPM) can be challenging. This paper aims to assist readers in building a foundational understanding of generative models by tracing the evolution from VAEs to DDPM through detailed mathematical derivations and a problem-oriented analytical approach. It also explores the core ideas and improvement strategies of current mainstream methodologies, providing guidance for undergraduate and graduate students interested in learning about diffusion models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been the standard for image classification tasks for a long time, but more recently attention-based mechanisms have gained traction. This project aims to compare traditional CNNs with attention-augmented CNNs across an image classification task. By evaluating and comparing their performance, accuracy and computational efficiency, the project will highlight benefits and trade-off of the localized feature extraction of traditional CNNs and the global context capture in attention-augmented CNNs. By doing this, we can reveal further insights into their respective strengths and weaknesses, guide the selection of models based on specific application needs and ultimately, enhance understanding of these architectures in the deep learning community.

      <title>Conditional Diffusion Models Based Conditional Independence Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conditional independence (CI) testing is a fundamental task in modern statistics and machine learning. The conditional randomization test (CRT) was recently introduced to test whether two random variables, $X$ and $Y$, are conditionally independent given a potentially high-dimensional set of random variables, $Z$. The CRT operates exceptionally well under the assumption that the conditional distribution $X|Z$ is known. However, since this distribution is typically unknown in practice, accurately approximating it becomes crucial. In this paper, we propose using conditional diffusion models (CDMs) to learn the distribution of $X|Z$. Theoretically and empirically, it is shown that CDMs closely approximate the true conditional distribution. Furthermore, CDMs offer a more accurate approximation of $X|Z$ compared to GANs, potentially leading to a CRT that performs better than those based on GANs. To accommodate complex dependency structures, we utilize a computationally efficient classifier-based conditional mutual information (CMI) estimator as our test statistic. The proposed testing procedure performs effectively without requiring assumptions about specific distribution forms or feature dependencies, and is capable of handling mixed-type conditioning sets that include both continuous and discrete variables. Theoretical analysis shows that our proposed test achieves a valid control of the type I error. A series of experiments on synthetic data demonstrates that our new test effectively controls both type-I and type-II errors, even in high dimensional scenarios.</description>

      <title>SepLLM: Accelerate Large Language Models by Compressing One Segment into One Separator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Abstractions: Concept Encoding and Decoding Mechanism for In-Context Learning in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans distill complex experiences into fundamental abstractions that enable rapid learning and adaptation. Similarly, autoregressive transformers exhibit adaptive learning through in-context learning (ICL), which begs the question of how. In this paper, we propose concept encoding-decoding mechanism to explain ICL by studying how transformers form and use internal abstractions in their representations. On synthetic ICL tasks, we analyze the training dynamics of a small transformer and report the coupled emergence of concept encoding and decoding. As the model learns to encode different latent concepts (e.g., ``Finding the first noun in a sentence.") into distinct, separable representations, it concureently builds conditional decoding algorithms and improve its ICL performance. We validate the existence of this mechanism across pretrained models of varying scales (Gemma-2 2B/9B/27B, Llama-3.1 8B/70B). Further, through mechanistic interventions and controlled finetuning, we demonstrate that the quality of concept encoding is causally related and predictive of ICL performance. Our empirical insights shed light into better understanding the success and failure modes of large language models via their representations.</description>

      <title>BanglishRev: A Large-Scale Bangla-English and Code-mixed Dataset of Product Reviews in E-Commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents the BanglishRev Dataset, the largest e-commerce product review dataset to date for reviews written in Bengali, English, a mixture of both and Banglish, Bengali words written with English alphabets. The dataset comprises of 1.74 million written reviews from 3.2 million ratings information collected from a total of 128k products being sold in online e-commerce platforms targeting the Bengali population. It includes an extensive array of related metadata for each of the reviews including the rating given by the reviewer, date the review was posted and date of purchase, number of likes, dislikes, response from the seller, images associated with the review etc. With sentiment analysis being the most prominent usage of review datasets, experimentation with a binary sentiment analysis model with the review rating serving as an indicator of positive or negative sentiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the large amount of data presented in BanglishRev for sentiment analysis tasks. A BanglishBERT model is trained on the data from BanglishRev with reviews being considered labeled positive if the rating is greater than 3 and negative if the rating is less than or equal to 3. The model is evaluated by being testing against a previously published manually annotated dataset for e-commerce reviews written in a mixture of Bangla, English and Banglish. The experimental model achieved an exceptional accuracy of 94\% and F1 score of 0.94, demonstrating the dataset's efficacy for sentiment analysis. Some of the intriguing patterns and observations seen within the dataset and future research directions where the dataset can be utilized is also discussed and explored. The dataset can be accessed through https://huggingface.co/datasets/BanglishRev/bangla-english-and-code-mixed-ecommerce-review-dataset.</description>

      <title>HandsOnVLM: Vision-Language Models for Hand-Object Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we predict future interaction trajectories of human hands in a scene given high-level colloquial task specifications in the form of natural language? In this paper, we extend the classic hand trajectory prediction task to two tasks involving explicit or implicit language queries. Our proposed tasks require extensive understanding of human daily activities and reasoning abilities about what should be happening next given cues from the current scene. We also develop new benchmarks to evaluate the proposed two tasks, Vanilla Hand Prediction (VHP) and Reasoning-Based Hand Prediction (RBHP). We enable solving these tasks by integrating high-level world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with the auto-regressive nature of low-level ego-centric hand trajectories. Our model, HandsOnVLM is a novel VLM that can generate textual responses and produce future hand trajectories through natural-language conversations. Our experiments show that HandsOnVLM outperforms existing task-specific methods and other VLM baselines on proposed tasks, and demonstrates its ability to effectively utilize world knowledge for reasoning about low-level human hand trajectories based on the provided context.
