      <title>DrDiff: Dynamic Routing Diffusion with Hierarchical Attention for Breaking the Efficiency-Quality Trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces DrDiff, a novel framework for long-text generation that overcomes the efficiency-quality trade-off through three core technologies. First, we design a dynamic expert scheduling mechanism that intelligently allocates computational resources during the diffusion process based on text complexity, enabling more efficient handling of text generation tasks of varying difficulty. Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA) mechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of input lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while maintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance optimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion steps, significantly improving generation speed. Comprehensive experiments on various long-text generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our DrDiff over the existing SOTA methods.</description>

      <title>SSVD: Structured SVD for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and Benchmarking under Domain Shift in ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a scalable solution for adapting large foundation models. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is widely used in speech applications, its state-of-the-art variants, e.g., VeRA, DoRA, PiSSA, and SVFT, are developed mainly for language and vision tasks, with limited validation in speech. This work presents the first comprehensive integration and benchmarking of these PEFT methods within ESPnet. We further introduce structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning, which selectively rotates input-associated right singular vectors while keeping output-associated vectors fixed to preserve semantic mappings. This design enables robust domain adaptation with minimal trainable parameters and improved efficiency. We evaluate all methods on domain-shifted speech recognition tasks, including child speech and dialectal variation, across model scales from 0.1B to 2B. All implementations are released in ESPnet to support reproducibility and future work.</description>

      <title>Clustering Discourses: Racial Biases in Short Stories about Women Generated by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how large language models, in particular LLaMA 3.2-3B, construct narratives about Black and white women in short stories generated in Portuguese. From 2100 texts, we applied computational methods to group semantically similar stories, allowing a selection for qualitative analysis. Three main discursive representations emerge: social overcoming, ancestral mythification and subjective self-realization. The analysis uncovers how grammatically coherent, seemingly neutral texts materialize a crystallized, colonially structured framing of the female body, reinforcing historical inequalities. The study proposes an integrated approach, that combines machine learning techniques with qualitative, manual discourse analysis.</description>

      <title>IDEAlign: Comparing Large Language Models to Human Experts in Open-ended Interpretive Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to open-ended, interpretive annotation tasks, such as thematic analysis by researchers or generating feedback on student work by teachers. These tasks involve free-text annotations requiring expert-level judgments grounded in specific objectives (e.g., research questions or instructional goals). Evaluating whether LLM-generated annotations align with those generated by expert humans is challenging to do at scale, and currently, no validated, scalable measure of similarity in ideas exists. In this paper, we (i) introduce the scalable evaluation of interpretive annotation by LLMs as a critical and understudied task, (ii) propose IDEAlgin, an intuitive benchmarking paradigm for capturing expert similarity ratings via a "pick-the-odd-one-out" triplet judgment task, and (iii) evaluate various similarity metrics, including vector-based ones (topic models, embeddings) and LLM-as-a-judge via IDEAlgin, against these human benchmarks. Applying this approach to two real-world educational datasets (interpretive analysis and feedback generation), we find that vector-based metrics largely fail to capture the nuanced dimensions of similarity meaningful to experts. Prompting LLMs via IDEAlgin significantly improves alignment with expert judgments (9-30% increase) compared to traditional lexical and vector-based metrics. These results establish IDEAlgin as a promising paradigm for evaluating LLMs against open-ended expert annotations at scale, informing responsible deployment of LLMs in education and beyond.</description>

      <title>A-SEA3L-QA: A Fully Automated Self-Evolving, Adversarial Workflow for Arabic Long-Context Question-Answer Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an end-to-end, self-evolving adversarial workflow for long-context Question-Answer (QA) Generation in Arabic. By orchestrating multiple specialized LVLMs: a question generator, an evaluator, and a swarm of answer generators, our system iteratively refines its own performance without any human intervention. Starting from raw, multi-page Arabic documents across diverse domains, the question generator produces fine-grained, context-aware queries to be tackled by the answer generator swarm, and the evaluator assesses and feeds back quality metrics. This closed-loop cycle enables continuous learning: low-confidence outputs trigger automated re-generation and model updates, progressively enhancing question difficulty and relevance. Moreover, we set the quality metrics as a tunable hyperparameter, enabling question generation at controllable and customizable difficulty levels. We release AraLongBench, a large-scale Arabic benchmark of single- and multi-page challenges spanning hundreds of pages, and demonstrate that our self-evolving workflow substantially outperform static pipelines, markedly boosting the long-context comprehension capabilities of leading Arabic Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). Lastly, we also meticulously architect a fully automated agentic workflow for long-context Arabic document collection.</description>

      <title>Advancing Minority Stress Detection with Transformers: Insights from the Social Media Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individuals from sexual and gender minority groups experience disproportionately high rates of poor health outcomes and mental disorders compared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, largely as a consequence of minority stress as described by Meyer's (2003) model. This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based architectures for detecting minority stress in online discourse. We benchmark multiple transformer models including ELECTRA, BERT, RoBERTa, and BART against traditional machine learning baselines and graph-augmented variants. We further assess zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms to assess their applicability on underrepresented datasets. Experiments are conducted on the two largest publicly available Reddit corpora for minority stress detection, comprising 12,645 and 5,789 posts, and are repeated over five random seeds to ensure robustness. Our results demonstrate that integrating graph structure consistently improves detection performance across transformer-only models and that supervised fine-tuning with relational context outperforms zero and few-shot approaches. Theoretical analysis reveals that modeling social connectivity and conversational context via graph augmentation sharpens the models' ability to identify key linguistic markers such as identity concealment, internalized stigma, and calls for support, suggesting that graph-enhanced transformers offer the most reliable foundation for digital health interventions and public health policy.</description>

      <title>English Pronunciation Evaluation without Complex Joint Training: LoRA Fine-tuned Speech Multimodal LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates that a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adapted via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can perform both Automatic Pronunciation Assessment (APA) and Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD) simultaneously. Leveraging Microsoft's Phi-4-multimodal-instruct, our fine-tuning method eliminates the need for complex architectural changes or separate training procedures conventionally required for these distinct tasks. Fine-tuned on the Speechocean762 dataset, the pronunciation evaluation scores predicted by the model exhibited a strong Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC &gt; 0.7) with human-assigned scores, while achieving low Word Error Rate (WER) and Phoneme Error Rate (PER) (both &lt; 0.15). Notably, fine-tuning only the LoRA layers was sufficient to achieve performance levels comparable to those achieved by fine-tuning all audio layers. This research highlights that an integrated pronunciation assessment system can be established by adapting large multimodal models without full fine-tuning, utilizing a significantly simpler training methodology compared to previous joint models designed for simultaneous APA and MDD. This efficient LoRA-based approach paves the way for more accessible, integrated, and effective Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) technologies for English L2 learners.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Rule Book: Extracting Hidden Moderation Criteria from Reddit Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective content moderation systems require explicit classification criteria, yet online communities like subreddits often operate with diverse, implicit standards. This work introduces a novel approach to identify and extract these implicit criteria from historical moderation data using an interpretable architecture. We represent moderation criteria as score tables of lexical expressions associated with content removal, enabling systematic comparison across different communities. Our experiments demonstrate that these extracted lexical patterns effectively replicate the performance of neural moderation models while providing transparent insights into decision-making processes. The resulting criteria matrix reveals significant variations in how seemingly shared norms are actually enforced, uncovering previously undocumented moderation patterns including community-specific tolerances for language, features for topical restrictions, and underlying subcategories of the toxic speech classification.</description>

      <title>ProMQA-Assembly: Multimodal Procedural QA Dataset on Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assistants on assembly tasks have a large potential to benefit humans from everyday tasks to industrial settings. However, no testbeds support application-oriented system evaluation in a practical setting, especially in assembly. To foster the development, we propose a new multimodal QA dataset on assembly activities. Our dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, consists of 391 QA pairs that require the multimodal understanding of human-activity recordings and their instruction manuals in an online-style manner. In the development, we adopt a semi-automated QA annotation approach, where LLMs generate candidates and humans verify them, as a cost-effective method, and further improve it by integrating fine-grained action labels to diversify question types. Furthermore, we create instruction task graphs for the target tasks of assembling toy vehicles. These newly created task graphs are used in our benchmarking experiment, as well as to facilitate the human verification process in the QA annotation. Utilizing our dataset, we benchmark models, including competitive proprietary multimodal models. Our results suggest great room for improvement for the current models. We believe our new evaluation dataset can contribute to the further development of procedural-activity assistants.</description>

      <title>DiaCBT: A Long-Periodic Dialogue Corpus Guided by Cognitive Conceptualization Diagram for CBT-based Psychological Counseling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Psychotherapy reaches only a small fraction of individuals suffering from mental disorders due to social stigma and the limited availability of therapists. Large language models (LLMs), when equipped with professional psychotherapeutic skills, offer a promising solution to expand access to mental health services. However, the lack of psychological conversation datasets presents significant challenges in developing effective psychotherapy-guided conversational agents. In this paper, we construct a long-periodic dialogue corpus for counseling based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Our curated dataset includes multiple sessions for each counseling and incorporates cognitive conceptualization diagrams (CCDs) to guide client simulation across diverse scenarios. To evaluate the utility of our dataset, we train an in-depth counseling model and present a comprehensive evaluation framework to benchmark it against established psychological criteria for CBT-based counseling. Results demonstrate that DiaCBT effectively enhances LLMs' ability to emulate psychologists with CBT expertise, underscoring its potential for training more professional counseling agents.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Data Imbalance in Automated Speaking Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) plays a crucial role in evaluating second-language (L2) learners proficiency. However, ASA models often suffer from class imbalance, leading to biased predictions. To address this, we introduce a novel objective for training ASA models, dubbed the Balancing Logit Variation (BLV) loss, which perturbs model predictions to improve feature representation for minority classes without modifying the dataset. Evaluations on the ICNALE benchmark dataset show that integrating the BLV loss into a celebrated text-based (BERT) model significantly enhances classification accuracy and fairness, making automated speech evaluation more robust for diverse learners.</description>

      <title>Training LLMs to be Better Text Embedders through Bidirectional Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text embedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS]. However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings, especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks, namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.</description>

      <title>Structure-Learnable Adapter Fine-Tuning for Parameter-Efficient Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of parameter redundancy, rigid structure, and limited task adaptability in the fine-tuning of large language models. It proposes an adapter-based fine-tuning method built on a structure-learnable mechanism. By introducing differentiable gating functions and structural sparsity control variables, the method enables automatic optimization of adapter insertion points, activation paths, and module combinations. This allows the model to adjust its structure flexibly in multi-task settings to match different task characteristics. With the backbone parameters kept frozen, the method uses a structure search mechanism to guide the dynamic construction of task-specific efficient substructures during training. This significantly improves parameter utilization and representational capacity. In addition, the paper designs a set of sensitivity analysis experiments to systematically evaluate the effects of sparsity weight, noise injection ratio, and data perturbation on model performance. These experiments verify the stability and robustness of the proposed method across various multi-task natural language understanding tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms mainstream parameter-efficient tuning techniques on multiple tasks. It achieves a better balance among accuracy, compression rate, and robustness to noise and perturbation.</description>

      <title>A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model for Business Sentiment Analysis Based on Recurrent Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Business sentiment analysis (BSA) is one of the significant and popular topics of natural language processing. It is one kind of sentiment analysis techniques for business purposes. Different categories of sentiment analysis techniques like lexicon-based techniques and different types of machine learning algorithms are applied for sentiment analysis on different languages like English, Hindi, Spanish, etc. In this paper, long short-term memory (LSTM) is applied for business sentiment analysis, where a recurrent neural network is used. An LSTM model is used in a modified approach to prevent the vanishing gradient problem rather than applying the conventional recurrent neural network (RNN). To apply the modified RNN model, product review dataset is used. In this experiment, 70\% of the data is trained for the LSTM and the rest 30\% of the data is used for testing. The result of this modified RNN model is compared with other conventional RNN models, and a comparison is made among the results. It is noted that the proposed model performs better than the other conventional RNN models. Here, the proposed model, i.e., the modified RNN model approach has achieved around 91.33\% of accuracy. By applying this model, any business company or e-commerce business site can identify the feedback from their customers about different types of products that customers like or dislike. Based on the customer reviews, a business company or e-commerce platform can evaluate its marketing strategy.</description>

      <title>Measuring Scalar Constructs in Social Science with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many constructs that characterize language, like its complexity or emotionality, have a naturally continuous semantic structure; a public speech is not just "simple" or "complex," but exists on a continuum between extremes. Although large language models (LLMs) are an attractive tool for measuring scalar constructs, their idiosyncratic treatment of numerical outputs raises questions of how to best apply them. We address these questions with a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based approaches to scalar construct measurement in social science. Using multiple datasets sourced from the political science literature, we evaluate four approaches: unweighted direct pointwise scoring, aggregation of pairwise comparisons, token-probability-weighted pointwise scoring, and finetuning. Our study yields actionable findings for applied researchers. First, LLMs prompted to generate pointwise scores directly from texts produce discontinuous distributions with bunching at arbitrary numbers. The quality of the measurements improves with pairwise comparisons made by LLMs, but it improves even more by taking pointwise scores and weighting them by token probability. Finally, finetuning smaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed the performance of prompted LLMs.</description>

      <title>From Evaluation to Defense: Constructing Persistent Edit-Based Fingerprints for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intellectual property (IP) protection of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly critical. Injecting specialized fingerprints into LLMs through instruction tuning is a common IP protection technique. However, this may significantly degrade model performance, requires substantial computational resources, and exhibits poor persistence under model modifications. We argue that knowledge editing offers a lightweight alternative that is more suitable for fingerprint injection. Accordingly, we apply knowledge editing to fingerprint injection for the first time and demonstrate its strong capability. Despite using scrambled text as fingerprints to prevent them from being overwritten during fine-tuning, degradation still occurs under large-scale fine-tuning. To address this, we propose Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning (FSFT), which reduces fingerprint degradation by constraining the update of the fingerprint subspace. The performance of FSFT exceeds fine-tuning by 10% even in the worst-case scenario. Additionally, we observe that the fingerprint-injected models struggle to distinguish between fingerprints and similar texts due to the high similarity of their features. This finding underscores the urgent need for more robust and fine-grained fingerprinting injection methods for LLMs.</description>

      <title>An experimental and computational study of an Estonian single-person word naming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates lexical processing in Estonian. A large-scale single-subject experiment is reported that combines the word naming task with eye-tracking. Five response variables (first fixation duration, total fixation duration, number of fixations, word naming latency, and spoken word duration) are analyzed with the generalized additive model. Of central interest is the question of whether measures for lexical processing generated by a computational model of the mental lexicon (the Discriminative Lexicon Model, DLM) are predictive for these response variables, and how they compare to classical predictors such as word frequency, neighborhood size, and inflectional paradigm size. Computational models were implemented both with linear and deep mappings. Central findings are, first, that DLM-based measures are powerful predictors for lexical processing, second, that DLM-measures using deep learning are not necessarily more precise predictors of lexical processing than DLM-measures using linear mappings, third, that classical predictors tend to provide somewhat more precise fits compared to DLM-based predictors (except for total fixation duration, where the two provide equivalent goodness of fit), and fourth, that in the naming task lexical variables are not predictive for first fixation duration and the total number of fixations. As the DLM works with mappings from form to meaning, the predictivity of DLM-based measures for total fixation duration, naming latencies, and spoken word duration indicates that meaning is heavily involved in the present word naming task.</description>

      <title>Expanding the WMT24++ Benchmark with Rumantsch Grischun, Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter, and Vallader</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Romansh language, spoken in Switzerland, has limited resources for machine translation evaluation. In this paper, we present a benchmark for six varieties of Romansh: Rumantsch Grischun, a supra-regional variety, and five regional varieties: Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter, and Vallader. Our reference translations were created by human translators based on the WMT24++ benchmark, which ensures parallelism with more than 55 other languages. An automatic evaluation of existing MT systems and LLMs shows that translation out of Romansh into German is handled relatively well for all the varieties, but translation into Romansh is still challenging.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptation of LLMs for Process Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent area of interest across various research domains, including Process Mining (PM). Current applications in PM have predominantly centered on prompt engineering strategies or the transformation of event logs into narrative-style datasets, thereby exploiting the semantic capabilities of LLMs to address diverse tasks. In contrast, this study investigates the direct adaptation of pretrained LLMs to process data without natural language reformulation, motivated by the fact that these models excel in generating sequences of tokens, similar to the objective in PM. More specifically, we focus on parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to mitigate the computational overhead typically associated with such models. Our experimental setup focuses on Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM), and considers both single- and multi-task predictions. The results demonstrate a potential improvement in predictive performance over state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN) approaches and recent narrative-style-based solutions, particularly in the multi-task setting. Additionally, our fine-tuned models exhibit faster convergence and require significantly less hyperparameter optimization.</description>

      <title>SinhalaMMLU: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Multitask Language Understanding in Sinhala</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general knowledge and reasoning abilities, yet their evaluation has predominantly focused on global or anglocentric subjects, often neglecting low-resource languages and culturally specific content. While recent multilingual benchmarks attempt to bridge this gap, many rely on automatic translation, which can introduce errors and misrepresent the original cultural context. To address this, we introduce SinhalaMMLU, the first multiple-choice question answering benchmark designed specifically for Sinhala, a low-resource language. The dataset includes over 7,000 questions spanning secondary to collegiate education levels, aligned with the Sri Lankan national curriculum, and covers six domains and 30 subjects, encompassing both general academic topics and culturally grounded knowledge. We evaluate 26 LLMs on SinhalaMMLU and observe that, while Claude 3.5 sonnet and GPT-4o achieve the highest average accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively, overall model performance remains limited. In particular, models struggle in culturally rich domains such as the Humanities, revealing substantial room for improvement in adapting LLMs to low-resource and culturally specific contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of three end-to-end models developed for the NOCASA 2025 Challenge, aimed at automatic word-level pronunciation assessment for children learning Norwegian as a second language. Our models include an encoder-decoder Siamese architecture (E2E-R), a prefix-tuned direct classification model leveraging pretrained wav2vec2.0 representations, and a novel model integrating alignment-free goodness-of-pronunciation (GOP) features computed via CTC. We introduce a weighted ordinal cross-entropy loss tailored for optimizing metrics such as unweighted average recall and mean absolute error. Among the explored methods, our GOP-CTC-based model achieved the highest performance, substantially surpassing challenge baselines and attaining top leaderboard scores.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion is a key front-end for text-to-speech (TTS), automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) and alignment systems, especially across multiple Latin-script languages.We present LatPhon, a 7.5 M - parameter Transformer jointly trained on six such languages--English, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian. On the public ipa-dict corpus, it attains a mean phoneme error rate (PER) of 3.5%, outperforming the byte-level ByT5 baseline (5.4%) and approaching language-specific WFSTs (3.2%) while occupying 30 MB of memory, which makes on-device deployment feasible when needed. These results indicate that compact multilingual G2P can serve as a universal front-end for Latin-language speech pipelines.</description>

      <title>AgenTracer: Who Is Inducing Failure in the LLM Agentic Systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems, often comprising multiple models, complex tool invocations, and orchestration protocols, substantially outperform monolithic agents. Yet this very sophistication amplifies their fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning, capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions. On the Who&amp;When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving agentic AI.</description>

      <title>LMEnt: A Suite for Analyzing Knowledge in Language Models from Pretraining Data to Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) increasingly drive real-world applications that require world knowledge. However, the internal processes through which models turn data into representations of knowledge and beliefs about the world, are poorly understood. Insights into these processes could pave the way for developing LMs with knowledge representations that are more consistent, robust, and complete. To facilitate studying these questions, we present LMEnt, a suite for analyzing knowledge acquisition in LMs during pretraining. LMEnt introduces: (1) a knowledge-rich pretraining corpus, fully annotated with entity mentions, based on Wikipedia, (2) an entity-based retrieval method over pretraining data that outperforms previous approaches by as much as 80.4%, and (3) 12 pretrained models with up to 1B parameters and 4K intermediate checkpoints, with comparable performance to popular open-sourced models on knowledge benchmarks. Together, these resources provide a controlled environment for analyzing connections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance, and the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. We show the utility of LMEnt by studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, finding that fact frequency is key, but does not fully explain learning trends. We release LMEnt to support studies of knowledge in LMs, including knowledge representations, plasticity, editing, attribution, and learning dynamics.</description>

      <title>Learning Mechanism Underlying NLP Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) enables the understanding and generation of meaningful human language, typically using a pre-trained complex architecture on a large dataset to learn the language and next fine-tune its weights to implement a specific task. Twofold goals are examined; to understand the mechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay between the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks. The following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT) increased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over all tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which increased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among tokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as inferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened along the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance considerably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently, higher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though the learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token. These pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy along the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction confidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input meaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match tokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image classification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in fine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality. The results were based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and fine-tuned on the FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Curse of Knowledge: When Complex Evaluation Context Benefits yet Biases LLM Judges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, they face increasingly diverse and complex tasks, making reliable evaluation challenging. The paradigm of LLMs as judges has emerged as a scalable solution, yet prior work primarily focuses on simple settings. Their reliability in complex tasks--where multi-faceted rubrics, unstructured reference answers, and nuanced criteria are critical--remains understudied. In this paper, we constructed ComplexEval, a challenge benchmark designed to systematically expose and quantify Auxiliary Information Induced Biases. We systematically investigated and validated 6 previously unexplored biases across 12 basic and 3 advanced scenarios. Key findings reveal: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant susceptibility to these biases, with bias magnitude scaling with task complexity; (2) notably, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) show paradoxical vulnerability. Our in-depth analysis offers crucial insights for improving the accuracy and verifiability of evaluation signals, paving the way for more general and robust evaluation models.</description>

      <title>Continuous Saudi Sign Language Recognition: A Vision Transformer Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sign language (SL) is an essential communication form for hearing-impaired and deaf people, enabling engagement within the broader society. Despite its significance, limited public awareness of SL often leads to inequitable access to educational and professional opportunities, thereby contributing to social exclusion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where over 84,000 individuals depend on Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although certain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for individuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent requirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially for Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions have primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a considerable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language, specifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of isolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of continuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research represents an important step in developing SSL resources. To address this, we introduce the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset called KAU-CSSL, focusing on complete sentences to facilitate further research and enable sophisticated recognition systems for SSL recognition and translation. Additionally, we propose a transformer-based model, utilizing a pretrained ResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder with Bidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving 99.02\% accuracy at signer dependent mode and 77.71\% accuracy at signer independent mode. This development leads the way to not only improving communication tools for the SSL community but also making a substantial contribution to the wider field of sign language.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI technology advances, research in playing text-based games with agents has becomeprogressively popular. In this paper, a novel approach to agent design and agent learning ispresented with the context of reinforcement learning. A model of deep learning is first applied toprocess game text and build a world model. Next, the agent is learned through a policy gradient-based deep reinforcement learning method to facilitate conversion from state value to optimal policy.The enhanced agent works better in several text-based game experiments and significantlysurpasses previous agents on game completion ratio and win rate. Our study introduces novelunderstanding and empirical ground for using reinforcement learning for text games and sets thestage for developing and optimizing reinforcement learning agents for more general domains andproblems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel to the development of advanced deepfake audio generation, audio deepfake detection has also seen significant progress. However, a standardized and comprehensive benchmark is still missing. To address this, we introduce Speech DeepFake (DF) Arena, the first comprehensive benchmark for audio deepfake detection. Speech DF Arena provides a toolkit to uniformly evaluate detection systems, currently across 14 diverse datasets and attack scenarios, standardized evaluation metrics and protocols for reproducibility and transparency. It also includes a leaderboard to compare and rank the systems to help researchers and developers enhance their reliability and robustness. We include 14 evaluation sets, 12 state-of-the-art open-source and 3 proprietary detection systems. Our study presents many systems exhibiting high EER in out-of-domain scenarios, highlighting the need for extensive cross-domain evaluation. The leaderboard is hosted on Huggingface1 and a toolkit for reproducing results across the listed datasets is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Identifiability and minimality bounds of quantum and post-quantum models of classical stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To make sense of the world around us, we develop models, constructed to enable us to replicate, describe, and explain the behaviours we see. Focusing on the broad case of sequences of correlated random variables, i.e., classical stochastic processes, we tackle the question of determining whether or not two different models produce the same observable behavior. This is the problem of identifiability. Curiously, the physics of the model need not correspond to the physics of the observations; recent work has shown that it is even advantageous -- in terms of memory and thermal efficiency -- to employ quantum models to generate classical stochastic processes. We resolve the identifiability problem in this regime, providing a means to compare any two models of a classical process, be the models classical, quantum, or `post-quantum', by mapping them to a canonical `generalized' hidden Markov model. Further, this enables us to place (sometimes tight) bounds on the minimal dimension required of a quantum model to generate a given classical stochastic process.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Multimodal Hallucinations via Gradient-based Self-Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.</description>

      <title>SESGO: Spanish Evaluation of Stereotypical Generative Outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical gap in evaluating bias in multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), with a specific focus on Spanish language within culturally-aware Latin American contexts. Despite widespread global deployment, current evaluations remain predominantly US-English-centric, leaving potential harms in other linguistic and cultural contexts largely underexamined. We introduce a novel, culturally-grounded framework for detecting social biases in instruction-tuned LLMs. Our approach adapts the underspecified question methodology from the BBQ dataset by incorporating culturally-specific expressions and sayings that encode regional stereotypes across four social categories: gender, race, socioeconomic class, and national origin. Using more than 4,000 prompts, we propose a new metric that combines accuracy with the direction of error to effectively balance model performance and bias alignment in both ambiguous and disambiguated contexts. To our knowledge, our work presents the first systematic evaluation examining how leading commercial LLMs respond to culturally specific bias in the Spanish language, revealing varying patterns of bias manifestation across state-of-the-art models. We also contribute evidence that bias mitigation techniques optimized for English do not effectively transfer to Spanish tasks, and that bias patterns remain largely consistent across different sampling temperatures. Our modular framework offers a natural extension to new stereotypes, bias categories, or languages and cultural contexts, representing a significant step toward more equitable and culturally-aware evaluation of AI systems in the diverse linguistic environments where they operate.</description>

      <title>Language Models Do Not Follow Occam's Razor: A Benchmark for Inductive and Abductive Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However, most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs' inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.</description>

      <title>Situating AI Agents in their World: Aspective Agentic AI for Dynamic Partially Observable Information Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic LLM AI agents are often little more than autonomous chatbots: actors following scripts, often controlled by an unreliable director. This work introduces a bottom-up framework that situates AI agents in their environment, with all behaviors triggered by changes in their environments. It introduces the notion of aspects, similar to the idea of umwelt, where sets of agents perceive their environment differently to each other, enabling clearer control of information. We provide an illustrative implementation and show that compared to a typical architecture, which leaks up to 83% of the time, aspective agentic AI enables zero information leakage. We anticipate that this concept of specialist agents working efficiently in their own information niches can provide improvements to both security and efficiency.</description>

      <title>LimiX: Unleashing Structured-Data Modeling Capability for Generalist Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured data. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid, training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio, missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification, regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.</description>

      <title>Similarity between Units of Natural Language: The Transition from Coarse to Fine Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Capturing the similarities between human language units is crucial for explaining how humans associate different objects, and therefore its computation has received extensive attention, research, and applications. With the ever-increasing amount of information around us, calculating similarity becomes increasingly complex, especially in many cases, such as legal or medical affairs, measuring similarity requires extra care and precision, as small acts within a language unit can have significant real-world effects. My research goal in this thesis is to develop regression models that account for similarities between language units in a more refined way.
  Computation of similarity has come a long way, but approaches to debugging the measures are often based on continually fitting human judgment values. To this end, my goal is to develop an algorithm that precisely catches loopholes in a similarity calculation. Furthermore, most methods have vague definitions of the similarities they compute and are often difficult to interpret. The proposed framework addresses both shortcomings. It constantly improves the model through catching different loopholes. In addition, every refinement of the model provides a reasonable explanation. The regression model introduced in this thesis is called progressively refined similarity computation, which combines attack testing with adversarial training. The similarity regression model of this thesis achieves state-of-the-art performance in handling edge cases.</description>

      <title>Learn and Unlearn: Addressing Misinformation in Multilingual LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the propagation of harmful information in multilingual large language models (LLMs) and evaluates the efficacy of various unlearning methods. We demonstrate that fake information, regardless of the language it is in, once introduced into these models through training data, can spread across different languages, compromising the integrity and reliability of the generated content. Our findings reveal that standard unlearning techniques, which typically focus on English data, are insufficient in mitigating the spread of harmful content in multilingual contexts and could inadvertently reinforce harmful content across languages. We show that only by addressing harmful responses in both English and the original language of the harmful data can we effectively eliminate generations for all languages. This underscores the critical need for comprehensive unlearning strategies that consider the multilingual nature of modern LLMs to enhance their safety and reliability across diverse linguistic landscapes.</description>

      <title>SampleAttention: Near-Lossless Acceleration of Long Context LLM Inference with Adaptive Structured Sparse Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15486v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now support extremely long context windows, but the quadratic complexity of vanilla attention results in significantly long Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) latency. Existing approaches to address this complexity require additional pretraining or finetuning, and often sacrifice model accuracy. In this paper, we first provide both theoretical and empirical foundations for near-lossless sparse attention. We find dynamically capturing head-specific sparse patterns at runtime with low overhead is crucial. To address this, we propose SampleAttention, an adaptive structured and near-lossless sparse attention. Leveraging observed significant sparse patterns, SampleAttention attends to a fixed percentage of adjacent tokens to capture local window patterns, and employs a two-stage query-guided key-value filtering approach, which adaptively select a minimum set of key-values with low overhead, to capture column stripe patterns. Comprehensive evaluations show that SampleAttention can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with nearly no accuracy loss, and reduces TTFT by up to $2.42\times$ compared with FlashAttention.</description>

      <title>Banishing LLM Hallucinations Requires Rethinking Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their powerful chat, coding, and reasoning abilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate. Conventional wisdom suggests that hallucinations are a consequence of a balance between creativity and factuality, which can be mitigated, but not eliminated, by grounding the LLM in external knowledge sources. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show that these traditional approaches fail to explain why LLMs hallucinate in practice. Specifically, we show that LLMs augmented with a massive Mixture of Memory Experts (MoME) can easily memorize large datasets of random numbers. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple neural networks trained to predict the next token hallucinate when the training loss is above a threshold as it usually does in practice when training on internet scale data. We interpret our findings by comparing against traditional retrieval methods for mitigating hallucinations. We use our findings to design a first generation model for removing hallucinations -- Lamini-1 -- that stores facts in a massive mixture of millions of memory experts that are retrieved dynamically.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Natural Language Inference Performance with Knowledge Graph for COVID-19 Automated Fact-Checking in Indonesian Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00061v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated fact-checking is a key strategy to overcome the spread of COVID-19 misinformation on the internet. These systems typically leverage deep learning approaches through Natural Language Inference (NLI) to verify the truthfulness of information based on supporting evidence. However, one challenge that arises in deep learning is performance stagnation due to a lack of knowledge during training. This study proposes using a Knowledge Graph (KG) as external knowledge to enhance NLI performance for automated COVID-19 fact-checking in the Indonesian language. The proposed model architecture comprises three modules: a fact module, an NLI module, and a classifier module. The fact module processes information from the KG, while the NLI module handles semantic relationships between the given premise and hypothesis. The representation vectors from both modules are concatenated and fed into the classifier module to produce the final result. The model was trained using the generated Indonesian COVID-19 fact-checking dataset and the COVID-19 KG Bahasa Indonesia. Our study demonstrates that incorporating KGs can significantly improve NLI performance in fact-checking, achieving the best accuracy of 0.8616. This suggests that KGs are a valuable component for enhancing NLI performance in automated fact-checking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16033v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inference-time alignment enhances the performance of large language models without requiring additional training or fine-tuning but presents challenges due to balancing computational efficiency with high-quality output. Best-of-N (BoN) sampling, as a simple yet powerful approach, generates multiple responses and selects the best one, achieving improved performance but with a high computational cost. We propose TreeBoN, a novel framework that integrates a speculative tree-search strategy into Best-of-N (BoN) Sampling. TreeBoN maintains a set of parent nodes, iteratively branching and pruning low-quality responses, thereby reducing computational overhead while maintaining high output quality. Our approach also leverages token-level rewards from Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to guide tree expansion and prune low-quality paths. We evaluate TreeBoN using AlpacaFarm, HH-RLHF, UltraFeedback, GSM8K, and TutorEval datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements. Specifically, TreeBoN achieves the highest win rate of 65% on TutorEval and around 60% win rates across other different datasets, outperforming standard BoN with the same computational cost and showcasing its scalability and alignment efficacy.</description>

      <title>Attacking Misinformation Detection Using Adversarial Examples Generated by Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models have many beneficial applications, but can they also be used to attack content-filtering algorithms in social media platforms? We investigate the challenge of generating adversarial examples to test the robustness of text classification algorithms detecting low-credibility content, including propaganda, false claims, rumours and hyperpartisan news. We focus on simulation of content moderation by setting realistic limits on the number of queries an attacker is allowed to attempt. Within our solution (TREPAT), initial rephrasings are generated by large language models with prompts inspired by meaning-preserving NLP tasks, such as text simplification and style transfer. Subsequently, these modifications are decomposed into small changes, applied through beam search procedure, until the victim classifier changes its decision. We perform (1) quantitative evaluation using various prompts, models and query limits, (2) targeted manual assessment of the generated text and (3) qualitative linguistic analysis. The results confirm the superiority of our approach in the constrained scenario, especially in case of long input text (news articles), where exhaustive search is not feasible.</description>

      <title>Dial-In LLM: Human-Aligned LLM-in-the-loop Intent Clustering for Customer Service Dialogues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09049v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discovering customer intentions is crucial for automated service agents, yet existing intent clustering methods often fall short due to their reliance on embedding distance metrics and neglect of underlying semantic structures. To address these limitations, we propose an LLM-in-the-loop (LLM-ITL) intent clustering framework, integrating the language understanding capabilities of LLMs into conventional clustering algorithms. Specifically, this paper (1) examines the effectiveness of fine-tuned LLMs in semantic coherence evaluation and intent cluster naming, achieving over 95% accuracy aligned with human judgments; (2) designs an LLM-ITL framework that facilitates the iterative discovery of coherent intent clusters and the optimal number of clusters; and (3) introduces context-aware techniques tailored for customer service dialogue. Since existing English benchmarks lack sufficient semantic diversity and intent coverage, we further present a comprehensive Chinese dialogue intent dataset comprising over 100k real customer service calls with 1,507 human-annotated clusters. The proposed approaches significantly outperform LLM-guided baselines, achieving notable improvements in clustering quality, cost efficiency, and downstream applications. Combined with several best practices, our findings highlight the prominence of LLM-in-the-loop techniques for scalable dialogue data mining.</description>

Abstract: Hallucination has emerged as a significant barrier to the effective application of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a novel Attention-Guided SElf-Reflection (AGSER) approach for zero-shot hallucination detection in LLMs. The AGSER method utilizes attention contributions to categorize the input query into attentive and non-attentive queries. Each query is then processed separately through the LLMs, allowing us to compute consistency scores between the generated responses and the original answer. The difference between the two consistency scores serves as a hallucination estimator. In addition to its efficacy in detecting hallucinations, AGSER notably reduces computational overhead, requiring only three passes through the LLM and utilizing two sets of tokens. We have conducted extensive experiments with four widely-used LLMs across three different hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in zero-shot hallucination detection.</description>

      <title>FedP$^2$EFT: Federated Learning to Personalize PEFT for Multilingual LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has enabled the training of multilingual large language models (LLMs) on diverse and decentralized multilingual data, especially on low-resource languages. To improve client-specific performance, personalization via the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules such as LoRA is common. This involves a personalization strategy (PS), such as the design of the PEFT adapter structures (e.g., in which layers to add LoRAs and what ranks) and choice of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates) for fine-tuning. Instead of manual PS configuration, we propose FedP$^2$EFT, a federated learning-to-personalize method for multilingual LLMs in cross-device FL settings. Unlike most existing PEFT structure selection methods, which are prone to overfitting low-data regimes, FedP$^2$EFT collaboratively learns the optimal personalized PEFT structure for each client via Bayesian sparse rank selection. Evaluations on both simulated and real-world multilingual FL benchmarks demonstrate that FedP$^2$EFT largely outperforms existing personalized fine-tuning methods, while complementing other existing FL methods.

      <title>FELLE: Autoregressive Speech Synthesis with Token-Wise Coarse-to-Fine Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To advance continuous-valued token modeling and temporal-coherence enforcement, we propose FELLE, an autoregressive model that integrates language modeling with token-wise flow matching. By leveraging the autoregressive nature of language models and the generative efficacy of flow matching, FELLE effectively predicts continuous-valued tokens (mel-spectrograms). For each continuous-valued token, FELLE modifies the general prior distribution in flow matching by incorporating information from the previous step, improving coherence and stability. Furthermore, to enhance synthesis quality, FELLE introduces a coarse-to-fine flow-matching mechanism, generating continuous-valued tokens hierarchically, conditioned on the language model's output. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of incorporating flow-matching techniques in autoregressive mel-spectrogram modeling, leading to significant improvements in TTS generation quality, as shown in https://aka.ms/felle.</description>

      <title>Rapid Word Learning Through Meta In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans can quickly learn a new word from a few illustrative examples, and then systematically and flexibly use it in novel contexts. Yet the abilities of current language models for few-shot word learning, and methods for improving these abilities, are underexplored. In this study, we introduce a novel method, Meta-training for IN-context learNing Of Words (Minnow). This method trains language models to generate new examples of a word's usage given a few in-context examples, using a special placeholder token to represent the new word. This training is repeated on many new words to develop a general word-learning ability. We find that training models from scratch with Minnow on human-scale child-directed language enables strong few-shot word learning, comparable to a large language model (LLM) pre-trained on orders of magnitude more data. Furthermore, through discriminative and generative evaluations, we demonstrate that finetuning pre-trained LLMs with Minnow improves their ability to discriminate between new words, identify syntactic categories of new words, and generate reasonable new usages and definitions for new words, based on one or a few in-context examples. These findings highlight the data efficiency of Minnow and its potential to improve language model performance in word learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Problem Solved? Information Extraction Design Space for Layout-Rich Documents using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper defines and explores the design space for information extraction (IE) from layout-rich documents using large language models (LLMs). The three core challenges of layout-aware IE with LLMs are 1) data structuring, 2) model engagement, and 3) output refinement. Our study investigates the sub-problems and methods within these core challenges, such as input representation, chunking, prompting, selection of LLMs, and multimodal models. It examines the effect of different design choices through LayIE-LLM, a new, open-source, layout-aware IE test suite, benchmarking against traditional, fine-tuned IE models. The results on two IE datasets show that LLMs require adjustment of the IE pipeline to achieve competitive performance: the optimized configuration found with LayIE-LLM achieves 13.3--37.5 F1 points more than a general-practice baseline configuration using the same LLM. To find a well-working configuration, we develop a one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method that achieves near-optimal results. Our method is only 0.8--1.8 points lower than the best full factorial exploration with a fraction (2.8%) of the required computation. Overall, we demonstrate that, if well-configured, general-purpose LLMs match the performance of specialized models, providing a cost-effective, finetuning-free alternative. Our test-suite is available at https://github.com/gayecolakoglu/LayIE-LLM.</description>

      <title>Texture or Semantics? Vision-Language Models Get Lost in Font Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable visual and linguistic capabilities, achieving impressive performance in various tasks such as image recognition and object localization. However, their effectiveness in fine-grained tasks remains an open question. In everyday scenarios, individuals encountering design materials, such as magazines, typography tutorials, research papers, or branding content, may wish to identify aesthetically pleasing fonts used in the text. Given their multimodal capabilities and free accessibility, many VLMs are often considered potential tools for font recognition. This raises a fundamental question: Do VLMs truly possess the capability to recognize fonts? To investigate this, we introduce the Font Recognition Benchmark (FRB), a compact and well-structured dataset comprising 15 commonly used fonts. FRB includes two versions: (i) an easy version, where 10 sentences are rendered in different fonts, and (ii) a hard version, where each text sample consists of the names of the 15 fonts themselves, introducing a stroop effect that challenges model perception. Through extensive evaluation of various VLMs on font recognition tasks, we arrive at the following key findings: (i) Current VLMs exhibit limited font recognition capabilities, with many state-of-the-art models failing to achieve satisfactory performance and being easily affected by the stroop effect introduced by textual information. (ii) Few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting provide minimal benefits in improving font recognition accuracy across different VLMs. (iii) Attention analysis sheds light on the inherent limitations of VLMs in capturing semantic features.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire general linguistic knowledge from massive-scale pretraining. However, pretraining data mainly comprised of web-crawled texts contain undesirable social biases which can be perpetuated or even amplified by LLMs. In this study, we propose an efficient yet effective annotation pipeline to investigate social biases in the pretraining corpora. Our pipeline consists of protected attribute detection to identify diverse demographics, followed by regard classification to analyze the language polarity towards each attribute. Through our experiments, we demonstrate the effect of our bias analysis and mitigation measures, focusing on Common Crawl as the most representative pretraining corpus.</description>

      <title>LawFlow: Collecting and Simulating Lawyers' Thought Processes on Business Formation Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Legal practitioners, particularly those early in their careers, face complex, high-stakes tasks that require adaptive, context-sensitive reasoning. While AI holds promise in supporting legal work, current datasets and models are narrowly focused on isolated subtasks and fail to capture the end-to-end decision-making required in real-world practice. To address this gap, we introduce LawFlow, a dataset of complete end-to-end legal workflows collected from trained law students, grounded in real-world business entity formation scenarios. Unlike prior datasets focused on input-output pairs or linear chains of thought, LawFlow captures dynamic, modular, and iterative reasoning processes that reflect the ambiguity, revision, and client-adaptive strategies of legal practice. Using LawFlow, we compare human and LLM-generated workflows, revealing systematic differences in structure, reasoning flexibility, and plan execution. Human workflows tend to be modular and adaptive, while LLM workflows are more sequential, exhaustive, and less sensitive to downstream implications. Our findings also suggest that legal professionals prefer AI to carry out supportive roles, such as brainstorming, identifying blind spots, and surfacing alternatives, rather than executing complex workflows end-to-end. Our results highlight both the current limitations of LLMs in supporting complex legal workflows and opportunities for developing more collaborative, reasoning-aware legal AI systems.

      <description>arXiv:2505.02273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) are not robust to out-of-distribution inputs. Machine generated (``optimized'') prompts can be used to modulate LM outputs and induce specific behaviors while appearing completely uninterpretable. In this work, we investigate the composition of optimized prompts, as well as the mechanisms by which LMs parse and build predictions from optimized prompts. We find that optimized prompts primarily consist of punctuation and noun tokens which are more rare in the training data. Internally, optimized prompts are clearly distinguishable from natural language counterparts based on sparse subsets of the model's activations. Across various families of instruction-tuned models, optimized prompts follow a similar path in how their representations form through the network.</description>

      <title>QualBench: Benchmarking Chinese LLMs with Localized Professional Qualifications for Vertical Domain Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Chinese LLMs underscores the need for vertical-domain evaluations to ensure reliable applications. However, existing benchmarks often lack domain coverage and provide limited insights into the Chinese working context. Leveraging qualification exams as a unified framework for expertise evaluation, we introduce QualBench, the first multi-domain Chinese QA benchmark dedicated to localized assessment of Chinese LLMs. The dataset includes over 17,000 questions across six vertical domains, drawn from 24 Chinese qualifications to align with national policies and professional standards. Results reveal an interesting pattern of Chinese LLMs consistently surpassing non-Chinese models, with the Qwen2.5 model outperforming the more advanced GPT-4o, emphasizing the value of localized domain knowledge in meeting qualification requirements. The average accuracy of 53.98% reveals the current gaps in domain coverage within model capabilities. Furthermore, we identify performance degradation caused by LLM crowdsourcing, assess data contamination, and illustrate the effectiveness of prompt engineering and model fine-tuning, suggesting opportunities for future improvements through multi-domain RAG and Federated Learning.</description>

      <title>Insertion Language Models: Sequence Generation with Arbitrary-Position Insertions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs), which predict subsequent tokens one-by-one ``from left to right,'' have achieved significant success across a wide range of sequence generation tasks. However, they struggle to accurately represent sequences that require satisfying sophisticated constraints or whose sequential dependencies are better addressed by out-of-order generation. Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) address some of these limitations, but the process of unmasking multiple tokens simultaneously in MDMs can introduce incoherences, and MDMs cannot handle arbitrary infilling constraints when the number of tokens to be filled in is not known in advance. In this work, we introduce Insertion Language Models (ILMs), which learn to insert tokens at arbitrary positions in a sequence -- that is, they select jointly both the position and the vocabulary element to be inserted. By inserting tokens one at a time, ILMs can represent strong dependencies between tokens, and their ability to generate sequences in arbitrary order allows them to accurately model sequences where token dependencies do not follow a left-to-right sequential structure. To train ILMs, we propose a tailored network parameterization and use a simple denoising objective. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that ILMs outperform both ARMs and MDMs on common planning tasks. Furthermore, we show that ILMs outperform MDMs and perform on par with ARMs in an unconditional text generation task while offering greater flexibility than MDMs in arbitrary-length text infilling.

      <title>NOVER: Incentive Training for Language Models via Verifier-Free Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances such as DeepSeek R1-Zero highlight the effectiveness of incentive training, a reinforcement learning paradigm that computes rewards solely based on the final answer part of a language model's output, thereby encouraging the generation of intermediate reasoning steps. However, these methods fundamentally rely on external verifiers, which limits their applicability to domains like mathematics and coding where such verifiers are readily available. Although reward models can serve as verifiers, they require high-quality annotated data and are costly to train. In this work, we propose NOVER, NO-VERifier Reinforcement Learning, a general reinforcement learning framework that requires only standard supervised fine-tuning data with no need for an external verifier. NOVER enables incentive training across a wide range of text-to-text tasks and outperforms the model of the same size distilled from large reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1 671B by 7.7 percent. Moreover, the flexibility of NOVER enables new possibilities for optimizing large language models, such as inverse incentive training.</description>

      <title>Unveil Multi-Picture Descriptions for Multilingual Mild Cognitive Impairment Detection via Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17067v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment from picture descriptions is critical yet challenging, especially in multilingual and multiple picture settings. Prior work has primarily focused on English speakers describing a single picture (e.g., the 'Cookie Theft'). The TAUKDIAL-2024 challenge expands this scope by introducing multilingual speakers and multiple pictures, which presents new challenges in analyzing picture-dependent content. To address these challenges, we propose a framework with three components: (1) enhancing discriminative representation learning via supervised contrastive learning, (2) involving image modality rather than relying solely on speech and text modalities, and (3) applying a Product of Experts (PoE) strategy to mitigate spurious correlations and overfitting. Our framework improves MCI detection performance, achieving a +7.1% increase in Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) (from 68.1% to 75.2%) and a +2.9% increase in F1 score (from 80.6% to 83.5%) compared to the text unimodal baseline. Notably, the contrastive learning component yields greater gains for the text modality compared to speech. These results highlight our framework's effectiveness in multilingual and multi-picture MCI detection.</description>

      <title>Cog-TiPRO: Iterative Prompt Refinement with LLMs to Detect Cognitive Decline via Longitudinal Voice Assistant Commands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17137v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early detection of cognitive decline is crucial for enabling interventions that can slow neurodegenerative disease progression. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on labor-intensive clinical assessments, which are impractical for frequent monitoring. Our pilot study investigates voice assistant systems (VAS) as non-invasive tools for detecting cognitive decline through longitudinal analysis of speech patterns in voice commands. Over an 18-month period, we collected voice commands from 35 older adults, with 15 participants providing daily at-home VAS interactions. To address the challenges of analyzing these short, unstructured and noisy commands, we propose Cog-TiPRO, a framework that combines (1) LLM-driven iterative prompt refinement for linguistic feature extraction, (2) HuBERT-based acoustic feature extraction, and (3) transformer-based temporal modeling. Using iTransformer, our approach achieves 73.80% accuracy and 72.67% F1-score in detecting MCI, outperforming its baseline by 27.13%. Through our LLM approach, we identify linguistic features that uniquely characterize everyday command usage patterns in individuals experiencing cognitive decline.</description>

      <title>On the class of coding optimality of human languages and the origins of Zipf's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20015v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we present a new class of optimality for coding systems. Members of that class are displaced linearly from optimal coding and thus exhibit Zipf's law, namely a power-law distribution of frequency ranks. Within that class, Zipf's law, the size-rank law and the size-probability law form a group-like structure. We identify human languages that are members of the class. All languages showing sufficient agreement with Zipf's law are potential members of the class. In contrast, there are communication systems in other species that cannot be members of that class for exhibiting an exponential distribution instead but dolphins and humpback whales might. We provide a new insight into plots of frequency versus rank in double logarithmic scale. For any system, a straight line in that scale indicates that the lengths of optimal codes under non-singular coding and under uniquely decodable encoding are displaced by a linear function whose slope is the exponent of Zipf's law. For systems under compression and constrained to be uniquely decodable, such a straight line may indicate that the system is coding close to optimality. We provide support for the hypothesis that Zipf's law originates from compression and define testable conditions for the emergence of Zipf's law in compressing systems.</description>

      <title>IndexTTS2: A Breakthrough in Emotionally Expressive and Duration-Controlled Auto-Regressive Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing autoregressive large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models have advantages in speech naturalness, but their token-by-token generation mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of synthesized speech. This becomes a significant limitation in applications requiring strict audio-visual synchronization, such as video dubbing. This paper introduces IndexTTS2, which proposes a novel, general, and autoregressive model-friendly method for speech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one explicitly specifies the number of generated tokens to precisely control speech duration; the other freely generates speech in an autoregressive manner without specifying the number of tokens, while faithfully reproducing the prosodic features of the input prompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional expression and speaker identity, enabling independent control over timbre and emotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can accurately reconstruct the target timbre (from the timbre prompt) while perfectly reproducing the specified emotional tone (from the style prompt). To enhance speech clarity in highly emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent representations and design a novel three-stage training paradigm to improve the stability of the generated speech. Additionally, to lower the barrier for emotional control, we designed a soft instruction mechanism based on text descriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3, effectively guiding the generation of speech with the desired emotional orientation. Finally, experimental results on multiple datasets show that IndexTTS2 outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in terms of word error rate, speaker similarity, and emotional fidelity.

      <title>RAT: Bridging RNN Efficiency and Attention Accuracy via Chunk-based Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers have become the cornerstone of modern large-scale language models, but their reliance on softmax attention poses a computational bottleneck at both training and inference. Recurrent models offer high efficiency, but compressing the full sequence into a fixed-size and holistic representation suffers from memory degradation in long contexts and limits fine-grained retrieval. To address this, we propose RAT, an intermediate design that bridges the efficiency of RNNs and capacity of attention. RAT partitions the input into chunks, applies recurrence within each chunk for local dependencies, and softmax-based attention across chunks for long-range interactions. This design mitigates memory degradation and enables direct access to distant tokens, while retaining computational efficiency. Empirically, with a chunk size of 16, the RAT block achieves a 7x improvement in training speed with 100K token sequences and 9x in generation at the 4K position, while maintaining similar performance compared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter models from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short- and long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We further propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves RAT with local attention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local interactions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces cache memory usage, but also consistently enhances performance and shows the overall best results.

      <title>Advancing Dialectal Arabic to Modern Standard Arabic Machine Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dialectal Arabic (DA) poses a persistent challenge for natural language processing (NLP), as most everyday communication in the Arab world occurs in dialects that diverge significantly from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This linguistic divide impedes progress in Arabic machine translation. This paper presents two core contributions to advancing DA-MSA translation for the Levantine, Egyptian, and Gulf dialects, particularly in low-resource and computationally constrained settings: (i) a comprehensive evaluation of training-free prompting techniques, and (ii) the development of a resource-efficient fine-tuning pipeline. Our evaluation of prompting strategies across six large language models (LLMs) found that few-shot prompting consistently outperformed zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and our proposed Ara-TEaR method. Ara-TEaR is designed as a three-stage self-refinement prompting process, targeting frequent meaning-transfer and adaptation errors in DA-MSA translation. In this evaluation, GPT-4o achieved the highest performance across all prompting settings. For fine-tuning LLMs, a quantized Gemma2-9B model achieved a chrF++ score of 49.88, outperforming zero-shot GPT-4o (44.58). Joint multi-dialect trained models outperformed single-dialect counterparts by over 10% chrF++, and 4-bit quantization reduced memory usage by 60% with less than 1% performance loss. The results and insights of our experiments offer a practical blueprint for improving dialectal inclusion in Arabic NLP, showing that high-quality DA-MSA machine translation is achievable even with limited resources and paving the way for more inclusive language technologies.</description>

      <title>MoNaCo: More Natural and Complex Questions for Reasoning Across Dozens of Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated agents, powered by Large language models (LLMs), are emerging as the go-to tool for querying information. However, evaluation benchmarks for LLM agents rarely feature natural questions that are both information-seeking and genuinely time-consuming for humans. To address this gap we introduce MoNaCo, a benchmark of 1,315 natural and time-consuming questions that require dozens, and at times hundreds, of intermediate steps to solve -- far more than any existing QA benchmark. To build MoNaCo, we developed a decomposed annotation pipeline to elicit and manually answer real-world time-consuming questions at scale. Frontier LLMs evaluated on MoNaCo achieve at most 61.2% F1, hampered by low recall and hallucinations. Our results underscore the limitations of LLM-powered agents in handling the complexity and sheer breadth of real-world information-seeking tasks -- with MoNaCo providing an effective resource for tracking such progress. The MoNaCo benchmark, codebase, prompts and models predictions are all publicly available at: https://tomerwolgithub.github.io/monaco</description>

      <title>Memory-R1: Enhancing Large Language Model Agents to Manage and Utilize Memories via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of NLP tasks, but they remain fundamentally stateless, constrained by limited context windows that hinder long-horizon reasoning. Recent efforts to address this limitation often augment LLMs with an external memory bank, yet most existing pipelines are static and heuristic-driven, lacking any learned mechanism for deciding what to store, update, or retrieve. We present Memory-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that equips LLMs with the ability to actively manage and utilize external memory through two specialized agents: a Memory Manager that learns to perform structured memory operations, including adding, updating, deleting, or taking no operation on memory entries; and an Answer Agent that selects the most relevant entries and reasons over them to produce an answer. Both agents are fine-tuned with outcome-driven RL (PPO and GRPO), enabling adaptive memory management and utilization with minimal supervision. With as few as 152 question-answer pairs and a corresponding temporal memory bank for training, Memory-R1 outperforms the strongest existing baseline and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse question types and LLM backbones. Beyond presenting an effective approach, this work provides insights into how RL can unlock more agentic, memory-aware behavior in LLMs, pointing toward richer, more persistent reasoning systems.</description>

      <title>GUARD: Glocal Uncertainty-Aware Robust Decoding for Effective and Efficient Open-Ended Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/YecanLee/GUARD.</description>

      <title>Probe-Rewrite-Evaluate: A Workflow for Reliable Benchmarks and Quantifying Evaluation Awareness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit significant behavioral shifts when they perceive a change from a real-world deployment context to a controlled evaluation setting, a phenomenon known as "evaluation awareness." This discrepancy poses a critical challenge for AI alignment, as benchmark performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty. In this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from "test-like" to "deploy-like" and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%, indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model alignment before deployment.</description>

      <title>Avoidance Decoding for Diverse Multi-Branch Story Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate repetitive and monotonous outputs, especially in tasks like story generation, due to limited creative diversity when given the same input prompt. To address this challenge, we propose a novel decoding strategy, Avoidance Decoding, that modifies token logits by penalizing similarity to previously generated outputs, thereby encouraging more diverse multi-branch stories. This penalty adaptively balances two similarity measures: (1) Concept-level Similarity Penalty, which is prioritized in early stages to diversify initial story concepts, and (2) Narrative-level Similarity Penalty, which is increasingly emphasized later to ensure natural yet diverse plot development. Notably, our method achieves up to 2.6 times higher output diversity and reduces repetition by an average of 30% compared to strong baselines, while effectively mitigating text degeneration. Furthermore, we reveal that our method activates a broader range of neurons, demonstrating that it leverages the model's intrinsic creativity.</description>

      <title>MoSEs: Uncertainty-Aware AI-Generated Text Detection via Mixture of Stylistics Experts with Conditional Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has intensified public concerns about the potential misuse. Therefore, it is important to build trustworthy AI-generated text detection systems. Existing methods neglect stylistic modeling and mostly rely on static thresholds, which greatly limits the detection performance. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Stylistic Experts (MoSEs) framework that enables stylistics-aware uncertainty quantification through conditional threshold estimation. MoSEs contain three core components, namely, the Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), the Stylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and the Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE). For input text, SRR can activate the appropriate reference data in SRR and provide them to CTE. Subsequently, CTE jointly models the linguistic statistical properties and semantic features to dynamically determine the optimal threshold. With a discrimination score, MoSEs yields prediction labels with the corresponding confidence level. Our framework achieves an average improvement 11.34% in detection performance compared to baselines. More inspiringly, MoSEs shows a more evident improvement 39.15% in the low-resource case. Our code is available at https://github.com/creator-xi/MoSEs.</description>

      <title>JARVIS: A Neuro-Symbolic Commonsense Reasoning Framework for Conversational Embodied Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13266v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building a conversational embodied agent to execute real-life tasks has been a long-standing yet quite challenging research goal, as it requires effective human-agent communication, multi-modal understanding, long-range sequential decision making, etc. Traditional symbolic methods have scaling and generalization issues, while end-to-end deep learning models suffer from data scarcity and high task complexity, and are often hard to explain. To benefit from both worlds, we propose JARVIS, a neuro-symbolic commonsense reasoning framework for modular, generalizable, and interpretable conversational embodied agents. First, it acquires symbolic representations by prompting large language models (LLMs) for language understanding and sub-goal planning, and by constructing semantic maps from visual observations. Then the symbolic module reasons for sub-goal planning and action generation based on task- and action-level common sense. Extensive experiments on the TEACh dataset validate the efficacy and efficiency of our JARVIS framework, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on all three dialog-based embodied tasks, including Execution from Dialog History (EDH), Trajectory from Dialog (TfD), and Two-Agent Task Completion (TATC) (e.g., our method boosts the unseen Success Rate on EDH from 6.1\% to 15.8\%). Moreover, we systematically analyze the essential factors that affect the task performance and also demonstrate the superiority of our method in few-shot settings. Our JARVIS model ranks first in the Alexa Prize SimBot Public Benchmark Challenge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) continue to expand rapidly, Human-AI (HAI) Collaboration, combining human intellect and AI systems, has become pivotal for advancing problem-solving and decision-making processes. The advent of Large Foundation Models (LFMs) has greatly expanded its potential, offering unprecedented capabilities by leveraging vast amounts of data to understand and predict complex patterns. At the same time, realizing this potential responsibly requires addressing persistent challenges related to safety, fairness, and control. This paper reviews the crucial integration of LFMs with HAI, highlighting both opportunities and risks. We structure our analysis around four areas: human-guided model development, collaborative design principles, ethical and governance frameworks, and applications in high-stakes domains. Our review shows that successful HAI systems are not the automatic result of stronger models but the product of careful, human-centered design. By identifying key open challenges, this survey aims to give insight into current and future research that turns the raw power of LFMs into partnerships that are reliable, trustworthy, and beneficial to society.</description>

      <title>Exploring Response Uncertainty in MLLMs: An Empirical Evaluation under Misleading Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on tasks ranging from visual question answering to video understanding. However, existing studies have concentrated mainly on visual-textual misalignment, leaving largely unexplored the MLLMs' ability to preserve an originally correct answer when confronted with misleading information. We reveal a response uncertainty phenomenon: across nine standard datasets, twelve state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs overturn a previously correct answer in 65% of cases after receiving a single deceptive cue. To systematically quantify this vulnerability, we propose a two-stage evaluation pipeline: (1) elicit each model's original response on unperturbed inputs; (2) inject explicit (false-answer hints) and implicit (contextual contradictions) misleading instructions, and compute the misleading rate - the fraction of correct-to-incorrect flips. Leveraging the most susceptible examples, we curate the Multimodal Uncertainty Benchmark (MUB), a collection of image-question pairs stratified into low, medium, and high difficulty based on how many of twelve state-of-the-art MLLMs they mislead. Extensive evaluation on twelve open-source and five closed-source models reveals a high uncertainty: average misleading rates exceed 86%, with explicit cues over 67.19% and implicit cues over 80.67%. To reduce the misleading rate, we then fine-tune all open-source MLLMs on a compact 2000-sample mixed-instruction dataset, reducing misleading rates to 6.97% (explicit) and 32.77% (implicit), boosting consistency by nearly 29.37% on highly deceptive inputs, and slightly improving accuracy on standard benchmarks.

      <title>PadChest-GR: A Bilingual Chest X-ray Dataset for Grounded Radiology Report Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to create free-text radiology reports from clinical imaging. Grounded radiology report generation (GRRG) extends RRG by including the localisation of individual findings on the image. Currently, there are no manually annotated chest X-ray (CXR) datasets to train GRRG models. In this work, we present a dataset called PadChest-GR (Grounded-Reporting) derived from PadChest aimed at training GRRG models for CXR images. We curate a public bi-lingual dataset of 4,555 CXR studies with grounded reports (3,099 abnormal and 1,456 normal), each containing complete lists of sentences describing individual present (positive) and absent (negative) findings in English and Spanish. In total, PadChest-GR contains 7,037 positive and 3,422 negative finding sentences. Every positive finding sentence is associated with up to two independent sets of bounding boxes labelled by different readers and has categorical labels for finding type, locations, and progression. To the best of our knowledge, PadChest-GR is the first manually curated dataset designed to train GRRG models for understanding and interpreting radiological images and generated text. By including detailed localization and comprehensive annotations of all clinically relevant findings, it provides a valuable resource for developing and evaluating GRRG models from CXR images.

      <title>That is Unacceptable: the Moral Foundations of Canceling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Canceling is a morally-driven phenomenon that hinders the development of safe social media platforms and contributes to ideological polarization. To address this issue we present the Canceling Attitudes Detection (CADE) dataset, an annotated corpus of canceling incidents aimed at exploring the factors of disagreements in evaluating people canceling attitudes on social media. Specifically, we study the impact of annotators' morality in their perception of canceling, showing that morality is an independent axis for the explanation of disagreement on this phenomenon. Annotator's judgments heavily depend on the type of controversial events and involved celebrities. This shows the need to develop more event-centric datasets to better understand how harms are perpetrated in social media and to develop more aware technologies for their detection.</description>

      <title>You Sound a Little Tense: L2 Tailored Clear TTS Using Durational Vowel Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first text-to-speech (TTS) system tailored to second language (L2) speakers. We use duration differences between American English tense (longer) and lax (shorter) vowels to create a "clarity mode" for Matcha-TTS. Our perception studies showed that French-L1, English-L2 listeners had fewer (at least 9.15%) transcription errors when using our clarity mode, and found it more encouraging and respectful than overall slowed down speech. Remarkably, listeners were not aware of these effects: despite the decreased word error rate in clarity mode, listeners still believed that slowing all target words was the most intelligible, suggesting that actual intelligibility does not correlate with perceived intelligibility. Additionally, we found that Whisper-ASR did not use the same cues as L2 speakers to differentiate difficult vowels and is not sufficient to assess the intelligibility of TTS systems for these individuals.</description>

      <title>CoT-Self-Instruct: Building high-quality synthetic prompts for reasoning and non-reasoning tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose CoT-Self-Instruct, a synthetic data generation method that instructs LLMs to first reason and plan via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on given seed tasks, and then generate a new synthetic example of similar quality and complexity. This is followed by a filtering step to select high-quality data using automatic metrics, which are then used for LLM training. In verifiable reasoning, our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as s1k and OpenMathReasoning, when evaluated on MATH500, AMC23, AIME24, and GPQA-Diamond. For non-verifiable instruction-following tasks, our method surpasses the performance of both human and standard Self-Instruct training data on the AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>The Ramon Llull's Thinking Machine for Automated Ideation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g., efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work - motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward collaborative ideation between humans and AI.</description>

      <title>AHELM: A Holistic Evaluation of Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety. Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety. We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM, with one ranking 6th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities. For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added over time.</description>

      <title>Pruning Weights but Not Truth: Safeguarding Truthfulness While Pruning LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network pruning has emerged as a promising approach for deploying LLMs in low-resource scenarios while preserving downstream task performance. However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs' internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection. Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for better calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach improves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at 50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA.</description>

      <title>L-MARS: Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and Agentic Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval. Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources (Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal retrieval and deliberation.</description>

      <title>ChatCLIDS: Simulating Persuasive AI Dialogues to Promote Closed-Loop Insulin Adoption in Type 1 Diabetes Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1 diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies. ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under realistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of current LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.</description>
