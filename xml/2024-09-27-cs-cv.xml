      <title>Explaining Human Comparisons using Alignment-Importance Heatmaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational explainability approach for human comparison tasks, using Alignment Importance Score (AIS) heatmaps derived from deep-vision models. The AIS reflects a feature-map's unique contribution to the alignment between Deep Neural Network's (DNN) representational geometry and that of humans. We first validate the AIS by showing that prediction of out-of-sample human similarity judgments is improved when constructing representations using only higher-scoring AIS feature maps identified from a training set. We then compute image-specific heatmaps that visually indicate the areas that correspond to feature-maps with higher AIS scores. These maps provide an intuitive explanation of which image areas are more important when it is compared to other images in a cohort. We observe a correspondence between these heatmaps and saliency maps produced by a gaze-prediction model. However, in some cases, meaningful differences emerge, as the dimensions relevant for comparison are not necessarily the most visually salient. To conclude, Alignment Importance improves prediction of human similarity judgments from DNN embeddings, and provides interpretable insights into the relevant information in image space.</description>

      <title>GenCAD: Image-Conditioned Computer-Aided Design Generation with Transformer-Based Contrastive Representation and Diffusion Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The creation of manufacturable and editable 3D shapes through Computer-Aided Design (CAD) remains a highly manual and time-consuming task, hampered by the complex topology of boundary representations of 3D solids and unintuitive design tools. This paper introduces GenCAD, a generative model that employs autoregressive transformers and latent diffusion models to transform image inputs into parametric CAD command sequences, resulting in editable 3D shape representations. GenCAD integrates an autoregressive transformer-based architecture with a contrastive learning framework, enhancing the generation of CAD programs from input images and providing a representation learning framework for multiple data modalities relevant to engineering designs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GenCAD significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of the precision and modifiability of generated 3D shapes. Notably, GenCAD shows a marked improvement in the accuracy of 3D shape generation for long sequences, supporting its application in complex design tasks. Additionally, the contrastive embedding feature of GenCAD facilitates the retrieval of CAD models using image queries from databases which is a critical challenge within the CAD community. While most work in the 3D shape generation literature focuses on representations like meshes, voxels, or point clouds, practical engineering applications demand modifiability and the ability for multi-modal conditional generation. Our results provide a significant step forward in this direction, highlighting the potential of generative models to expedite the entire design-to-production pipeline and seamlessly integrate different design modalities.</description>

      <title>LiDAR-3DGS: LiDAR Reinforced 3D Gaussian Splatting for Multimodal Radiance Field Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the capabilities of multimodal inputs to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based Radiance Field Rendering. We present LiDAR-3DGS, a novel method of reinforcing 3DGS inputs with LiDAR generated point clouds to significantly improve the accuracy and detail of 3D models. We demonstrate a systematic approach of LiDAR reinforcement to 3DGS to enable capturing of important features such as bolts, apertures, and other details that are often missed by image-based features alone. These details are crucial for engineering applications such as remote monitoring and maintenance. Without modifying the underlying 3DGS algorithm, we demonstrate that even a modest addition of LiDAR generated point cloud significantly enhances the perceptual quality of the models. At 30k iterations, the model generated by our method resulted in an increase of 7.064% in PSNR and 0.565% in SSIM, respectively. Since the LiDAR used in this research was a commonly used commercial-grade device, the improvements observed were modest and can be further enhanced with higher-grade LiDAR systems. Additionally, these improvements can be supplementary to other derivative works of Radiance Field Rendering and also provide a new insight for future LiDAR and computer vision integrated modeling.</description>

      <title>Development and Application of a Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery Dataset for Deep-Learning Driven Forest Wildfire Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forest loss due to natural events, such as wildfires, represents an increasing global challenge that demands advanced analytical methods for effective detection and mitigation. To this end, the integration of satellite imagery with deep learning (DL) methods has become essential. Nevertheless, this approach requires substantial amounts of labeled data to produce accurate results. In this study, we use bi-temporal Sentinel-2 satellite imagery sourced from Google Earth Engine (GEE) to build the California Wildfire GeoImaging Dataset (CWGID), a high-resolution labeled satellite imagery dataset with over 100,000 labeled before and after forest wildfire image pairs for wildfire detection through DL. Our methods include data acquisition from authoritative sources, data processing, and an initial dataset analysis using three pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. Our results show that the EF EfficientNet-B0 model achieves the highest accuracy of over 92% in detecting forest wildfires. The CWGID and the methodology used to build it, prove to be a valuable resource for training and testing DL architectures for forest wildfire detection.</description>

      <title>Instance Segmentation of Reinforced Concrete Bridges with Synthetic Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The National Bridge Inspection Standards require detailed element-level bridge inspections. Traditionally, inspectors manually assign condition ratings by rating structural components based on damage, but this process is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Automating the element-level bridge inspection process can facilitate more comprehensive condition documentation to improve overall bridge management. While semantic segmentation of bridge point clouds has been studied, research on instance segmentation of bridge elements is limited, partly due to the lack of annotated datasets, and the difficulty in generalizing trained models. To address this, we propose a novel approach for generating synthetic data using three distinct methods. Our framework leverages the Mask3D transformer model, optimized with hyperparameter tuning and a novel occlusion technique. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on real LiDAR and photogrammetry bridge point clouds, respectively, demonstrating the potential of the framework for automating element-level bridge inspections.</description>

      <title>Towards Synthetic Data Generation for Improved Pain Recognition in Videos under Patient Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognizing pain in video is crucial for improving patient-computer interaction systems, yet traditional data collection in this domain raises significant ethical and logistical challenges. This study introduces a novel approach that leverages synthetic data to enhance video-based pain recognition models, providing an ethical and scalable alternative. We present a pipeline that synthesizes realistic 3D facial models by capturing nuanced facial movements from a small participant pool, and mapping these onto diverse synthetic avatars. This process generates 8,600 synthetic faces, accurately reflecting genuine pain expressions from varied angles and perspectives.
  Utilizing advanced facial capture techniques, and leveraging public datasets like CelebV-HQ and FFHQ-UV for demographic diversity, our new synthetic dataset significantly enhances model training while ensuring privacy by anonymizing identities through facial replacements.
  Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on combinations of synthetic data paired with a small amount of real participants achieve superior performance in pain recognition, effectively bridging the gap between synthetic simulations and real-world applications. Our approach addresses data scarcity and ethical concerns, offering a new solution for pain detection and opening new avenues for research in privacy-preserving dataset generation. All resources are publicly available to encourage further innovation in this field.</description>

      <title>Camera Calibration and Stereo via a Single Image of a Spherical Mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel technique for camera calibration using a single view that incorporates a spherical mirror. Leveraging the distinct characteristics of the sphere's contour visible in the image and its reflections, we showcase the effectiveness of our method in achieving precise calibration. Furthermore, the reflection from the mirrored surface provides additional information about the surrounding scene beyond the image frame.
  Our method paves the way for the development of simple catadioptric stereo systems. We explore the challenges and opportunities associated with employing a single mirrored sphere, highlighting the potential applications of this setup in practical scenarios. The paper delves into the intricacies of the geometry and calibration procedures involved in catadioptric stereo utilizing a spherical mirror.
  Experimental results, encompassing both synthetic and real-world data, are presented to illustrate the feasibility and accuracy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Improving Intersession Reproducibility for Forearm Ultrasound based Hand Gesture Classification through an Incremental Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound images of the forearm can be used to classify hand gestures towards developing human machine interfaces. In our previous work, we have demonstrated gesture classification using ultrasound on a single subject without removing the probe before evaluation. This has limitations in usage as once the probe is removed and replaced, the accuracy declines since the classifier performance is sensitive to the probe location on the arm. In this paper, we propose training a model on multiple data collection sessions to create a generalized model, utilizing incremental learning through fine tuning. Ultrasound data was acquired for 5 hand gestures within a session (without removing and putting the probe back on) and across sessions. A convolutional neural network (CNN) with 5 cascaded convolution layers was used for this study. A pre-trained CNN was fine tuned with the convolution blocks acting as a feature extractor, and the parameters of the remaining layers updated in an incremental fashion. Fine tuning was done using different session splits within a session and between multiple sessions. We found that incremental fine tuning can help enhance classification accuracy with more fine tuning sessions. After 2 fine tuning sessions for each experiment, we found an approximate 10% increase in classification accuracy. This work demonstrates that incremental learning through fine tuning on ultrasound based hand gesture classification can be used improves accuracy while saving storage, processing power, and time. It can be expanded to generalize between multiple subjects and towards developing personalized wearable devices.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Local Structure for Improving Model Explanations: An Information Propagation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous explanation methods have been recently developed to interpret the decisions made by deep neural network (DNN) models. For image classifiers, these methods typically provide an attribution score to each pixel in the image to quantify its contribution to the prediction. However, most of these explanation methods appropriate attribution scores to pixels independently, even though both humans and DNNs make decisions by analyzing a set of closely related pixels simultaneously. Hence, the attribution score of a pixel should be evaluated jointly by considering itself and its structurally-similar pixels. We propose a method called IProp, which models each pixel's individual attribution score as a source of explanatory information and explains the image prediction through the dynamic propagation of information across all pixels. To formulate the information propagation, IProp adopts the Markov Reward Process, which guarantees convergence, and the final status indicates the desired pixels' attribution scores. Furthermore, IProp is compatible with any existing attribution-based explanation method. Extensive experiments on various explanation methods and DNN models verify that IProp significantly improves them on a variety of interpretability metrics.</description>

      <title>Hand Gesture Classification Based on Forearm Ultrasound Video Snippets Using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound based hand movement estimation is a crucial area of research with applications in human-machine interaction. Forearm ultrasound offers detailed information about muscle morphology changes during hand movement which can be used to estimate hand gestures. Previous work has focused on analyzing 2-Dimensional (2D) ultrasound image frames using techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, such 2D techniques do not capture temporal features from segments of ultrasound data corresponding to continuous hand movements. This study uses 3D CNN based techniques to capture spatio-temporal patterns within ultrasound video segments for gesture recognition. We compared the performance of a 2D convolution-based network with (2+1)D convolution-based, 3D convolution-based, and our proposed network. Our methodology enhanced the gesture classification accuracy to 98.8 +/- 0.9%, from 96.5 +/- 2.3% compared to a network trained with 2D convolution layers. These results demonstrate the advantages of using ultrasound video snippets for improving hand gesture classification performance.</description>

      <title>Underground Mapping and Localization Based on Ground-Penetrating Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D object reconstruction based on deep neural networks has gained increasing attention in recent years. However, 3D reconstruction of underground objects to generate point cloud maps remains a challenge. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is one of the most powerful and extensively used tools for detecting and locating underground objects such as plant root systems and pipelines, with its cost-effectiveness and continuously evolving technology. This paper introduces a parabolic signal detection network based on deep convolutional neural networks, utilizing B-scan images from GPR sensors. The detected keypoints can aid in accurately fitting parabolic curves used to interpret the original GPR B-scan images as cross-sections of the object model. Additionally, a multi-task point cloud network was designed to perform both point cloud segmentation and completion simultaneously, filling in sparse point cloud maps. For unknown locations, GPR A-scan data can be used to match corresponding A-scan data in the constructed map, pinpointing the position to verify the accuracy of the map construction by the model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Frequency-based View Selection in Gaussian Splatting Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction is a fundamental problem in robotics perception. We examine the problem of active view selection to perform 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstructions with as few input images as possible. Although 3D Gaussian Splatting has made significant progress in image rendering and 3D reconstruction, the quality of the reconstruction is strongly impacted by the selection of 2D images and the estimation of camera poses through Structure-from-Motion (SfM) algorithms. Current methods to select views that rely on uncertainties from occlusions, depth ambiguities, or neural network predictions directly are insufficient to handle the issue and struggle to generalize to new scenes. By ranking the potential views in the frequency domain, we are able to effectively estimate the potential information gain of new viewpoints without ground truth data. By overcoming current constraints on model architecture and efficacy, our method achieves state-of-the-art results in view selection, demonstrating its potential for efficient image-based 3D reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Proactive Schemes: A Survey of Adversarial Attacks for Social Good</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks in computer vision exploit the vulnerabilities of machine learning models by introducing subtle perturbations to input data, often leading to incorrect predictions or classifications. These attacks have evolved in sophistication with the advent of deep learning, presenting significant challenges in critical applications, which can be harmful for society. However, there is also a rich line of research from a transformative perspective that leverages adversarial techniques for social good. Specifically, we examine the rise of proactive schemes-methods that encrypt input data using additional signals termed templates, to enhance the performance of deep learning models. By embedding these imperceptible templates into digital media, proactive schemes are applied across various applications, from simple image enhancements to complicated deep learning frameworks to aid performance, as compared to the passive schemes, which don't change the input data distribution for their framework. The survey delves into the methodologies behind these proactive schemes, the encryption and learning processes, and their application to modern computer vision and natural language processing applications. Additionally, it discusses the challenges, potential vulnerabilities, and future directions for proactive schemes, ultimately highlighting their potential to foster the responsible and secure advancement of deep learning technologies.</description>

      <title>A Unified Hallucination Mitigation Framework for Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucination is a common problem for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with long generations which is difficult to eradicate. The generation with hallucinations is partially inconsistent with the image content. To mitigate hallucination, current studies either focus on the process of model inference or the results of model generation, but the solutions they design sometimes do not deal appropriately with various types of queries and the hallucinations of the generations about these queries. To accurately deal with various hallucinations, we present a unified framework, Dentist, for hallucination mitigation. The core step is to first classify the queries, then perform different processes of hallucination mitigation based on the classification result, just like a dentist first observes the teeth and then makes a plan. In a simple deployment, Dentist can classify queries as perception or reasoning and easily mitigate potential hallucinations in answers which has been demonstrated in our experiments. On MMbench, we achieve a 13.44%/10.2%/15.8% improvement in accuracy on Image Quality, a Coarse Perception visual question answering (VQA) task, over the baseline InstructBLIP/LLaVA/VisualGLM.</description>

Abstract: Critical Raw Materials (CRMs) such as copper, manganese, gallium, and various rare earths have great importance for the electronic industry. To increase the concentration of individual CRMs and thus make their extraction from Waste Printed Circuit Boards (WPCBs) convenient, we have proposed a practical approach that involves selective disassembling of the different types of electronic components from WPCBs using mechatronic systems guided by artificial vision techniques. In this paper we evaluate the real-time accuracy of electronic component detection and localization of the Real-Time DEtection TRansformer model architecture. Transformers have recently become very popular for the extraordinary results obtained in natural language processing and machine translation. Also in this case, the transformer model achieves very good performances, often superior to those of the latest state of the art object detection and localization models YOLOv8 and YOLOv9.</description>

      <title>GSplatLoc: Grounding Keypoint Descriptors into 3D Gaussian Splatting for Improved Visual Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although various visual localization approaches exist, such as scene coordinate and pose regression, these methods often struggle with high memory consumption or extensive optimization requirements. To address these challenges, we utilize recent advancements in novel view synthesis, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), to enhance localization. 3DGS allows for the compact encoding of both 3D geometry and scene appearance with its spatial features. Our method leverages the dense description maps produced by XFeat's lightweight keypoint detection and description model. We propose distilling these dense keypoint descriptors into 3DGS to improve the model's spatial understanding, leading to more accurate camera pose predictions through 2D-3D correspondences. After estimating an initial pose, we refine it using a photometric warping loss. Benchmarking on popular indoor and outdoor datasets shows that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art Neural Render Pose (NRP) methods, including NeRFMatch and PNeRFLoc.</description>

      <title>Low Latency Point Cloud Rendering with Learned Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud is a critical 3D representation with many emerging applications. Because of the point sparsity and irregularity, high-quality rendering of point clouds is challenging and often requires complex computations to recover the continuous surface representation. On the other hand, to avoid visual discomfort, the motion-to-photon latency has to be very short, under 10 ms. Existing rendering solutions lack in either quality or speed. To tackle these challenges, we present a framework that unlocks interactive, free-viewing and high-fidelity point cloud rendering. We train a generic neural network to estimate 3D elliptical Gaussians from arbitrary point clouds and use differentiable surface splatting to render smooth texture and surface normal for arbitrary views. Our approach does not require per-scene optimization, and enable real-time rendering of dynamic point cloud. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed solution enjoys superior visual quality and speed, as well as generalizability to different scene content and robustness to compression artifacts.

      <title>Prompt Sliders for Fine-Grained Control, Editing and Erasing of Concepts in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently surpassed GANs in image synthesis and editing, offering superior image quality and diversity. However, achieving precise control over attributes in generated images remains a challenge. Concept Sliders introduced a method for fine-grained image control and editing by learning concepts (attributes/objects). However, this approach adds parameters and increases inference time due to the loading and unloading of Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) used for learning concepts. These adapters are model-specific and require retraining for different architectures, such as Stable Diffusion (SD) v1.5 and SD-XL. In this paper, we propose a straightforward textual inversion method to learn concepts through text embeddings, which are generalizable across models that share the same text encoder, including different versions of the SD model. We refer to our method as Prompt Sliders. Besides learning new concepts, we also show that Prompt Sliders can be used to erase undesirable concepts such as artistic styles or mature content. Our method is 30% faster than using LoRAs because it eliminates the need to load and unload adapters and introduces no additional parameters aside from the target concept text embedding. Each concept embedding only requires 3KB of storage compared to the 8922KB or more required for each LoRA adapter, making our approach more computationally efficient.

      <title>Source-Free Domain Adaptation for YOLO Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging problem in object detection, where a pre-trained source model is adapted to a new target domain without using any source domain data for privacy and efficiency reasons. Most state-of-the-art SFDA methods for object detection have been proposed for Faster-RCNN, a detector that is known to have high computational complexity. This paper focuses on domain adaptation techniques for real-world vision systems, particularly for the YOLO family of single-shot detectors known for their fast baselines and practical applications. Our proposed SFDA method - Source-Free YOLO (SF-YOLO) - relies on a teacher-student framework in which the student receives images with a learned, target domain-specific augmentation, allowing the model to be trained with only unlabeled target data and without requiring feature alignment. A challenge with self-training using a mean-teacher architecture in the absence of labels is the rapid decline of accuracy due to noisy or drifting pseudo-labels. To address this issue, a teacher-to-student communication mechanism is introduced to help stabilize the training and reduce the reliance on annotated target data for model selection. Despite its simplicity, our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art detectors on several challenging benchmark datasets, even sometimes outperforming methods that use source data for adaptation.</description>

      <title>SelectiveKD: A semi-supervised framework for cancer detection in DBT through Knowledge Distillation and Pseudo-labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When developing Computer Aided Detection (CAD) systems for Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT), the complexity arising from the volumetric nature of the modality poses significant technical challenges for obtaining large-scale accurate annotations. Without access to large-scale annotations, the resulting model may not generalize to different domains. Given the costly nature of obtaining DBT annotations, how to effectively increase the amount of data used for training DBT CAD systems remains an open challenge.
  In this paper, we present SelectiveKD, a semi-supervised learning framework for building cancer detection models for DBT, which only requires a limited number of annotated slices to reach high performance. We achieve this by utilizing unlabeled slices available in a DBT stack through a knowledge distillation framework in which the teacher model provides a supervisory signal to the student model for all slices in the DBT volume. Our framework mitigates the potential noise in the supervisory signal from a sub-optimal teacher by implementing a selective dataset expansion strategy using pseudo labels.
  We evaluate our approach with a large-scale real-world dataset of over 10,000 DBT exams collected from multiple device manufacturers and locations. The resulting SelectiveKD process effectively utilizes unannotated slices from a DBT stack, leading to significantly improved cancer classification performance (AUC) and generalization performance.</description>

      <title>EventHallusion: Diagnosing Event Hallucinations in Video LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in the video comprehension field. Despite remarkable content reasoning and instruction following capabilities they demonstrated, the hallucination problem of these VideoLLMs is less explored compared with its counterpart in the image domain. To mitigate this gap, we first propose EventHallusion, a novel benchmark that focuses on assessing the VideoLMMs' hallucination phenomenon on video event comprehension. Based on the observation that existing VideoLLMs are entangled with the priors stemming from their foundation models, our EventHallusion is curated by meticulously collecting videos and annotating questions to intentionally mislead the VideoLLMs into interpreting events based on these priors rather than accurately understanding the video content. On the other hand, we also propose a simple yet effective method, called Temporal Contrastive Decoding (TCD), to tackle the hallucination problems of VideoLLMs. The proposed TCD suppresses the model's preference toward their priors by comparing the original video with a constructed counterpart, whose temporal cues are disrupted, during the autoregressive decoding stage. Through comprehensive evaluation of eight open-source and two closed-source VideoLLMs on the proposed EventHallusion benchmark, we find that the open-source models suffer significantly from hallucination problems, whereas the closed-source models perform markedly better. By further equipping open-sourced VideoLLMs with the proposed TCD approach, evident performance improvements are achieved across most metrics in the EventHallusion benchmark. Our codes and benchmark data are available at https://github.com/Stevetich/EventHallusion.</description>

      <title>FAFA: Frequency-Aware Flow-Aided Self-Supervision for Underwater Object Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although methods for estimating the pose of objects in indoor scenes have achieved great success, the pose estimation of underwater objects remains challenging due to difficulties brought by the complex underwater environment, such as degraded illumination, blurring, and the substantial cost of obtaining real annotations. In response, we introduce FAFA, a Frequency-Aware Flow-Aided self-supervised framework for 6D pose estimation of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). Essentially, we first train a frequency-aware flow-based pose estimator on synthetic data, where an FFT-based augmentation approach is proposed to facilitate the network in capturing domain-invariant features and target domain styles from a frequency perspective. Further, we perform self-supervised training by enforcing flow-aided multi-level consistencies to adapt it to the real-world underwater environment. Our framework relies solely on the 3D model and RGB images, alleviating the need for any real pose annotations or other-modality data like depths. We evaluate the effectiveness of FAFA on common underwater object pose benchmarks and showcase significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Semi-LLIE: Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning with Mamba-based Low-light Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the impressive advancements made in recent low-light image enhancement techniques, the scarcity of paired data has emerged as a significant obstacle to further advancements. This work proposes a mean-teacher-based semi-supervised low-light enhancement (Semi-LLIE) framework that integrates the unpaired data into model training. The mean-teacher technique is a prominent semi-supervised learning method, successfully adopted for addressing high-level and low-level vision tasks. However, two primary issues hinder the naive mean-teacher method from attaining optimal performance in low-light image enhancement. Firstly, pixel-wise consistency loss is insufficient for transferring realistic illumination distribution from the teacher to the student model, which results in color cast in the enhanced images. Secondly, cutting-edge image enhancement approaches fail to effectively cooperate with the mean-teacher framework to restore detailed information in dark areas due to their tendency to overlook modeling structured information within local regions. To mitigate the above issues, we first introduce a semantic-aware contrastive loss to faithfully transfer the illumination distribution, contributing to enhancing images with natural colors. Then, we design a Mamba-based low-light image enhancement backbone to effectively enhance Mamba's local region pixel relationship representation ability with a multi-scale feature learning scheme, facilitating the generation of images with rich textural details. Further, we propose novel perceptive loss based on the large-scale vision-language Recognize Anything Model (RAM) to help generate enhanced images with richer textual details. The experimental results indicate that our Semi-LLIE surpasses existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative metrics.</description>

      <title>DeformStream: Deformation-based Adaptive Volumetric Video Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volumetric video streaming offers immersive 3D experiences but faces significant challenges due to high bandwidth requirements and latency issues in transmitting detailed content in real time. Traditional methods like point cloud streaming compromise visual quality when zoomed in, and neural rendering techniques are too computationally intensive for real-time use. Though mesh-based streaming stands out by preserving surface detail and connectivity, offering a more refined representation for 3D content, traditional mesh streaming methods typically transmit data on a per-frame basis, failing to take full advantage of temporal redundancies across frames. This results in inefficient bandwidth usage and poor adaptability to fluctuating network conditions. We introduce Deformation-based Adaptive Volumetric Video Streaming, a novel framework that enhances volumetric video streaming performance by leveraging the inherent deformability of mesh-based representations. DeformStream uses embedded deformation to reconstruct subsequent frames from inter-frame motion, significantly reducing bandwidth usage while ensuring visual coherence between frames. To address frame reconstruction overhead and network adaptability, we formulate a new QoE model that accounts for client-side deformation latency and design a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize the trade-off between visual quality and bandwidth consumption under varying network conditions. Our evaluation demonstrates that Deformation-based Adaptive Volumetric Video Streaming outperforms existing mesh-based streaming systems in both bandwidth efficiency and visual quality, offering a robust solution for real-time volumetric video applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Nighttime UAV Tracking with Light Distribution Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual object tracking has boosted extensive intelligent applications for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) enhancers for nighttime UAV tracking always neglect the uneven light distribution in low-light images, inevitably leading to excessive enhancement in scenarios with complex illumination. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel enhancer, i.e., LDEnhancer, enhancing nighttime UAV tracking with light distribution suppression. Specifically, a novel image content refinement module is developed to decompose the light distribution information and image content information in the feature space, allowing for the targeted enhancement of the image content information. Then this work designs a new light distribution generation module to capture light distribution effectively. The features with light distribution information and image content information are fed into the different parameter estimation modules, respectively, for the parameter map prediction. Finally, leveraging two parameter maps, an innovative interweave iteration adjustment is proposed for the collaborative pixel-wise adjustment of low-light images. Additionally, a challenging nighttime UAV tracking dataset with uneven light distribution, namely NAT2024-2, is constructed to provide a comprehensive evaluation, which contains 40 challenging sequences with over 74K frames in total. Experimental results on the authoritative UAV benchmarks and the proposed NAT2024-2 demonstrate that LDEnhancer outperforms other SOTA low-light enhancers for nighttime UAV tracking. Furthermore, real-world tests on a typical UAV platform with an NVIDIA Orin NX confirm the practicality and efficiency of LDEnhancer. The code is available at https://github.com/vision4robotics/LDEnhancer.</description>

      <title>Progressive Representation Learning for Real-Time UAV Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual object tracking has significantly promoted autonomous applications for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, learning robust object representations for UAV tracking is especially challenging in complex dynamic environments, when confronted with aspect ratio change and occlusion. These challenges severely alter the original information of the object. To handle the above issues, this work proposes a novel progressive representation learning framework for UAV tracking, i.e., PRL-Track. Specifically, PRL-Track is divided into coarse representation learning and fine representation learning. For coarse representation learning, two innovative regulators, which rely on appearance and semantic information, are designed to mitigate appearance interference and capture semantic information. Furthermore, for fine representation learning, a new hierarchical modeling generator is developed to intertwine coarse object representations. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PRL-Track delivers exceptional performance on three authoritative UAV tracking benchmarks. Real-world tests indicate that the proposed PRL-Track realizes superior tracking performance with 42.6 frames per second on the typical UAV platform equipped with an edge smart camera. The code, model, and demo videos are available at \url{https://github.com/vision4robotics/PRL-Track}.</description>

      <title>TalkinNeRF: Animatable Neural Fields for Full-Body Talking Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that learns a dynamic neural radiance field (NeRF) for full-body talking humans from monocular videos. Prior work represents only the body pose or the face. However, humans communicate with their full body, combining body pose, hand gestures, as well as facial expressions. In this work, we propose TalkinNeRF, a unified NeRF-based network that represents the holistic 4D human motion. Given a monocular video of a subject, we learn corresponding modules for the body, face, and hands, that are combined together to generate the final result. To capture complex finger articulation, we learn an additional deformation field for the hands. Our multi-identity representation enables simultaneous training for multiple subjects, as well as robust animation under completely unseen poses. It can also generalize to novel identities, given only a short video as input. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for animating full-body talking humans, with fine-grained hand articulation and facial expressions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating aerial imagery-based scene generation into applications like autonomous driving and gaming enhances realism in 3D environments, but challenges remain in creating detailed content for occluded areas and ensuring real-time, consistent rendering. In this paper, we introduce Skyeyes, a novel framework that can generate photorealistic sequences of ground view images using only aerial view inputs, thereby creating a ground roaming experience. More specifically, we combine a 3D representation with a view consistent generation model, which ensures coherence between generated images. This method allows for the creation of geometrically consistent ground view images, even with large view gaps. The images maintain improved spatial-temporal coherence and realism, enhancing scene comprehension and visualization from aerial perspectives. To the best of our knowledge, there are no publicly available datasets that contain pairwise geo-aligned aerial and ground view imagery. Therefore, we build a large, synthetic, and geo-aligned dataset using Unreal Engine. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses on this synthetic dataset display superior results compared to other leading synthesis approaches. See the project page for more results: https://chaoren2357.github.io/website-skyeyes/.</description>

      <title>Layout-Corrector: Alleviating Layout Sticking Phenomenon in Discrete Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layout generation is a task to synthesize a harmonious layout with elements characterized by attributes such as category, position, and size. Human designers experiment with the placement and modification of elements to create aesthetic layouts, however, we observed that current discrete diffusion models (DDMs) struggle to correct inharmonious layouts after they have been generated. In this paper, we first provide novel insights into layout sticking phenomenon in DDMs and then propose a simple yet effective layout-assessment module Layout-Corrector, which works in conjunction with existing DDMs to address the layout sticking problem. We present a learning-based module capable of identifying inharmonious elements within layouts, considering overall layout harmony characterized by complex composition. During the generation process, Layout-Corrector evaluates the correctness of each token in the generated layout, reinitializing those with low scores to the ungenerated state. The DDM then uses the high-scored tokens as clues to regenerate the harmonized tokens. Layout-Corrector, tested on common benchmarks, consistently boosts layout-generation performance when in conjunction with various state-of-the-art DDMs. Furthermore, our extensive analysis demonstrates that the Layout-Corrector (1) successfully identifies erroneous tokens, (2) facilitates control over the fidelity-diversity trade-off, and (3) significantly mitigates the performance drop associated with fast sampling.</description>

      <title>Pix2Next: Leveraging Vision Foundation Models for RGB to NIR Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes Pix2Next, a novel image-to-image translation framework designed to address the challenge of generating high-quality Near-Infrared (NIR) images from RGB inputs. Our approach leverages a state-of-the-art Vision Foundation Model (VFM) within an encoder-decoder architecture, incorporating cross-attention mechanisms to enhance feature integration. This design captures detailed global representations and preserves essential spectral characteristics, treating RGB-to-NIR translation as more than a simple domain transfer problem. A multi-scale PatchGAN discriminator ensures realistic image generation at various detail levels, while carefully designed loss functions couple global context understanding with local feature preservation. We performed experiments on the RANUS dataset to demonstrate Pix2Next's advantages in quantitative metrics and visual quality, improving the FID score by 34.81% compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of Pix2Next by showing improved performance on a downstream object detection task using generated NIR data to augment limited real NIR datasets. The proposed approach enables the scaling up of NIR datasets without additional data acquisition or annotation efforts, potentially accelerating advancements in NIR-based computer vision applications.</description>

      <title>Pose-Guided Fine-Grained Sign Language Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sign language videos are an important medium for spreading and learning sign language. However, most existing human image synthesis methods produce sign language images with details that are distorted, blurred, or structurally incorrect. They also produce sign language video frames with poor temporal consistency, with anomalies such as flickering and abrupt detail changes between the previous and next frames. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Pose-Guided Motion Model (PGMM) for generating fine-grained and motion-consistent sign language videos. Firstly, we propose a new Coarse Motion Module (CMM), which completes the deformation of features by optical flow warping, thus transfering the motion of coarse-grained structures without changing the appearance; Secondly, we propose a new Pose Fusion Module (PFM), which guides the modal fusion of RGB and pose features, thus completing the fine-grained generation. Finally, we design a new metric, Temporal Consistency Difference (TCD) to quantitatively assess the degree of temporal consistency of a video by comparing the difference between the frames of the reconstructed video and the previous and next frames of the target video. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in most benchmark tests, with visible improvements in details and temporal consistency.</description>

      <title>Vision-Language Model Fine-Tuning via Simple Parameter-Efficient Modification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have witnessed the success of prompt tuning and adapter tuning, while the classic model fine-tuning on inherent parameters seems to be overlooked. It is believed that fine-tuning the parameters of VLMs with few-shot samples corrupts the pre-trained knowledge since fine-tuning the CLIP model even degrades performance. In this paper, we revisit this viewpoint, and propose a new perspective: fine-tuning the specific parameters instead of all will uncover the power of classic model fine-tuning on VLMs. Through our meticulous study, we propose ClipFit, a simple yet effective method to fine-tune CLIP without introducing any overhead of extra parameters. We demonstrate that by only fine-tuning the specific bias terms and normalization layers, ClipFit can improve the performance of zero-shot CLIP by 7.27\% average harmonic mean accuracy. Lastly, to understand how fine-tuning in CLIPFit affects the pre-trained models, we conducted extensive experimental analyses w.r.t. changes in internal parameters and representations. We found that low-level text bias layers and the first layer normalization layer change much more than other layers. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/minglllli/CLIPFit}.</description>

      <title>EAGLE: Towards Efficient Arbitrary Referring Visual Prompts Comprehension for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have sparked great research interests owing to their exceptional content-reasoning and instruction-following capabilities. To effectively instruct an MLLM, in addition to conventional language expressions, the practice of referring to objects by painting with brushes on images has emerged as a prevalent tool (referred to as "referring visual prompts") due to its efficacy in aligning the user's intention with specific image regions. To accommodate the most common referring visual prompts, namely points, boxes, and masks, existing approaches initially utilize specialized feature encoding modules to capture the semantics of the highlighted areas indicated by these prompts. Subsequently, these encoded region features are adapted to MLLMs through fine-tuning on a meticulously curated multimodal instruction dataset. However, such designs suffer from redundancy in architecture. Moreover, they face challenges in effectively generalizing when encountering a diverse range of arbitrary referring visual prompts in real-life scenarios. To address the above issues, we propose EAGLE, a novel MLLM that empowers comprehension of arbitrary referring visual prompts with less training efforts than existing approaches. Specifically, our EAGLE maintains the innate format of the referring visual prompts as colored patches rendered on the given image for conducting the instruction tuning. Our approach embeds referring visual prompts as spatial concepts conveying specific spatial areas comprehensible to the MLLM, with the semantic comprehension of these regions originating from the MLLM itself. Besides, we also propose a Geometry-Agnostic Learning paradigm (GAL) to further disentangle the MLLM's region-level comprehension with the specific formats of referring visual prompts. Extensive experiments are conducted to prove the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Commonly Interesting Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Images tell stories, trigger emotions, and let us recall memories -- they make us think. Thus, they have the ability to attract and hold one's attention, which is the definition of being "interesting". Yet, the appeal of an image is highly subjective. Looking at the image of my son taking his first steps will always bring me back to this emotional moment, while it is just a blurry, quickly taken snapshot to most others. Preferences vary widely: some adore cats, others are dog enthusiasts, and a third group may not be fond of either. We argue that every image can be interesting to a particular observer under certain circumstances. This work particularly emphasizes subjective preferences. However, our analysis of 2.5k image collections from diverse users of the photo-sharing platform Flickr reveals that specific image characteristics make them commonly more interesting. For instance, images, including professionally taken landscapes, appeal broadly due to their aesthetic qualities. In contrast, subjectively interesting images, such as those depicting personal or niche community events, resonate on a more individual level, often evoking personal memories and emotions.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Maze of Explainable AI: A Systematic Approach to Evaluating Methods and Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is a rapidly growing domain with a myriad of proposed methods as well as metrics aiming to evaluate their efficacy. However, current studies are often of limited scope, examining only a handful of XAI methods and ignoring underlying design parameters for performance, such as the model architecture or the nature of input data. Moreover, they often rely on one or a few metrics and neglect thorough validation, increasing the risk of selection bias and ignoring discrepancies among metrics. These shortcomings leave practitioners confused about which method to choose for their problem. In response, we introduce LATEC, a large-scale benchmark that critically evaluates 17 prominent XAI methods using 20 distinct metrics. We systematically incorporate vital design parameters like varied architectures and diverse input modalities, resulting in 7,560 examined combinations. Through LATEC, we showcase the high risk of conflicting metrics leading to unreliable rankings and consequently propose a more robust evaluation scheme. Further, we comprehensively evaluate various XAI methods to assist practitioners in selecting appropriate methods aligning with their needs. Curiously, the emerging top-performing method, Expected Gradients, is not examined in any relevant related study. LATEC reinforces its role in future XAI research by publicly releasing all 326k saliency maps and 378k metric scores as a (meta-)evaluation dataset.</description>

      <title>Statewide Visual Geolocalization in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a method that is able to predict the geolocation of a street-view photo taken in the wild within a state-sized search region by matching against a database of aerial reference imagery. We partition the search region into geographical cells and train a model to map cells and corresponding photos into a joint embedding space that is used to perform retrieval at test time. The model utilizes aerial images for each cell at multiple levels-of-detail to provide sufficient information about the surrounding scene. We propose a novel layout of the search region with consistent cell resolutions that allows scaling to large geographical regions. Experiments demonstrate that the method successfully localizes 60.6% of all non-panoramic street-view photos uploaded to the crowd-sourcing platform Mapillary in the state of Massachusetts to within 50m of their ground-truth location.

      <title>MaViLS, a Benchmark Dataset for Video-to-Slide Alignment, Assessing Baseline Accuracy with a Multimodal Alignment Algorithm Leveraging Speech, OCR, and Visual Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a benchmark dataset for aligning lecture videos with corresponding slides and introduces a novel multimodal algorithm leveraging features from speech, text, and images. It achieves an average accuracy of 0.82 in comparison to SIFT (0.56) while being approximately 11 times faster. Using dynamic programming the algorithm tries to determine the optimal slide sequence. The results show that penalizing slide transitions increases accuracy. Features obtained via optical character recognition (OCR) contribute the most to a high matching accuracy, followed by image features. The findings highlight that audio transcripts alone provide valuable information for alignment and are beneficial if OCR data is lacking. Variations in matching accuracy across different lectures highlight the challenges associated with video quality and lecture style. The novel multimodal algorithm demonstrates robustness to some of these challenges, underscoring the potential of the approach.</description>

      <title>MixPolyp: Integrating Mask, Box and Scribble Supervision for Enhanced Polyp Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limited by the expensive labeling, polyp segmentation models are plagued by data shortages. To tackle this, we propose the mixed supervised polyp segmentation paradigm (MixPolyp). Unlike traditional models relying on a single type of annotation, MixPolyp combines diverse annotation types (mask, box, and scribble) within a single model, thereby expanding the range of available data and reducing labeling costs. To achieve this, MixPolyp introduces three novel supervision losses to handle various annotations: Subspace Projection loss (L_SP), Binary Minimum Entropy loss (L_BME), and Linear Regularization loss (L_LR). For box annotations, L_SP eliminates shape inconsistencies between the prediction and the supervision. For scribble annotations, L_BME provides supervision for unlabeled pixels through minimum entropy constraint, thereby alleviating supervision sparsity. Furthermore, L_LR provides dense supervision by enforcing consistency among the predictions, thus reducing the non-uniqueness. These losses are independent of the model structure, making them generally applicable. They are used only during training, adding no computational cost during inference. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate MixPolyp's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Spacewalker: Traversing Representation Spaces for Fast Interactive Exploration and Annotation of Unstructured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unstructured data in industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing presents significant challenges for efficient analysis and decision making. Detecting patterns within this data and understanding their impact is critical but complex without the right tools. Traditionally, these tasks relied on the expertise of data analysts or labor-intensive manual reviews. In response, we introduce Spacewalker, an interactive tool designed to explore and annotate data across multiple modalities. Spacewalker allows users to extract data representations and visualize them in low-dimensional spaces, enabling the detection of semantic similarities. Through extensive user studies, we assess Spacewalker's effectiveness in data annotation and integrity verification. Results show that the tool's ability to traverse latent spaces and perform multi-modal queries significantly enhances the user's capacity to quickly identify relevant data. Moreover, Spacewalker allows for annotation speed-ups far superior to conventional methods, making it a promising tool for efficiently navigating unstructured data and improving decision making processes. The code of this work is open-source and can be found at: https://github.com/code-lukas/Spacewalker</description>

      <title>Topological SLAM in colonoscopies leveraging deep features and topological priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ColonSLAM, a system that combines classical multiple-map metric SLAM with deep features and topological priors to create topological maps of the whole colon. The SLAM pipeline by itself is able to create disconnected individual metric submaps representing locations from short video subsections of the colon, but is not able to merge covisible submaps due to deformations and the limited performance of the SIFT descriptor in the medical domain. ColonSLAM is guided by topological priors and combines a deep localization network trained to distinguish if two images come from the same place or not and the soft verification of a transformer-based matching network, being able to relate far-in-time submaps during an exploration, grouping them in nodes imaging the same colon place, building more complex maps than any other approach in the literature. We demonstrate our approach in the Endomapper dataset, showing its potential for producing maps of the whole colon in real human explorations. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/endomapper/ColonSLAM.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Deep Learning Models for Object Detection on Edge Computing Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern applications, such as autonomous vehicles, require deploying deep learning algorithms on resource-constrained edge devices for real-time image and video processing. However, there is limited understanding of the efficiency and performance of various object detection models on these devices. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art object detection models, including YOLOv8 (Nano, Small, Medium), EfficientDet Lite (Lite0, Lite1, Lite2), and SSD (SSD MobileNet V1, SSDLite MobileDet). We deployed these models on popular edge devices like the Raspberry Pi 3, 4, and 5 with/without TPU accelerators, and Jetson Orin Nano, collecting key performance metrics such as energy consumption, inference time, and Mean Average Precision (mAP). Our findings highlight that lower mAP models such as SSD MobileNet V1 are more energy-efficient and faster in inference, whereas higher mAP models like YOLOv8 Medium generally consume more energy and have slower inference, though with exceptions when accelerators like TPUs are used. Among the edge devices, Jetson Orin Nano stands out as the fastest and most energy-efficient option for request handling, despite having the highest idle energy consumption. These results emphasize the need to balance accuracy, speed, and energy efficiency when deploying deep learning models on edge devices, offering valuable guidance for practitioners and researchers selecting models and devices for their applications.</description>

      <title>Spotlight Text Detector: Spotlight on Candidate Regions Like a Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The irregular contour representation is one of the tough challenges in scene text detection. Although segmentation-based methods have achieved significant progress with the help of flexible pixel prediction, the overlap of geographically close texts hinders detecting them separately. To alleviate this problem, some shrink-based methods predict text kernels and expand them to restructure texts. However, the text kernel is an artificial object with incomplete semantic features that are prone to incorrect or missing detection. In addition, different from the general objects, the geometry features (aspect ratio, scale, and shape) of scene texts vary significantly, which makes it difficult to detect them accurately. To consider the above problems, we propose an effective spotlight text detector (STD), which consists of a spotlight calibration module (SCM) and a multivariate information extraction module (MIEM). The former concentrates efforts on the candidate kernel, like a camera focus on the target. It obtains candidate features through a mapping filter and calibrates them precisely to eliminate some false positive samples. The latter designs different shape schemes to explore multiple geometric features for scene texts. It helps extract various spatial relationships to improve the model's ability to recognize kernel regions. Ablation studies prove the effectiveness of the designed SCM and MIEM. Extensive experiments verify that our STD is superior to existing state-of-the-art methods on various datasets, including ICDAR2015, CTW1500, MSRA-TD500, and Total-Text.</description>

      <title>XAI-guided Insulator Anomaly Detection for Imbalanced Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power grids serve as a vital component in numerous industries, seamlessly delivering electrical energy to industrial processes and technologies, making their safe and reliable operation indispensable. However, powerlines can be hard to inspect due to difficult terrain or harsh climatic conditions. Therefore, unmanned aerial vehicles are increasingly deployed to inspect powerlines, resulting in a substantial stream of visual data which requires swift and accurate processing. Deep learning methods have become widely popular for this task, proving to be a valuable asset in fault detection. In particular, the detection of insulator defects is crucial for predicting powerline failures, since their malfunction can lead to transmission disruptions. It is therefore of great interest to continuously maintain and rigorously inspect insulator components. In this work we propose a novel pipeline to tackle this task. We utilize state-of-the-art object detection to detect and subsequently classify individual insulator anomalies. Our approach addresses dataset challenges such as imbalance and motion-blurred images through a fine-tuning methodology which allows us to alter the classification focus of the model by increasing the classification accuracy of anomalous insulators. In addition, we employ explainable-AI tools for precise localization and explanation of anomalies. This proposed method contributes to the field of anomaly detection, particularly vision-based industrial inspection and predictive maintenance. We significantly improve defect detection accuracy by up to 13%, while also offering a detailed analysis of model mis-classifications and localization quality, showcasing the potential of our method on real-world data.</description>

      <title>Focus Entirety and Perceive Environment for Arbitrary-Shaped Text Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the diversity of scene text in aspects such as font, color, shape, and size, accurately and efficiently detecting text is still a formidable challenge. Among the various detection approaches, segmentation-based approaches have emerged as prominent contenders owing to their flexible pixel-level predictions. However, these methods typically model text instances in a bottom-up manner, which is highly susceptible to noise. In addition, the prediction of pixels is isolated without introducing pixel-feature interaction, which also influences the detection performance. To alleviate these problems, we propose a multi-information level arbitrary-shaped text detector consisting of a focus entirety module (FEM) and a perceive environment module (PEM). The former extracts instance-level features and adopts a top-down scheme to model texts to reduce the influence of noises. Specifically, it assigns consistent entirety information to pixels within the same instance to improve their cohesion. In addition, it emphasizes the scale information, enabling the model to distinguish varying scale texts effectively. The latter extracts region-level information and encourages the model to focus on the distribution of positive samples in the vicinity of a pixel, which perceives environment information. It treats the kernel pixels as positive samples and helps the model differentiate text and kernel features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the FEM's ability to efficiently support the model in handling different scale texts and confirm the PEM can assist in perceiving pixels more accurately by focusing on pixel vicinities. Comparisons show the proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on four public datasets.</description>

      <title>Explicitly Modeling Pre-Cortical Vision with a Neuro-Inspired Front-End Improves CNN Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel at clean image classification, they struggle to classify images corrupted with different common corruptions, limiting their real-world applicability. Recent work has shown that incorporating a CNN front-end block that simulates some features of the primate primary visual cortex (V1) can improve overall model robustness. Here, we expand on this approach by introducing two novel biologically-inspired CNN model families that incorporate a new front-end block designed to simulate pre-cortical visual processing. RetinaNet, a hybrid architecture containing the novel front-end followed by a standard CNN back-end, shows a relative robustness improvement of 12.3% when compared to the standard model; and EVNet, which further adds a V1 block after the pre-cortical front-end, shows a relative gain of 18.5%. The improvement in robustness was observed for all the different corruption categories, though accompanied by a small decrease in clean image accuracy, and generalized to a different back-end architecture. These findings show that simulating multiple stages of early visual processing in CNN early layers provides cumulative benefits for model robustness.</description>

      <title>IRASNet: Improved Feature-Level Clutter Reduction for Domain Generalized SAR-ATR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, computer-aided design models and electromagnetic simulations have been used to augment synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for deep learning. However, an automatic target recognition (ATR) model struggles with domain shift when using synthetic data because the model learns specific clutter patterns present in such data, which disturbs performance when applied to measured data with different clutter distributions. This study proposes a framework particularly designed for domain-generalized SAR-ATR called IRASNet, enabling effective feature-level clutter reduction and domain-invariant feature learning. First, we propose a clutter reduction module (CRM) that maximizes the signal-to-clutter ratio on feature maps. The module reduces the impact of clutter at the feature level while preserving target and shadow information, thereby improving ATR performance. Second, we integrate adversarial learning with CRM to extract clutter-reduced domain-invariant features. The integration bridges the gap between synthetic and measured datasets without requiring measured data during training. Third, we improve feature extraction from target and shadow regions by implementing a positional supervision task using mask ground truth encoding. The improvement enhances the ability of the model to discriminate between classes. Our proposed IRASNet presents new state-of-the-art public SAR datasets utilizing target and shadow information to achieve superior performance across various test conditions. IRASNet not only enhances generalization performance but also significantly improves feature-level clutter reduction, making it a valuable advancement in the field of radar image pattern recognition.</description>

      <title>Robust Scene Change Detection Using Visual Foundation Models and Cross-Attention Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for scene change detection that leverages the robust feature extraction capabilities of a visual foundational model, DINOv2, and integrates full-image cross-attention to address key challenges such as varying lighting, seasonal variations, and viewpoint differences. In order to effectively learn correspondences and mis-correspondences between an image pair for the change detection task, we propose to a) ``freeze'' the backbone in order to retain the generality of dense foundation features, and b) employ ``full-image'' cross-attention to better tackle the viewpoint variations between the image pair. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets, VL-CMU-CD and PSCD, along with their viewpoint-varied versions. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in F1-score, particularly in scenarios involving geometric changes between image pairs. The results indicate our method's superior generalization capabilities over existing state-of-the-art approaches, showing robustness against photometric and geometric variations as well as better overall generalization when fine-tuned to adapt to new environments. Detailed ablation studies further validate the contributions of each component in our architecture. Source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>A Versatile and Differentiable Hand-Object Interaction Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthesizing accurate hands-object interactions (HOI) is critical for applications in Computer Vision, Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR). Despite recent advances, the accuracy of reconstructed or generated HOI leaves room for refinement. Some techniques have improved the accuracy of dense correspondences by shifting focus from generating explicit contacts to using rich HOI fields. Still, they lack full differentiability or continuity and are tailored to specific tasks. In contrast, we present a Coarse Hand-Object Interaction Representation (CHOIR), a novel, versatile and fully differentiable field for HOI modelling. CHOIR leverages discrete unsigned distances for continuous shape and pose encoding, alongside multivariate Gaussian distributions to represent dense contact maps with few parameters. To demonstrate the versatility of CHOIR we design JointDiffusion, a diffusion model to learn a grasp distribution conditioned on noisy hand-object interactions or only object geometries, for both refinement and synthesis applications. We demonstrate JointDiffusion's improvements over the SOTA in both applications: it increases the contact F1 score by $5\%$ for refinement and decreases the sim. displacement by $46\%$ for synthesis. Our experiments show that JointDiffusion with CHOIR yield superior contact accuracy and physical realism compared to SOTA methods designed for specific tasks. Our models and code will be publicly available to the research community.</description>

Abstract: We delve into the challenges of accurately estimating 3D human pose and shape in video surveillance scenarios. Beginning with the advocacy for metrics like W-MPJPE and W-PVE, which omit the (Procrustes) realignment step, to improve model evaluation, we then introduce RotAvat. This technique aims to enhance these metrics by refining the alignment of 3D meshes with the ground plane. Through qualitative comparisons, we demonstrate RotAvat's effectiveness in addressing the limitations of existing aproaches.</description>

      <title>Towards Unified 3D Hair Reconstruction from Single-View Portraits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-view 3D hair reconstruction is challenging, due to the wide range of shape variations among diverse hairstyles. Current state-of-the-art methods are specialized in recovering un-braided 3D hairs and often take braided styles as their failure cases, because of the inherent difficulty to define priors for complex hairstyles, whether rule-based or data-based. We propose a novel strategy to enable single-view 3D reconstruction for a variety of hair types via a unified pipeline. To achieve this, we first collect a large-scale synthetic multi-view hair dataset SynMvHair with diverse 3D hair in both braided and un-braided styles, and learn two diffusion priors specialized on hair. Then we optimize 3D Gaussian-based hair from the priors with two specially designed modules, i.e. view-wise and pixel-wise Gaussian refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that reconstructing braided and un-braided 3D hair from single-view images via a unified approach is possible and our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in recovering complex hairstyles. It is worth to mention that our method shows good generalization ability to real images, although it learns hair priors from synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Linking in Style: Understanding learned features in deep learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) learn abstract features to perform object classification, but understanding these features remains challenging due to difficult-to-interpret results or high computational costs. We propose an automatic method to visualize and systematically analyze learned features in CNNs. Specifically, we introduce a linking network that maps the penultimate layer of a pre-trained classifier to the latent space of a generative model (StyleGAN-XL), thereby enabling an interpretable, human-friendly visualization of the classifier's representations. Our findings indicate a congruent semantic order in both spaces, enabling a direct linear mapping between them. Training the linking network is computationally inexpensive and decoupled from training both the GAN and the classifier. We introduce an automatic pipeline that utilizes such GAN-based visualizations to quantify learned representations by analyzing activation changes in the classifier in the image domain. This quantification allows us to systematically study the learned representations in several thousand units simultaneously and to extract and visualize units selective for specific semantic concepts. Further, we illustrate how our method can be used to quantify and interpret the classifier's decision boundary using counterfactual examples. Overall, our method offers systematic and objective perspectives on learned abstract representations in CNNs. https://github.com/kaschube-lab/LinkingInStyle.git</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data representation in non-Euclidean spaces has proven effective for capturing hierarchical and complex relationships in real-world datasets. Hyperbolic spaces, in particular, provide efficient embeddings for hierarchical structures. This paper introduces the Hyperbolic Vision Transformer (HVT), a novel extension of the Vision Transformer (ViT) that integrates hyperbolic geometry. While traditional ViTs operate in Euclidean space, our method enhances the self-attention mechanism by leveraging hyperbolic distance and M\"obius transformations. This enables more effective modeling of hierarchical and relational dependencies in image data. We present rigorous mathematical formulations, showing how hyperbolic geometry can be incorporated into attention layers, feed-forward networks, and optimization. We offer improved performance for image classification using the ImageNet dataset.</description>

      <title>Towards Underwater Camouflaged Object Tracking: An Experimental Evaluation of SAM and SAM 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in visual object tracking, largely due to the availability of large-scale training datasets. However, existing tracking datasets are primarily focused on open-air scenarios, which greatly limits the development of object tracking in underwater environments. To address this issue, we take a step forward by proposing the first large-scale underwater camouflaged object tracking dataset, namely UW-COT. Based on the proposed dataset, this paper presents an experimental evaluation of several advanced visual object tracking methods and the latest advancements in image and video segmentation. Specifically, we compare the performance of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its updated version, SAM 2, in challenging underwater environments. Our findings highlight the improvements in SAM 2 over SAM, demonstrating its enhanced capability to handle the complexities of underwater camouflaged objects. Compared to current advanced visual object tracking methods, the latest video segmentation foundation model SAM 2 also exhibits significant advantages, providing valuable insights into the development of more effective tracking technologies for underwater scenarios. The dataset will be accessible at \color{magenta}{https://github.com/983632847/Awesome-Multimodal-Object-Tracking}.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Screen-Space Meshing Approach for Normal Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing surfaces from normals is a key component of photometric stereo. This work introduces an adaptive surface triangulation in the image domain and afterwards performs the normal integration on a triangle mesh. Our key insight is that surface curvature can be computed from normals. Based on the curvature, we identify flat areas and aggregate pixels into triangles. The approximation quality is controlled by a single user parameter facilitating a seamless generation of low- to high-resolution meshes. Compared to pixel grids, our triangle meshes adapt locally to surface details and allow for a sparser representation. Our new mesh-based formulation of the normal integration problem is strictly derived from discrete differential geometry and leads to well-conditioned linear systems. Results on real and synthetic data show that 10 to 100 times less vertices are required than pixels. Experiments suggest that this sparsity translates into a sublinear runtime in the number of pixels. For 64 MP normal maps, our meshing-first approach generates and integrates meshes in minutes while pixel-based approaches require hours just for the integration.</description>

      <title>Game4Loc: A UAV Geo-Localization Benchmark from Game Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vision-based geo-localization technology for UAV, serving as a secondary source of GPS information in addition to the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), can still operate independently in the GPS-denied environment. Recent deep learning based methods attribute this as the task of image matching and retrieval. By retrieving drone-view images in geo-tagged satellite image database, approximate localization information can be obtained. However, due to high costs and privacy concerns, it is usually difficult to obtain large quantities of drone-view images from a continuous area. Existing drone-view datasets are mostly composed of small-scale aerial photography with a strong assumption that there exists a perfect one-to-one aligned reference image for any query, leaving a significant gap from the practical localization scenario. In this work, we construct a large-range contiguous area UAV geo-localization dataset named GTA-UAV, featuring multiple flight altitudes, attitudes, scenes, and targets using modern computer games. Based on this dataset, we introduce a more practical UAV geo-localization task including partial matches of cross-view paired data, and expand the image-level retrieval to the actual localization in terms of distance (meters). For the construction of drone-view and satellite-view pairs, we adopt a weight-based contrastive learning approach, which allows for effective learning while avoiding additional post-processing matching steps. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our data and training method for UAV geo-localization, as well as the generalization capabilities to real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Generative Object Insertion in Gaussian Splatting with a Multi-View Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating and inserting new objects into 3D content is a compelling approach for achieving versatile scene recreation. Existing methods, which rely on SDS optimization or single-view inpainting, often struggle to produce high-quality results. To address this, we propose a novel method for object insertion in 3D content represented by Gaussian Splatting. Our approach introduces a multi-view diffusion model, dubbed MVInpainter, which is built upon a pre-trained stable video diffusion model to facilitate view-consistent object inpainting. Within MVInpainter, we incorporate a ControlNet-based conditional injection module to enable controlled and more predictable multi-view generation. After generating the multi-view inpainted results, we further propose a mask-aware 3D reconstruction technique to refine Gaussian Splatting reconstruction from these sparse inpainted views. By leveraging these fabricate techniques, our approach yields diverse results, ensures view-consistent and harmonious insertions, and produces better object quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <title>Face Forgery Detection with Elaborate Backbone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face Forgery Detection (FFD), or Deepfake detection, aims to determine whether a digital face is real or fake. Due to different face synthesis algorithms with diverse forgery patterns, FFD models often overfit specific patterns in training datasets, resulting in poor generalization to other unseen forgeries. This severe challenge requires FFD models to possess strong capabilities in representing complex facial features and extracting subtle forgery cues. Although previous FFD models directly employ existing backbones to represent and extract facial forgery cues, the critical role of backbones is often overlooked, particularly as their knowledge and capabilities are insufficient to address FFD challenges, inevitably limiting generalization. Therefore, it is essential to integrate the backbone pre-training configurations and seek practical solutions by revisiting the complete FFD workflow, from backbone pre-training and fine-tuning to inference of discriminant results. Specifically, we analyze the crucial contributions of backbones with different configurations in FFD task and propose leveraging the ViT network with self-supervised learning on real-face datasets to pre-train a backbone, equipping it with superior facial representation capabilities. We then build a competitive backbone fine-tuning framework that strengthens the backbone's ability to extract diverse forgery cues within a competitive learning mechanism. Moreover, we devise a threshold optimization mechanism that utilizes prediction confidence to improve the inference reliability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our FFD model with the elaborate backbone achieves excellent performance in FFD and extra face-related tasks, i.e., presentation attack detection.

      <title>NTIRE 2024 Challenge on Stereo Image Super-Resolution: Methods and Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper summarizes the 3rd NTIRE challenge on stereo image super-resolution (SR) with a focus on new solutions and results. The task of this challenge is to super-resolve a low-resolution stereo image pair to a high-resolution one with a magnification factor of x4 under a limited computational budget. Compared with single image SR, the major challenge of this challenge lies in how to exploit additional information in another viewpoint and how to maintain stereo consistency in the results. This challenge has 2 tracks, including one track on bicubic degradation and one track on real degradations. In total, 108 and 70 participants were successfully registered for each track, respectively. In the test phase, 14 and 13 teams successfully submitted valid results with PSNR (RGB) scores better than the baseline. This challenge establishes a new benchmark for stereo image SR.</description>

      <title>DALDA: Data Augmentation Leveraging Diffusion Model and LLM with Adaptive Guidance Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an effective data augmentation framework leveraging the Large Language Model (LLM) and Diffusion Model (DM) to tackle the challenges inherent in data-scarce scenarios. Recently, DMs have opened up the possibility of generating synthetic images to complement a few training images. However, increasing the diversity of synthetic images also raises the risk of generating samples outside the target distribution. Our approach addresses this issue by embedding novel semantic information into text prompts via LLM and utilizing real images as visual prompts, thus generating semantically rich images. To ensure that the generated images remain within the target distribution, we dynamically adjust the guidance weight based on each image's CLIPScore to control the diversity. Experimental results show that our method produces synthetic images with enhanced diversity while maintaining adherence to the target distribution. Consequently, our approach proves to be more efficient in the few-shot setting on several benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/kkyuhun94/dalda .</description>

      <title>Path-adaptive Spatio-Temporal State Space Model for Event-based Recognition with Arbitrary Duration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that capture the intensity changes asynchronously and output event streams with distinct advantages, such as high temporal resolution. To exploit event cameras for object/action recognition, existing methods predominantly sample and aggregate events in a second-level duration at every fixed temporal interval (or frequency). However, they often face difficulties in capturing the spatiotemporal relationships for longer, e.g., minute-level, events and generalizing across varying temporal frequencies. To fill the gap, we present a novel framework, dubbed PAST-SSM, exhibiting superior capacity in recognizing events with arbitrary duration (e.g., 0.1s to 4.5s) and generalizing to varying inference frequencies. Our key insight is to learn the spatiotemporal relationships from the encoded event features via the state space model (SSM) -- whose linear complexity makes it ideal for modeling high temporal resolution events with longer sequences. To achieve this goal, we first propose a Path-Adaptive Event Aggregation and Scan (PEAS) module to encode events of varying duration into features with fixed dimensions by adaptively scanning and selecting aggregated event frames. On top of PEAS, we introduce a novel Multi-faceted Selection Guiding (MSG) loss to minimize the randomness and redundancy of the encoded features. This subtly enhances the model generalization across different inference frequencies. Lastly, the SSM is employed to better learn the spatiotemporal properties from the encoded features. Moreover, we build a minute-level event-based recognition dataset, named ArDVS100, with arbitrary duration for the benefit of the community. Extensive experiments prove that our method outperforms prior arts by +3.45%, +0.38% and +8.31% on the DVS Action, SeAct and HARDVS datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Single Image, Any Face: Generalisable 3D Face Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The creation of 3D human face avatars from a single unconstrained image is a fundamental task that underlies numerous real-world vision and graphics applications. Despite the significant progress made in generative models, existing methods are either less suited in design for human faces or fail to generalise from the restrictive training domain to unconstrained facial images. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, Gen3D-Face, which generates 3D human faces with unconstrained single image input within a multi-view consistent diffusion framework. Given a specific input image, our model first produces multi-view images, followed by neural surface construction. To incorporate face geometry information in a generalisable manner, we utilise input-conditioned mesh estimation instead of ground-truth mesh along with synthetic multi-view training data. Importantly, we introduce a multi-view joint generation scheme to enhance appearance consistency among different views. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt and benchmark for creating photorealistic 3D human face avatars from single images for generic human subject across domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous alternatives for out-of-domain singe image 3D face generation and top competition for in-domain setting.</description>

      <title>Adverse Weather Optical Flow: Cumulative Homogeneous-Heterogeneous Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical flow has made great progress in clean scenes, while suffers degradation under adverse weather due to the violation of the brightness constancy and gradient continuity assumptions of optical flow. Typically, existing methods mainly adopt domain adaptation to transfer motion knowledge from clean to degraded domain through one-stage adaptation. However, this direct adaptation is ineffective, since there exists a large gap due to adverse weather and scene style between clean and real degraded domains. Moreover, even within the degraded domain itself, static weather (e.g., fog) and dynamic weather (e.g., rain) have different impacts on optical flow. To address above issues, we explore synthetic degraded domain as an intermediate bridge between clean and real degraded domains, and propose a cumulative homogeneous-heterogeneous adaptation framework for real adverse weather optical flow. Specifically, for clean-degraded transfer, our key insight is that static weather possesses the depth-association homogeneous feature which does not change the intrinsic motion of the scene, while dynamic weather additionally introduces the heterogeneous feature which results in a significant boundary discrepancy in warp errors between clean and degraded domains. For synthetic-real transfer, we figure out that cost volume correlation shares a similar statistical histogram between synthetic and real degraded domains, benefiting to holistically aligning the homogeneous correlation distribution for synthetic-real knowledge distillation. Under this unified framework, the proposed method can progressively and explicitly transfer knowledge from clean scenes to real adverse weather. In addition, we further collect a real adverse weather dataset with manually annotated optical flow labels and perform extensive experiments to verify the superiority of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>CNN Mixture-of-Depths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a novel approach that enhances the computational efficiency of CNNs by selectively processing channels based on their relevance to the current prediction. This method optimizes computational resources by dynamically selecting key channels in feature maps for focused processing within the convolutional blocks (Conv-Blocks), while skipping less relevant channels. Unlike conditional computation methods that require dynamic computation graphs, CNN MoD uses a static computation graph with fixed tensor sizes which improve hardware efficiency. It speeds up the training and inference processes without the need for customized CUDA kernels, unique loss functions, or finetuning. CNN MoD either matches the performance of traditional CNNs with reduced inference times, GMACs, and parameters, or exceeds their performance while maintaining similar inference times, GMACs, and parameters. For example, on ImageNet, ResNet86-MoD exceeds the performance of the standard ResNet50 by 0.45% with a 6% speedup on CPU and 5% on GPU. Moreover, ResNet75-MoD achieves the same performance as ResNet50 with a 25% speedup on CPU and 15% on GPU.</description>

      <title>PTQ4RIS: Post-Training Quantization for Referring Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), aims to segment the object referred by a given sentence in an image by understanding both visual and linguistic information. However, existing RIS methods tend to explore top-performance models, disregarding considerations for practical applications on resources-limited edge devices. This oversight poses a significant challenge for on-device RIS inference. To this end, we propose an effective and efficient post-training quantization framework termed PTQ4RIS. Specifically, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the root causes of performance degradation in RIS model quantization and propose dual-region quantization (DRQ) and reorder-based outlier-retained quantization (RORQ) to address the quantization difficulties in visual and text encoders. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks with different bits settings (from 8 to 4 bits) demonstrates its superior performance. Importantly, we are the first PTQ method specifically designed for the RIS task, highlighting the feasibility of PTQ in RIS applications. Code will be available at {https://github.com/gugu511yy/PTQ4RIS}.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Wavelet Scattering Network for image inpainting detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of image inpainting tools, especially those aimed at removing artifacts, has made digital image manipulation alarmingly accessible. This paper proposes several innovative ideas for detecting inpainting forgeries based on low level noise analysis by combining Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) for feature extraction with convolutional neural networks (CNN) for forged area detection and localization, and lastly by employing an innovative combination of texture segmentation with noise variance estimations. The DT-CWT offers significant advantages due to its shift-invariance, enhancing its robustness against subtle manipulations during the inpainting process. Furthermore, its directional selectivity allows for the detection of subtle artifacts introduced by inpainting within specific frequency bands and orientations. Various neural network architectures were evaluated and proposed. Lastly, we propose a fusion detection module that combines texture analysis with noise variance estimation to give the forged area. Our approach was benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods and demonstrated superior performance over all cited alternatives.

      <title>EventHDR: from Event to High-Speed HDR Videos and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras are innovative neuromorphic sensors that asynchronously capture the scene dynamics. Due to the event-triggering mechanism, such cameras record event streams with much shorter response latency and higher intensity sensitivity compared to conventional cameras. On the basis of these features, previous works have attempted to reconstruct high dynamic range (HDR) videos from events, but have either suffered from unrealistic artifacts or failed to provide sufficiently high frame rates. In this paper, we present a recurrent convolutional neural network that reconstruct high-speed HDR videos from event sequences, with a key frame guidance to prevent potential error accumulation caused by the sparse event data. Additionally, to address the problem of severely limited real dataset, we develop a new optical system to collect a real-world dataset with paired high-speed HDR videos and event streams, facilitating future research in this field. Our dataset provides the first real paired dataset for event-to-HDR reconstruction, avoiding potential inaccuracies from simulation strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate high-quality, high-speed HDR videos. We further explore the potential of our work in cross-camera reconstruction and downstream computer vision tasks, including object detection, panoramic segmentation, optical flow estimation, and monocular depth estimation under HDR scenarios.</description>

      <title>GeoBiked: A Dataset with Geometric Features and Automated Labeling Techniques to Enable Deep Generative Models in Engineering Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a dataset for enabling Deep Generative Models (DGMs) in engineering design and propose methods to automate data labeling by utilizing large-scale foundation models. GeoBiked is curated to contain 4 355 bicycle images, annotated with structural and technical features and is used to investigate two automated labeling techniques: The utilization of consolidated latent features (Hyperfeatures) from image-generation models to detect geometric correspondences (e.g. the position of the wheel center) in structural images and the generation of diverse text descriptions for structural images. GPT-4o, a vision-language-model (VLM), is instructed to analyze images and produce diverse descriptions aligned with the system-prompt. By representing technical images as Diffusion-Hyperfeatures, drawing geometric correspondences between them is possible. The detection accuracy of geometric points in unseen samples is improved by presenting multiple annotated source images. GPT-4o has sufficient capabilities to generate accurate descriptions of technical images. Grounding the generation only on images leads to diverse descriptions but causes hallucinations, while grounding it on categorical labels restricts the diversity. Using both as input balances creativity and accuracy. Successfully using Hyperfeatures for geometric correspondence suggests that this approach can be used for general point-detection and annotation tasks in technical images. Labeling such images with text descriptions using VLMs is possible, but dependent on the models detection capabilities, careful prompt-engineering and the selection of input information. Applying foundation models in engineering design is largely unexplored. We aim to bridge this gap with a dataset to explore training, finetuning and conditioning DGMs in this field and suggesting approaches to bootstrap foundation models to process technical images.</description>

      <title>ControlCity: A Multimodal Diffusion Model Based Approach for Accurate Geospatial Data Generation and Urban Morphology Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volunteer Geographic Information (VGI), with its rich variety, large volume, rapid updates, and diverse sources, has become a critical source of geospatial data. However, VGI data from platforms like OSM exhibit significant quality heterogeneity across different data types, particularly with urban building data. To address this, we propose a multi-source geographic data transformation solution, utilizing accessible and complete VGI data to assist in generating urban building footprint data. We also employ a multimodal data generation framework to improve accuracy. First, we introduce a pipeline for constructing an 'image-text-metadata-building footprint' dataset, primarily based on road network data and supplemented by other multimodal data. We then present ControlCity, a geographic data transformation method based on a multimodal diffusion model. This method first uses a pre-trained text-to-image model to align text, metadata, and building footprint data. An improved ControlNet further integrates road network and land-use imagery, producing refined building footprint data. Experiments across 22 global cities demonstrate that ControlCity successfully simulates real urban building patterns, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, our method achieves an average FID score of 50.94, reducing error by 71.01% compared to leading methods, and a MIoU score of 0.36, an improvement of 38.46%. Additionally, our model excels in tasks like urban morphology transfer, zero-shot city generation, and spatial data completeness assessment. In the zero-shot city task, our method accurately predicts and generates similar urban structures, demonstrating strong generalization. This study confirms the effectiveness of our approach in generating urban building footprint data and capturing complex city characteristics.</description>

      <title>Degradation-Guided One-Step Image Super-Resolution with Diffusion Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) methods have achieved remarkable success by leveraging large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models as priors. However, these methods still face two challenges: the requirement for dozens of sampling steps to achieve satisfactory results, which limits efficiency in real scenarios, and the neglect of degradation models, which are critical auxiliary information in solving the SR problem. In this work, we introduced a novel one-step SR model, which significantly addresses the efficiency issue of diffusion-based SR methods. Unlike existing fine-tuning strategies, we designed a degradation-guided Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module specifically for SR, which corrects the model parameters based on the pre-estimated degradation information from low-resolution images. This module not only facilitates a powerful data-dependent or degradation-dependent SR model but also preserves the generative prior of the pre-trained diffusion model as much as possible. Furthermore, we tailor a novel training pipeline by introducing an online negative sample generation strategy. Combined with the classifier-free guidance strategy during inference, it largely improves the perceptual quality of the super-resolution results. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superior efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models have shown immense promise in computational pathology (CPath) tasks, but their performance often suffers when applied to unseen data due to domain shifts. Addressing this requires domain generalization (DG) algorithms. However, a systematic evaluation of DG algorithms in the CPath context is lacking. This study aims to benchmark the effectiveness of 30 DG algorithms on 3 CPath tasks of varying difficulty through 7,560 cross-validation runs. We evaluate these algorithms using a unified and robust platform, incorporating modality-specific techniques and recent advances like pretrained foundation models. Our extensive cross-validation experiments provide insights into the relative performance of various DG strategies. We observe that self-supervised learning and stain augmentation consistently outperform other methods, highlighting the potential of pretrained models and data augmentation. Furthermore, we introduce a new pan-cancer tumor detection dataset (HISTOPANTUM) as a benchmark for future research. This study offers valuable guidance to researchers in selecting appropriate DG approaches for CPath tasks.</description>

      <title>Can Vision Language Models Learn from Visual Demonstrations of Ambiguous Spatial Reasoning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have become state-of-the-art for many computer vision tasks, with in-context learning (ICL) as a popular adaptation strategy for new ones. But can VLMs learn novel concepts purely from visual demonstrations, or are they limited to adapting to the output format of ICL examples? We propose a new benchmark we call Spatial Visual Ambiguity Tasks (SVAT) that challenges state-of-the-art VLMs to learn new visuospatial tasks in-context. We find that VLMs fail to do this zero-shot, and sometimes continue to fail after finetuning. However, adding simpler data to the training by curriculum learning leads to improved ICL performance.</description>

      <title>Parameter-efficient Bayesian Neural Networks for Uncertainty-aware Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art computer vision tasks, like monocular depth estimation (MDE), rely heavily on large, modern Transformer-based architectures. However, their application in safety-critical domains demands reliable predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. While Bayesian neural networks provide a conceptually simple approach to serve those requirements, they suffer from the high dimensionality of the parameter space. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, in particular low-rank adaptations (LoRA), have emerged as a popular strategy for adapting large-scale models to down-stream tasks by performing parameter inference on lower-dimensional subspaces. In this work, we investigate the suitability of PEFT methods for subspace Bayesian inference in large-scale Transformer-based vision models. We show that, indeed, combining BitFit, DiffFit, LoRA, and CoLoRA, a novel LoRA-inspired PEFT method, with Bayesian inference enables more robust and reliable predictive performance in MDE.</description>

      <title>Ctrl-GenAug: Controllable Generative Augmentation for Medical Sequence Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the medical field, the limited availability of large-scale datasets and labor-intensive annotation processes hinder the performance of deep models. Diffusion-based generative augmentation approaches present a promising solution to this issue, having been proven effective in advancing downstream medical recognition tasks. Nevertheless, existing works lack sufficient semantic and sequential steerability for challenging video/3D sequence generation, and neglect quality control of noisy synthesized samples, resulting in unreliable synthetic databases and severely limiting the performance of downstream tasks. In this work, we present Ctrl-GenAug, a novel and general generative augmentation framework that enables highly semantic- and sequential-customized sequence synthesis and suppresses incorrectly synthesized samples, to aid medical sequence classification. Specifically, we first design a multimodal conditions-guided sequence generator for controllably synthesizing diagnosis-promotive samples. A sequential augmentation module is integrated to enhance the temporal/stereoscopic coherence of generated samples. Then, we propose a noisy synthetic data filter to suppress unreliable cases at semantic and sequential levels. Extensive experiments on 3 medical datasets, using 11 networks trained on 3 paradigms, comprehensively analyze the effectiveness and generality of Ctrl-GenAug, particularly in underrepresented high-risk populations and out-domain conditions.</description>

      <title>BitQ: Tailoring Block Floating Point Precision for Improved DNN Efficiency on Resource-Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful for cognitive tasks such as image classification, object detection, and scene segmentation. One drawback however is the significant high computational complexity and memory consumption, which makes them unfeasible to run real-time on embedded platforms because of the limited hardware resources. Block floating point (BFP) quantization is one of the representative compression approaches for reducing the memory and computational burden owing to their capability to effectively capture the broad data distribution of DNN models. Unfortunately, prior works on BFP-based quantization empirically choose the block size and the precision that preserve accuracy. In this paper, we develop a BFP-based bitwidth-aware analytical modeling framework (called ``BitQ'') for the best BFP implementation of DNN inference on embedded platforms. We formulate and resolve an optimization problem to identify the optimal BFP block size and bitwidth distribution by the trade-off of both accuracy and performance loss. Experimental results show that compared with an equal bitwidth setting, the BFP DNNs with optimized bitwidth allocation provide efficient computation, preserving accuracy on famous benchmarks. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/Cheliosoops/BitQ.</description>

      <title>General Detection-based Text Line Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general detection-based approach to text line recognition, be it printed (OCR) or handwritten (HTR), with Latin, Chinese, or ciphered characters. Detection-based approaches have until now been largely discarded for HTR because reading characters separately is often challenging, and character-level annotation is difficult and expensive. We overcome these challenges thanks to three main insights: (i) synthetic pre-training with sufficiently diverse data enables learning reasonable character localization for any script; (ii) modern transformer-based detectors can jointly detect a large number of instances, and, if trained with an adequate masking strategy, leverage consistency between the different detections; (iii) once a pre-trained detection model with approximate character localization is available, it is possible to fine-tune it with line-level annotation on real data, even with a different alphabet. Our approach, dubbed DTLR, builds on a completely different paradigm than state-of-the-art HTR methods, which rely on autoregressive decoding, predicting character values one by one, while we treat a complete line in parallel. Remarkably, we demonstrate good performance on a large range of scripts, usually tackled with specialized approaches. In particular, we improve state-of-the-art performances for Chinese script recognition on the CASIA v2 dataset, and for cipher recognition on the Borg and Copiale datasets. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/raphael-baena/DTLR.</description>

      <title>Text2CAD: Generating Sequential CAD Models from Beginner-to-Expert Level Text Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prototyping complex computer-aided design (CAD) models in modern softwares can be very time-consuming. This is due to the lack of intelligent systems that can quickly generate simpler intermediate parts. We propose Text2CAD, the first AI framework for generating text-to-parametric CAD models using designer-friendly instructions for all skill levels. Furthermore, we introduce a data annotation pipeline for generating text prompts based on natural language instructions for the DeepCAD dataset using Mistral and LLaVA-NeXT. The dataset contains $\sim170$K models and $\sim660$K text annotations, from abstract CAD descriptions (e.g., generate two concentric cylinders) to detailed specifications (e.g., draw two circles with center $(x,y)$ and radius $r_{1}$, $r_{2}$, and extrude along the normal by $d$...). Within the Text2CAD framework, we propose an end-to-end transformer-based auto-regressive network to generate parametric CAD models from input texts. We evaluate the performance of our model through a mixture of metrics, including visual quality, parametric precision, and geometrical accuracy. Our proposed framework shows great potential in AI-aided design applications. Our source code and annotations will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Ontological Commitment in Multi-Modal Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ontological commitment, i.e., used concepts, relations, and assumptions, are a corner stone of qualitative reasoning (QR) models. The state-of-the-art for processing raw inputs, though, are deep neural networks (DNNs), nowadays often based off from multimodal foundation models. These automatically learn rich representations of concepts and respective reasoning. Unfortunately, the learned qualitative knowledge is opaque, preventing easy inspection, validation, or adaptation against available QR models. So far, it is possible to associate pre-defined concepts with latent representations of DNNs, but extractable relations are mostly limited to semantic similarity. As a next step towards QR for validation and verification of DNNs: Concretely, we propose a method that extracts the learned superclass hierarchy from a multimodal DNN for a given set of leaf concepts. Under the hood we (1) obtain leaf concept embeddings using the DNN's textual input modality; (2) apply hierarchical clustering to them, using that DNNs encode semantic similarities via vector distances; and (3) label the such-obtained parent concepts using search in available ontologies from QR. An initial evaluation study shows that meaningful ontological class hierarchies can be extracted from state-of-the-art foundation models. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to validate and verify a DNN's learned representations against given ontologies. Lastly, we discuss potential future applications in the context of QR.</description>

      <title>MorphoSeg: An Uncertainty-Aware Deep Learning Method for Biomedical Segmentation of Complex Cellular Morphologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical and biological imaging, particularly in segmentation tasks. However, segmenting biological cells remains challenging due to the high variability and complexity of cell shapes. Addressing this challenge requires high-quality datasets that accurately represent the diverse morphologies found in biological cells. Existing cell segmentation datasets are often limited by their focus on regular and uniform shapes. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset of Ntera-2 (NT2) cells, a pluripotent carcinoma cell line, exhibiting diverse morphologies across multiple stages of differentiation, capturing the intricate and heterogeneous cellular structures that complicate segmentation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware deep learning framework for complex cellular morphology segmentation (MorphoSeg) by incorporating sampling of virtual outliers from low-likelihood regions during training. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate that MorphoSeg significantly enhances segmentation accuracy, achieving up to a 7.74% increase in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and a 28.36% reduction in the Hausdorff Distance. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our dataset and methodology in advancing cell segmentation capabilities, especially for complex and variable cell morphologies. The dataset and source code is publicly available at https://github.com/RanchoGoose/MorphoSeg.</description>

      <title>Small data deep learning methodology for in-field disease detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection of diseases in crops is essential to prevent harvest losses and improve the quality of the final product. In this context, the combination of machine learning and proximity sensors is emerging as a technique capable of achieving this detection efficiently and effectively. For example, this machine learning approach has been applied to potato crops -- to detect late blight (Phytophthora infestans) -- and grapevine crops -- to detect downy mildew. However, most of these AI models found in the specialised literature have been developed using leaf-by-leaf images taken in the lab, which does not represent field conditions and limits their applicability.
  In this study, we present the first machine learning model capable of detecting mild symptoms of late blight in potato crops through the analysis of high-resolution RGB images captured directly in the field, overcoming the limitations of other publications in the literature and presenting real-world applicability. Our proposal exploits the availability of high-resolution images via the concept of patching, and is based on deep convolutional neural networks with a focal loss function, which makes the model to focus on the complex patterns that arise in field conditions. Additionally, we present a data augmentation scheme that facilitates the training of these neural networks with few high-resolution images, which allows for development of models under the small data paradigm.
  Our model correctly detects all cases of late blight in the test dataset, demonstrating a high level of accuracy and effectiveness in identifying early symptoms. These promising results reinforce the potential use of machine learning for the early detection of diseases and pests in agriculture, enabling better treatment and reducing their impact on crops.</description>

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are a novel paradigm for signal representation that have attracted considerable interest for image compression. INRs offer unprecedented advantages in signal resolution and memory efficiency, enabling new possibilities for compression techniques. However, the existing limitations of INRs for image compression have not been sufficiently addressed in the literature. In this work, we explore the critical yet overlooked limiting factors of INRs, such as computational cost, unstable performance, and robustness. Through extensive experiments and empirical analysis, we provide a deeper and more nuanced understanding of implicit neural image compression methods such as Fourier Feature Networks and Siren. Our work also offers valuable insights for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Attention Prompting on Image for Large Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared with Large Language Models (LLMs), Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can also accept images as input, thus showcasing more interesting emergent capabilities and demonstrating impressive performance on various vision-language tasks. Motivated by text prompting in LLMs, visual prompting has been explored to enhance LVLMs' capabilities of perceiving visual information. However, previous visual prompting techniques solely process visual inputs without considering text queries, limiting the models' ability to follow text instructions to complete tasks. To fill this gap, in this work, we propose a new prompting technique named Attention Prompting on Image, which just simply overlays a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original input image and effectively enhances LVLM on various tasks. Specifically, we generate an attention heatmap for the input image dependent on the text query with an auxiliary model like CLIP. Then the heatmap simply multiplies the pixel values of the original image to obtain the actual input image for the LVLM. Extensive experiments on various vison-language benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our technique. For example, Attention Prompting on Image improves LLaVA-1.5 by 3.8% and 2.9% on MM-Vet and LLaVA-Wild benchmarks, respectively.</description>

      <title>DreamWaltz-G: Expressive 3D Gaussian Avatars from Skeleton-Guided 2D Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging pretrained 2D diffusion models and score distillation sampling (SDS), recent methods have shown promising results for text-to-3D avatar generation. However, generating high-quality 3D avatars capable of expressive animation remains challenging. In this work, we present DreamWaltz-G, a novel learning framework for animatable 3D avatar generation from text. The core of this framework lies in Skeleton-guided Score Distillation and Hybrid 3D Gaussian Avatar representation. Specifically, the proposed skeleton-guided score distillation integrates skeleton controls from 3D human templates into 2D diffusion models, enhancing the consistency of SDS supervision in terms of view and human pose. This facilitates the generation of high-quality avatars, mitigating issues such as multiple faces, extra limbs, and blurring. The proposed hybrid 3D Gaussian avatar representation builds on the efficient 3D Gaussians, combining neural implicit fields and parameterized 3D meshes to enable real-time rendering, stable SDS optimization, and expressive animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamWaltz-G is highly effective in generating and animating 3D avatars, outperforming existing methods in both visual quality and animation expressiveness. Our framework further supports diverse applications, including human video reenactment and multi-subject scene composition.</description>

      <title>Molmo and PixMo: Open Weights and Open Data for State-of-the-Art Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today's most advanced multimodal models remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models rely heavily on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs to achieve good performance, effectively distilling these closed models into open ones. As a result, the community is still missing foundational knowledge about how to build performant VLMs from scratch. We present Molmo, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art in their class of openness. Our key innovation is a novel, highly detailed image caption dataset collected entirely from human annotators using speech-based descriptions. To enable a wide array of user interactions, we also introduce a diverse dataset mixture for fine-tuning that includes in-the-wild Q&amp;A and innovative 2D pointing data. The success of our approach relies on careful choices for the model architecture details, a well-tuned training pipeline, and, most critically, the quality of our newly collected datasets, all of which will be released. The best-in-class 72B model within the Molmo family not only outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models but also compares favorably against proprietary systems like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.5 on both academic benchmarks and human evaluation.
  We will be releasing all of our model weights, captioning and fine-tuning data, and source code in the near future. Select model weights, inference code, and demo are available at https://molmo.allenai.org.</description>

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the most major causes of death among women, after lung cancer. Breast cancer detection advancements can increase the survival rate of patients through earlier detection. Breast cancer that can be detected by using mammographic imaging is now considered crucial step for computer aided systems. Researchers have explained many techniques for the automatic detection of initial tumors. The early breast cancer symptoms include masses and micro-calcifications. Because there is the variation in the tumor shape, size and position it is difficult to extract abnormal region from normal tissues. So, machine learning can help medical professionals make more accurate diagnoses of the disease whereas deep learning or neural networks are one of the methods that can be used to distinguish regular and irregular breast identification. In this study the extraction method for the classification of breast masses as normal and abnormal we have used is convolutional neural network (CNN) on mammograms. DDSM dataset has been used in which nearly 460 images are of normal and 920 of abnormal breasts.</description>

Abstract: The damage detection problem becomes a more difficult task when the intrinsically nonlinear behavior of the structures and the natural data variation are considered in the analysis because both phenomena can be confused with damage if linear and deterministic approaches are implemented. Therefore, this work aims the experimental application of a stochastic version of the Volterra series combined with a novelty detection approach to detect damage in an initially nonlinear system taking into account the measured data variation, caused by the presence of uncertainties. The experimental setup is composed by a cantilever beam operating in a nonlinear regime of motion, even in the healthy condition, induced by the presence of a magnet near to the free extremity. The damage associated with mass changes in a bolted connection (nuts loosed) is detected based on the comparison between linear and nonlinear contributions of the stochastic Volterra kernels in the total response, estimated in the reference and damaged conditions. The experimental measurements were performed on different days to add natural variation to the data measured. The results obtained through the stochastic proposed approach are compared with those obtained by the deterministic version of the Volterra series, showing the advantage of the stochastic model use when we consider the experimental data variation with the capability to detect the presence of the damage with statistical confidence. Besides, the nonlinear metric used presented a higher sensitivity to the occurrence of the damage compared with the linear one, justifying the application of a nonlinear metric when the system exhibits intrinsically nonlinear behavior.</description>

      <title>Developing a Thailand solar irradiance map using Himawari-8 satellite imageries and deep learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an online platform that shows Thailand's solar irradiance map every 30 minutes. It is available at https://www.cusolarforecast.com. The methodology for estimating global horizontal irradiance (GHI) across Thailand relies on cloud index extracted from Himawari-8 satellite imagery, Ineichen clear-sky model with locally-tuned Linke turbidity, and machine learning models. The methods take clear-sky irradiance, cloud index, re-analyzed GHI and temperature data from the MERRA-2 database, and date-time as inputs for GHI estimation models, including LightGBM, LSTM, Informer, and Transformer. These are benchmarked with the estimate from the SolCast service by evaluation of 15-minute ground GHI data from 53 ground stations over 1.5 years during 2022-2023. The results show that the four models have competitive performances and outperform the SolCast service. The best model is LightGBM, with an MAE of 78.58 W/sqm and RMSE of 118.97 W/sqm. Obtaining re-analyzed MERRA-2 data for Thailand is not economically feasible for deployment. When removing these features, the Informer model has a winning performance of 78.67 W/sqm in MAE. The obtained performance aligns with existing literature by taking the climate zone and time granularity of data into consideration. As the map shows an estimate of GHI over 93,000 grids with a frequent update, the paper also describes a computational framework for displaying the entire map. It tests the runtime performance of deep learning models in the GHI estimation process.</description>

      <title>MRI Radiomics for IDH Genotype Prediction in Glioblastoma Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiomics is a relatively new field which utilises automatically identified features from radiological scans. It has found a widespread application, particularly in oncology because many of the important oncological biomarkers are not visible to the naked eye. The recent advent of big data, including in medical imaging, and the development of new ML techniques brought the possibility of faster and more accurate oncological diagnosis. Furthermore, standardised mathematical feature extraction based on radiomics helps to eliminate possible radiologist bias. This paper reviews the recent development in the oncological use of MRI radiomic features. It focuses on the identification of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status, which is an important biomarker for the diagnosis of glioblastoma and grade IV astrocytoma.</description>

      <title>Predicting Distance matrix with large language models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural prediction has long been considered critical in RNA research, especially following the success of AlphaFold2 in protein studies, which has drawn significant attention to the field. While recent advances in machine learning and data accumulation have effectively addressed many biological tasks, particularly in protein related research. RNA structure prediction remains a significant challenge due to data limitations. Obtaining RNA structural data is difficult because traditional methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Xray crystallography, and electron microscopy are expensive and time consuming. Although several RNA 3D structure prediction methods have been proposed, their accuracy is still limited. Predicting RNA structural information at another level, such as distance maps, remains highly valuable. Distance maps provide a simplified representation of spatial constraints between nucleotides, capturing essential relationships without requiring a full 3D model. This intermediate level of structural information can guide more accurate 3D modeling and is computationally less intensive, making it a useful tool for improving structural predictions. In this work, we demonstrate that using only primary sequence information, we can accurately infer the distances between RNA bases by utilizing a large pretrained RNA language model coupled with a well trained downstream transformer.</description>

      <title>Future-Proofing Medical Imaging with Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning and Uncertainty Quantification: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in automating various medical imaging tasks, which could soon become routine in clinical practice for disease diagnosis, prognosis, treatment planning, and post-treatment surveillance. However, the privacy concerns surrounding patient data present a major barrier to the widespread adoption of AI in medical imaging, as large, diverse training datasets are essential for developing accurate, generalizable, and robust Artificial intelligence models. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution that enables organizations to train AI models collaboratively without sharing sensitive data. federated learning exchanges model training information, such as gradients, between the participating sites. Despite its promise, federated learning is still in its developmental stages and faces several challenges. Notably, sensitive information can still be inferred from the gradients shared during model training. Quantifying AI models' uncertainty is vital due to potential data distribution shifts post-deployment, which can affect model performance. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in FL is particularly challenging due to data heterogeneity across participating sites. This review provides a comprehensive examination of FL, privacy-preserving FL (PPFL), and UQ in FL. We identify key gaps in current FL methodologies and propose future research directions to enhance data privacy and trustworthiness in medical imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Patch-Based Contrastive Learning and Memory Consolidation for Online Unsupervised Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on a relatively unexplored learning paradigm known as {\em Online Unsupervised Continual Learning} (O-UCL), where an agent receives a non-stationary, unlabeled data stream and progressively learns to identify an increasing number of classes. This paradigm is designed to model real-world applications where encountering novelty is the norm, such as exploring a terrain with several unknown and time-varying entities. Unlike prior work in unsupervised, continual, or online learning, O-UCL combines all three areas into a single challenging and realistic learning paradigm. In this setting, agents are frequently evaluated and must aim to maintain the best possible representation at any point of the data stream, rather than at the end of pre-specified offline tasks. The proposed approach, called \textbf{P}atch-based \textbf{C}ontrastive learning and \textbf{M}emory \textbf{C}onsolidation (PCMC), builds a compositional understanding of data by identifying and clustering patch-level features. Embeddings for these patch-level features are extracted with an encoder trained via patch-based contrastive learning. PCMC incorporates new data into its distribution while avoiding catastrophic forgetting, and it consolidates memory examples during ``sleep" periods. We evaluate PCMC's performance on streams created from the ImageNet and Places365 datasets. Additionally, we explore various versions of the PCMC algorithm and compare its performance against several existing methods and simple baselines.</description>

      <title>Modern Hopfield Networks meet Encoded Neural Representations -- Addressing Practical Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Content-addressable memories such as Modern Hopfield Networks (MHN) have been studied as mathematical models of auto-association and storage/retrieval in the human declarative memory, yet their practical use for large-scale content storage faces challenges. Chief among them is the occurrence of meta-stable states, particularly when handling large amounts of high dimensional content. This paper introduces Hopfield Encoding Networks (HEN), a framework that integrates encoded neural representations into MHNs to improve pattern separability and reduce meta-stable states. We show that HEN can also be used for retrieval in the context of hetero association of images with natural language queries, thus removing the limitation of requiring access to partial content in the same domain. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reduction in meta-stable states and increased storage capacity while still enabling perfect recall of a significantly larger number of inputs advancing the practical utility of associative memory networks for real-world tasks.</description>

      <title>Vision-based Xylem Wetness Classification in Stem Water Potential Determination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water is often overused in irrigation, making efficient management of it crucial. Precision Agriculture emphasizes tools like stem water potential (SWP) analysis for better plant status determination. However, such tools often require labor-intensive in-situ sampling. Automation and machine learning can streamline this process and enhance outcomes. This work focused on automating stem detection and xylem wetness classification using the Scholander Pressure Chamber, a widely used but demanding method for SWP measurement. The aim was to refine stem detection and develop computer-vision-based methods to better classify water emergence at the xylem. To this end, we collected and manually annotated video data, applying vision- and learning-based methods for detection and classification. Additionally, we explored data augmentation and fine-tuned parameters to identify the most effective models. The identified best-performing models for stem detection and xylem wetness classification were evaluated end-to-end over 20 SWP measurements. Learning-based stem detection via YOLOv8n combined with ResNet50-based classification achieved a Top-1 accuracy of 80.98%, making it the best-performing approach for xylem wetness classification.</description>

      <title>Lessons Learned from a Unifying Empirical Study of Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) in Visual Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) has attracted significant attention lately, due to the increasing size of pre-trained models and the need to fine-tune (FT) them for superior downstream performance. This community-wide enthusiasm has sparked a plethora of new methods. Nevertheless, a systematic study to understand their performance and suitable application scenarios is lacking, leaving questions like when to apply PETL and which method to use largely unanswered. In this paper, we conduct a unifying empirical study of representative PETL methods in the context of Vision Transformers. We systematically tune their hyper-parameters to fairly compare their accuracy on downstream tasks. Our study not only offers a valuable user guide but also unveils several new insights. First, if tuned carefully, different PETL methods can obtain quite similar accuracy in the low-shot benchmark VTAB-1K. This includes simple methods like FT the bias terms that were reported inferior. Second, though with similar accuracy, we find that PETL methods make different mistakes and high-confidence predictions, likely due to their different inductive biases. Such an inconsistency (or complementariness) opens up the opportunity for ensemble methods, and we make preliminary attempts at this. Third, going beyond the commonly used low-shot tasks, we find that PETL is also useful in many-shot regimes -- it achieves comparable and sometimes better accuracy than full FT, using much fewer learnable parameters. Last but not least, we investigate PETL's ability to preserve a pre-trained model's robustness to distribution shifts (e.g., a CLIP backbone). Perhaps not surprisingly, PETL methods outperform full FT alone. However, with weight-space ensembles, the fully FT model can achieve a better balance between downstream and out-of-distribution performance, suggesting a future research direction for PETL.</description>

      <title>A novel open-source ultrasound dataset with deep learning benchmarks for spinal cord injury localization and anatomical segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While deep learning has catalyzed breakthroughs across numerous domains, its broader adoption in clinical settings is inhibited by the costly and time-intensive nature of data acquisition and annotation. To further facilitate medical machine learning, we present an ultrasound dataset of 10,223 Brightness-mode (B-mode) images consisting of sagittal slices of porcine spinal cords (N=25) before and after a contusion injury. We additionally benchmark the performance metrics of several state-of-the-art object detection algorithms to localize the site of injury and semantic segmentation models to label the anatomy for comparison and creation of task-specific architectures. Finally, we evaluate the zero-shot generalization capabilities of the segmentation models on human ultrasound spinal cord images to determine whether training on our porcine dataset is sufficient for accurately interpreting human data. Our results show that the YOLOv8 detection model outperforms all evaluated models for injury localization, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP50-95) score of 0.606. Segmentation metrics indicate that the DeepLabv3 segmentation model achieves the highest accuracy on unseen porcine anatomy, with a Mean Dice score of 0.587, while SAMed achieves the highest Mean Dice score generalizing to human anatomy (0.445). To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest annotated dataset of spinal cord ultrasound images made publicly available to researchers and medical professionals, as well as the first public report of object detection and segmentation architectures to assess anatomical markers in the spinal cord for methodology development and clinical applications.</description>

Abstract: We propose a standalone monocular visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) initialization pipeline for autonomous robots in space. Our method, a state-of-the-art factor graph optimization pipeline, enhances classical Structure from Small Motion (SfSM) to robustly initialize a monocular agent in weak-perspective projection scenes. Furthermore, it overcomes visual estimation challenges introduced by spacecraft inspection trajectories, such as: center-pointing motion, which exacerbates the bas-relief ambiguity, and the presence of a dominant plane in the scene, which causes motion estimation degeneracies in classical Structure from Motion (SfM). We validate our method on realistic, simulated satellite inspection images exhibiting weak-perspective projection, and we demonstrate its effectiveness and improved performance compared to other monocular initialization procedures.</description>

      <title>FLaRe: Achieving Masterful and Adaptive Robot Policies with Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the Robotics field has initiated several efforts toward building generalist robot policies through large-scale multi-task Behavior Cloning. However, direct deployments of these policies have led to unsatisfactory performance, where the policy struggles with unseen states and tasks. How can we break through the performance plateau of these models and elevate their capabilities to new heights? In this paper, we propose FLaRe, a large-scale Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning framework that integrates robust pre-trained representations, large-scale training, and gradient stabilization techniques. Our method aligns pre-trained policies towards task completion, achieving state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance both on previously demonstrated and on entirely novel tasks and embodiments. Specifically, on a set of long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks, FLaRe achieves an average success rate of 79.5% in unseen environments, with absolute improvements of +23.6% in simulation and +30.7% on real robots over prior SoTA methods. By utilizing only sparse rewards, our approach can enable generalizing to new capabilities beyond the pretraining data with minimal human effort. Moreover, we demonstrate rapid adaptation to new embodiments and behaviors with less than a day of fine-tuning.

      <title>Stochastic Subsampling With Average Pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regularization of deep neural networks has been an important issue to achieve higher generalization performance without overfitting problems. Although the popular method of Dropout provides a regularization effect, it causes inconsistent properties in the output, which may degrade the performance of deep neural networks. In this study, we propose a new module called stochastic average pooling, which incorporates Dropout-like stochasticity in pooling. We describe the properties of stochastic subsampling and average pooling and leverage them to design a module without any inconsistency problem. The stochastic average pooling achieves a regularization effect without any potential performance degradation due to the inconsistency issue and can easily be plugged into existing architectures of deep neural networks. Experiments demonstrate that replacing existing average pooling with stochastic average pooling yields consistent improvements across a variety of tasks, datasets, and models.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning Recognition of Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy: Quantifying and Mitigating the Influence of Gaussian Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is a powerful tool to reveal the morphologies and structures of materials, thereby attracting intensive interests from the scientific and industrial communities. The outstanding spatial (atomic level) and temporal (ms level) resolutions of the STEM techniques generate fruitful amounts of high-definition data, thereby enabling the high-volume and high-speed analysis of materials. On the other hand, processing of the big dataset generated by STEM is time-consuming and beyond the capability of human-based manual work, which urgently calls for computer-based automation. In this work, we present a deep-learning mask region-based neural network (Mask R-CNN) for the recognition of nanoparticles imaged by STEM, as well as generating the associated dimensional analysis. The Mask R-CNN model was tested on simulated STEM-HAADF results with different Gaussian noises, particle shapes and particle sizes, and the results indicated that Gaussian noise has determining influence on the accuracy of recognition. By applying Gaussian and Non-Local Means filters on the noise-containing STEM-HAADF results, the influences of noises are largely mitigated, and recognition accuracy is significantly improved. This filtering-recognition approach was further applied to experimental STEM-HAADF results, which yields satisfying accuracy compared with the traditional threshold methods. The deep-learning-based method developed in this work has great potentials in analysis of the complicated structures and large data generated by STEM-HAADF.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Covariate Shift in Imitation Learning for Autonomous Vehicles Using Latent Space Generative World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of latent space generative world models to address the covariate shift problem in autonomous driving. A world model is a neural network capable of predicting an agent's next state given past states and actions. By leveraging a world model during training, the driving policy effectively mitigates covariate shift without requiring an excessive amount of training data. During end-to-end training, our policy learns how to recover from errors by aligning with states observed in human demonstrations, so that at runtime it can recover from perturbations outside the training distribution. Additionally, we introduce a novel transformer-based perception encoder that employs multi-view cross-attention and a learned scene query. We present qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrating significant improvements upon prior state of the art in closed-loop testing in the CARLA simulator, as well as showing the ability to handle perturbations in both CARLA and NVIDIA's DRIVE Sim.</description>

      <title>TSBP: Improving Object Detection in Histology Images via Test-time Self-guided Bounding-box Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A global threshold (e.g., 0.5) is often applied to determine which bounding boxes should be included in the final results for an object detection task. A higher threshold reduces false positives but may result in missing a significant portion of true positives. A lower threshold can increase detection recall but may also result in more false positives. Because of this, using a preset global threshold (e.g., 0.5) applied to all the bounding box candidates may lead to suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a Test-time Self-guided Bounding-box Propagation (TSBP) method, leveraging Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to enhance object detection in histology images. TSBP utilizes bounding boxes with high confidence to influence those with low confidence, leveraging visual similarities between them. This propagation mechanism enables bounding boxes to be selected in a controllable, explainable, and robust manner, which surpasses the effectiveness of using simple thresholds and uncertainty calibration methods. Importantly, TSBP does not necessitate additional labeled samples for model training or parameter estimation, unlike calibration methods. We conduct experiments on gland detection and cell detection tasks in histology images. The results show that our proposed TSBP significantly improves detection outcomes when working in conjunction with state-of-the-art deep learning-based detection networks. Compared to other methods such as uncertainty calibration, TSBP yields more robust and accurate object detection predictions while using no additional labeled samples.

      <title>3DDX: Bone Surface Reconstruction from a Single Standard-Geometry Radiograph via Dual-Face Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiography is widely used in orthopedics for its affordability and low radiation exposure. 3D reconstruction from a single radiograph, so-called 2D-3D reconstruction, offers the possibility of various clinical applications, but achieving clinically viable accuracy and computational efficiency is still an unsolved challenge. Unlike other areas in computer vision, X-ray imaging's unique properties, such as ray penetration and fixed geometry, have not been fully exploited. We propose a novel approach that simultaneously learns multiple depth maps (front- and back-surface of multiple bones) derived from the X-ray image to computed tomography registration. The proposed method not only leverages the fixed geometry characteristic of X-ray imaging but also enhances the precision of the reconstruction of the whole surface. Our study involved 600 CT and 2651 X-ray images (4 to 5 posed X-ray images per patient), demonstrating our method's superiority over traditional approaches with a surface reconstruction error reduction from 4.78 mm to 1.96 mm. This significant accuracy improvement and enhanced computational efficiency suggest our approach's potential for clinical application.</description>

      <title>SDCL: Students Discrepancy-Informed Correction Learning for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) has been demonstrated the potential to mitigate the issue of limited medical labeled data. However, confirmation and cognitive biases may affect the prevalent teacher-student based SSMIS methods due to erroneous pseudo-labels. To tackle this challenge, we improve the mean teacher approach and propose the Students Discrepancy-Informed Correction Learning (SDCL) framework that includes two students and one non-trainable teacher, which utilizes the segmentation difference between the two students to guide the self-correcting learning. The essence of SDCL is to identify the areas of segmentation discrepancy as the potential bias areas, and then encourage the model to review the correct cognition and rectify their own biases in these areas. To facilitate the bias correction learning with continuous review and rectification, two correction loss functions are employed to minimize the correct segmentation voxel distance and maximize the erroneous segmentation voxel entropy. We conducted experiments on three public medical image datasets: two 3D datasets (CT and MRI) and one 2D dataset (MRI). The results show that our SDCL surpasses the current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) methods by 2.57\%, 3.04\%, and 2.34\% in the Dice score on the Pancreas, LA, and ACDC datasets, respectively. In addition, the accuracy of our method is very close to the fully supervised method on the ACDC dataset, and even exceeds the fully supervised method on the Pancreas and LA dataset.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has gained great attention from researchers due to the popularity of mobile devices and the need to observe users' daily activity data for better human-computer interaction. In this work, we collect a human activity recognition dataset called OPPOHAR consisting of phone IMU data. To facilitate the employment of HAR system in mobile phone and to achieve user-specific activity recognition, we propose a novel light-weight network called Non-stationary BERT with a two-stage training method. We also propose a simple yet effective data augmentation method to explore the deeper relationship between the accelerator and gyroscope data from the IMU. The network achieves the state-of-the-art performance testing on various activity recognition datasets and the data augmentation method demonstrates its wide applicability.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Lossy Compression on 3D Medical Images Segmentation with Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image compression is a critical tool in decreasing the cost of storage and improving the speed of transmission over the internet. While deep learning applications for natural images widely adopts the usage of lossy compression techniques, it is not widespread for 3D medical images. Using three CT datasets (17 tasks) and one MRI dataset (3 tasks) we demonstrate that lossy compression up to 20 times have no negative impact on segmentation quality with deep neural networks (DNN). In addition, we demonstrate the ability of DNN models trained on compressed data to predict on uncompressed data and vice versa with no quality deterioration.</description>

      <title>Let There Be Light: Robust Lensless Imaging Under External Illumination With Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lensless cameras relax the design constraints of traditional cameras by shifting image formation from analog optics to digital post-processing. While new camera designs and applications can be enabled, lensless imaging is very sensitive to unwanted interference (other sources, noise, etc.). In this work, we address a prevalent noise source that has not been studied for lensless imaging: external illumination e.g. from ambient and direct lighting. Being robust to a variety of lighting conditions would increase the practicality and adoption of lensless imaging. To this end, we propose multiple recovery approaches that account for external illumination by incorporating its estimate into the image recovery process. At the core is a physics-based reconstruction that combines learnable image recovery and denoisers, all of whose parameters are trained using experimentally gathered data. Compared to standard reconstruction methods, our approach yields significant qualitative and quantitative improvements. We open-source our implementations and a 25K dataset of measurements under multiple lighting conditions.</description>

      <title>Scalable Ensemble Diversification for OOD Generalization and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training a diverse ensemble of models has several practical applications such as providing candidates for model selection with better out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and enabling the detection of OOD samples via Bayesian principles. An existing approach to diverse ensemble training encourages the models to disagree on provided OOD samples. However, the approach is computationally expensive and it requires well-separated ID and OOD examples, such that it has only been demonstrated in small-scale settings.
  $\textbf{Method.}$ This work presents a method for Scalable Ensemble Diversification (SED) applicable to large-scale settings (e.g. ImageNet) that does not require OOD samples. Instead, SED identifies hard training samples on the fly and encourages the ensemble members to disagree on these. To improve scaling, we show how to avoid the expensive computations in existing methods of exhaustive pairwise disagreements across models.
  $\textbf{Results.}$ We evaluate the benefits of diversification with experiments on ImageNet. First, for OOD generalization, we observe large benefits from the diversification in multiple settings including output-space (classical) ensembles and weight-space ensembles (model soups). Second, for OOD detection, we turn the diversity of ensemble hypotheses into a novel uncertainty score estimator that surpasses a large number of OOD detection baselines.

      <description>arXiv:2409.16810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an integrated approach to Visual SLAM, merging online sequential photometric calibration within a Hybrid direct-indirect visual SLAM (H-SLAM). Photometric calibration helps normalize pixel intensity values under different lighting conditions, and thereby improves the direct component of our H-SLAM. A tangential benefit also results to the indirect component of H-SLAM given that the detected features are more stable across variable lighting conditions. Our proposed photometrically calibrated H-SLAM is tested on several datasets, including the TUM monoVO as well as on a dataset we created. Calibrated H-SLAM outperforms other state of the art direct, indirect, and hybrid Visual SLAM systems in all the experiments. Furthermore, in online SLAM tested at our site, it also significantly outperformed the other SLAM Systems.</description>

      <title>Towards General Text-guided Image Synthesis for Customized Multimodal Brain MRI Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is indispensable in neuroscience and neurology. However, due to the accessibility of MRI scanners and their lengthy acquisition time, multimodal MR images are not commonly available. Current MR image synthesis approaches are typically trained on independent datasets for specific tasks, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to novel datasets and tasks. Here, we present TUMSyn, a Text-guided Universal MR image Synthesis generalist model, which can flexibly generate brain MR images with demanded imaging metadata from routinely acquired scans guided by text prompts. To ensure TUMSyn's image synthesis precision, versatility, and generalizability, we first construct a brain MR database comprising 31,407 3D images with 7 MRI modalities from 13 centers. We then pre-train an MRI-specific text encoder using contrastive learning to effectively control MR image synthesis based on text prompts. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and physician assessments indicate that TUMSyn can generate clinically meaningful MR images with specified imaging metadata in supervised and zero-shot scenarios. Therefore, TUMSyn can be utilized along with acquired MR scan(s) to facilitate large-scale MRI-based screening and diagnosis of brain diseases.</description>

      <title>Moner: Motion Correction in Undersampled Radial MRI with Unsupervised Neural Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion correction (MoCo) in radial MRI is a challenging problem due to the unpredictability of subject's motion. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MoCo algorithms often use extensive high-quality MR images to pre-train neural networks, obtaining excellent reconstructions. However, the need for large-scale datasets significantly increases costs and limits model generalization. In this work, we propose Moner, an unsupervised MoCo method that jointly solves artifact-free MR images and accurate motion from undersampled, rigid motion-corrupted k-space data, without requiring training data. Our core idea is to leverage the continuous prior of implicit neural representation (INR) to constrain this ill-posed inverse problem, enabling ideal solutions. Specifically, we incorporate a quasi-static motion model into the INR, granting its ability to correct subject's motion. To stabilize model optimization, we reformulate radial MRI as a back-projection problem using the Fourier-slice theorem. Additionally, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine hash encoding strategy, significantly enhancing MoCo accuracy. Experiments on multiple MRI datasets show our Moner achieves performance comparable to SOTA MoCo techniques on in-domain data, while demonstrating significant improvements on out-of-domain data.</description>

      <title>Going Beyond U-Net: Assessing Vision Transformers for Semantic Segmentation in Microscopy Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Segmentation is a crucial step in microscopy image analysis. Numerous approaches have been developed over the past years, ranging from classical segmentation algorithms to advanced deep learning models. While U-Net remains one of the most popular and well-established models for biomedical segmentation tasks, recently developed transformer-based models promise to enhance the segmentation process of microscopy images. In this work, we assess the efficacy of transformers, including UNETR, the Segment Anything Model, and Swin-UPerNet, and compare them with the well-established U-Net model across various image modalities such as electron microscopy, brightfield, histopathology, and phase-contrast. Our evaluation identifies several limitations in the original Swin Transformer model, which we address through architectural modifications to optimise its performance. The results demonstrate that these modifications improve segmentation performance compared to the classical U-Net model and the unmodified Swin-UPerNet. This comparative analysis highlights the promise of transformer models for advancing biomedical image segmentation. It demonstrates that their efficiency and applicability can be improved with careful modifications, facilitating their future use in microscopy image analysis tools.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Go-SLAM, a novel framework that utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM to reconstruct dynamic environments while embedding object-level information within the scene representations. This framework employs advanced object segmentation techniques, assigning a unique identifier to each Gaussian splat that corresponds to the object it represents. Consequently, our system facilitates open-vocabulary querying, allowing users to locate objects using natural language descriptions. Furthermore, the framework features an optimal path generation module that calculates efficient navigation paths for robots toward queried objects, considering obstacles and environmental uncertainties. Comprehensive evaluations in various scene settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in delivering high-fidelity scene reconstructions, precise object segmentation, flexible object querying, and efficient robot path planning. This work represents an additional step forward in bridging the gap between 3D scene reconstruction, semantic object understanding, and real-time environment interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous robots are being employed in several mapping and data collection tasks due to their efficiency and low labor costs. In these tasks, the robots are required to map targets-of-interest in an unknown environment while constrained to a given resource budget such as path length or mission time. This is a challenging problem as each robot has to not only detect and avoid collisions from static obstacles in the environment but also has to model other robots' trajectories to avoid inter-robot collisions. We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach for multi-robot informative path planning to map targets-of-interest in an unknown 3D environment. A key aspect of our approach is an augmented graph that models other robots' trajectories to enable planning for communication and inter-robot collision avoidance. We train our decentralized reinforcement learning policy via the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. Once trained, our policy is also scalable to varying number of robots and does not require re-training. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art multi-robot target mapping approaches by 33.75% in terms of the number of discovered targets-of-interest.

      <title>PitRSDNet: Predicting Intra-operative Remaining Surgery Duration in Endoscopic Pituitary Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate intra-operative Remaining Surgery Duration (RSD) predictions allow for anaesthetists to more accurately decide when to administer anaesthetic agents and drugs, as well as to notify hospital staff to send in the next patient. Therefore RSD plays an important role in improving patient care and minimising surgical theatre costs via efficient scheduling. In endoscopic pituitary surgery, it is uniquely challenging due to variable workflow sequences with a selection of optional steps contributing to high variability in surgery duration. This paper presents PitRSDNet for predicting RSD during pituitary surgery, a spatio-temporal neural network model that learns from historical data focusing on workflow sequences. PitRSDNet integrates workflow knowledge into RSD prediction in two forms: 1) multi-task learning for concurrently predicting step and RSD; and 2) incorporating prior steps as context in temporal learning and inference. PitRSDNet is trained and evaluated on a new endoscopic pituitary surgery dataset with 88 videos to show competitive performance improvements over previous statistical and machine learning methods. The findings also highlight how PitRSDNet improve RSD precision on outlier cases utilising the knowledge of prior steps.</description>

      <title>WasteGAN: Data Augmentation for Robotic Waste Sorting through Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic waste sorting poses significant challenges in both perception and manipulation, given the extreme variability of objects that should be recognized on a cluttered conveyor belt. While deep learning has proven effective in solving complex tasks, the necessity for extensive data collection and labeling limits its applicability in real-world scenarios like waste sorting. To tackle this issue, we introduce a data augmentation method based on a novel GAN architecture called wasteGAN. The proposed method allows to increase the performance of semantic segmentation models, starting from a very limited bunch of labeled examples, such as few as 100. The key innovations of wasteGAN include a novel loss function, a novel activation function, and a larger generator block. Overall, such innovations helps the network to learn from limited number of examples and synthesize data that better mirrors real-world distributions. We then leverage the higher-quality segmentation masks predicted from models trained on the wasteGAN synthetic data to compute semantic-aware grasp poses, enabling a robotic arm to effectively recognizing contaminants and separating waste in a real-world scenario. Through comprehensive evaluation encompassing dataset-based assessments and real-world experiments, our methodology demonstrated promising potential for robotic waste sorting, yielding performance gains of up to 5.8\% in picking contaminants.

      <title>Automated Surgical Skill Assessment in Endoscopic Pituitary Surgery using Real-time Instrument Tracking on a High-fidelity Bench-top Phantom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improved surgical skill is generally associated with improved patient outcomes, although assessment is subjective; labour-intensive; and requires domain specific expertise. Automated data driven metrics can alleviate these difficulties, as demonstrated by existing machine learning instrument tracking models in minimally invasive surgery. However, these models have been tested on limited datasets of laparoscopic surgery, with a focus on isolated tasks and robotic surgery. In this paper, a new public dataset is introduced, focusing on simulated surgery, using the nasal phase of endoscopic pituitary surgery as an exemplar. Simulated surgery allows for a realistic yet repeatable environment, meaning the insights gained from automated assessment can be used by novice surgeons to hone their skills on the simulator before moving to real surgery. PRINTNet (Pituitary Real-time INstrument Tracking Network) has been created as a baseline model for this automated assessment. Consisting of DeepLabV3 for classification and segmentation; StrongSORT for tracking; and the NVIDIA Holoscan SDK for real-time performance, PRINTNet achieved 71.9% Multiple Object Tracking Precision running at 22 Frames Per Second. Using this tracking output, a Multilayer Perceptron achieved 87% accuracy in predicting surgical skill level (novice or expert), with the "ratio of total procedure time to instrument visible time" correlated with higher surgical skill. This therefore demonstrates the feasibility of automated surgical skill assessment in simulated endoscopic pituitary surgery. The new publicly available dataset can be found here: https://doi.org/10.5522/04/26511049.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Perceptual Metrics on Music Representation Learning for Genre Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The subjective quality of natural signals can be approximated with objective perceptual metrics. Designed to approximate the perceptual behaviour of human observers, perceptual metrics often reflect structures found in natural signals and neurological pathways. Models trained with perceptual metrics as loss functions can capture perceptually meaningful features from the structures held within these metrics. We demonstrate that using features extracted from autoencoders trained with perceptual losses can improve performance on music understanding tasks, i.e. genre classification, over using these metrics directly as distances when learning a classifier. This result suggests improved generalisation to novel signals when using perceptual metrics as loss functions for representation learning.</description>

      <title>Classification of Gleason Grading in Prostate Cancer Histopathology Images Using Deep Learning Techniques: YOLO, Vision Transformers, and Vision Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prostate cancer ranks among the leading health issues impacting men, with the Gleason scoring system serving as the primary method for diagnosis and prognosis. This system relies on expert pathologists to evaluate samples of prostate tissue and assign a Gleason grade, a task that requires significant time and manual effort. To address this challenge, artificial intelligence (AI) solutions have been explored to automate the grading process. In light of these challenges, this study evaluates and compares the effectiveness of three deep learning methodologies, YOLO, Vision Transformers, and Vision Mamba, in accurately classifying Gleason grades from histopathology images. The goal is to enhance diagnostic precision and efficiency in prostate cancer management. This study utilized two publicly available datasets, Gleason2019 and SICAPv2, to train and test the performance of YOLO, Vision Transformers, and Vision Mamba models. Each model was assessed based on its ability to classify Gleason grades accurately, considering metrics such as false positive rate, false negative rate, precision, and recall. The study also examined the computational efficiency and applicability of each method in a clinical setting. Vision Mamba demonstrated superior performance across all metrics, achieving high precision and recall rates while minimizing false positives and negatives. YOLO showed promise in terms of speed and efficiency, particularly beneficial for real-time analysis. Vision Transformers excelled in capturing long-range dependencies within images, although they presented higher computational complexity compared to the other models. Vision Mamba emerges as the most effective model for Gleason grade classification in histopathology images, offering a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>PACE: marrying generalization in PArameter-efficient fine-tuning with Consistency rEgularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) effectively adapts pre-trained vision transformers to downstream tasks. However, the optimization for tasks performance often comes at the cost of generalizability in fine-tuned models. To address this issue, we theoretically connect smaller weight gradient norms during training and larger datasets to the improved model generalization. Motivated by this connection, we propose reducing gradient norms for enhanced generalization and aligning fine-tuned model with the pre-trained counterpart to retain knowledge from large-scale pre-training data. Yet, naive alignment does not guarantee gradient reduction and can potentially cause gradient explosion, complicating efforts to manage gradients. To address such issues, we propose PACE, marrying generalization of PArameter-efficient fine-tuning with Consistency rEgularization. We perturb features learned from the adapter with the multiplicative noise and ensure the fine-tuned model remains consistent for same sample under different perturbations. Theoretical analysis shows that PACE not only implicitly regularizes gradients for enhanced generalization, but also implicitly aligns the fine-tuned and pre-trained models to retain knowledge. Experimental evidence supports our theories. PACE outperforms existing PEFT methods in four visual adaptation tasks: VTAB-1k, FGVC, few-shot learning and domain adaptation.

      <title>Improving Clinician Performance in Classification of EEG Patterns on the Ictal-Interictal-Injury Continuum using Interpretable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05207v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In intensive care units (ICUs), critically ill patients are monitored with electroencephalograms (EEGs) to prevent serious brain injury. The number of patients who can be monitored is constrained by the availability of trained physicians to read EEGs, and EEG interpretation can be subjective and prone to inter-observer variability. Automated deep learning systems for EEG could reduce human bias and accelerate the diagnostic process. However, black box deep learning models are untrustworthy, difficult to troubleshoot, and lack accountability in real-world applications, leading to a lack of trust and adoption by clinicians. To address these challenges, we propose a novel interpretable deep learning model that not only predicts the presence of harmful brainwave patterns but also provides high-quality case-based explanations of its decisions. Our model performs better than the corresponding black box model, despite being constrained to be interpretable. The learned 2D embedded space provides the first global overview of the structure of ictal-interictal-injury continuum brainwave patterns. The ability to understand how our model arrived at its decisions will not only help clinicians to diagnose and treat harmful brain activities more accurately but also increase their trust and adoption of machine learning models in clinical practice; this could be an integral component of the ICU neurologists' standard workflow.</description>

      <title>Event-Free Moving Object Segmentation from Moving Ego Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moving object segmentation (MOS) in dynamic scenes is an important, challenging, but under-explored research topic for autonomous driving, especially for sequences obtained from moving ego vehicles. Most segmentation methods leverage motion cues obtained from optical flow maps. However, since these methods are often based on optical flows that are pre-computed from successive RGB frames, this neglects the temporal consideration of events occurring within the inter-frame, consequently constraining its ability to discern objects exhibiting relative staticity but genuinely in motion. To address these limitations, we propose to exploit event cameras for better video understanding, which provide rich motion cues without relying on optical flow. To foster research in this area, we first introduce a novel large-scale dataset called DSEC-MOS for moving object segmentation from moving ego vehicles, which is the first of its kind. For benchmarking, we select various mainstream methods and rigorously evaluate them on our dataset. Subsequently, we devise EmoFormer, a novel network able to exploit the event data. For this purpose, we fuse the event temporal prior with spatial semantic maps to distinguish genuinely moving objects from the static background, adding another level of dense supervision around our object of interest. Our proposed network relies only on event data for training but does not require event input during inference, making it directly comparable to frame-only methods in terms of efficiency and more widely usable in many application cases. The exhaustive comparison highlights a significant performance improvement of our method over all other methods. The source code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/ZZY-Zhou/DSEC-MOS.</description>

      <title>The RoboDepth Challenge: Methods and Advancements Towards Robust Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate depth estimation under out-of-distribution (OoD) scenarios, such as adverse weather conditions, sensor failure, and noise contamination, is desirable for safety-critical applications. Existing depth estimation systems, however, suffer inevitably from real-world corruptions and perturbations and are struggled to provide reliable depth predictions under such cases. In this paper, we summarize the winning solutions from the RoboDepth Challenge -- an academic competition designed to facilitate and advance robust OoD depth estimation. This challenge was developed based on the newly established KITTI-C and NYUDepth2-C benchmarks. We hosted two stand-alone tracks, with an emphasis on robust self-supervised and robust fully-supervised depth estimation, respectively. Out of more than two hundred participants, nine unique and top-performing solutions have appeared, with novel designs ranging from the following aspects: spatial- and frequency-domain augmentations, masked image modeling, image restoration and super-resolution, adversarial training, diffusion-based noise suppression, vision-language pre-training, learned model ensembling, and hierarchical feature enhancement. Extensive experimental analyses along with insightful observations are drawn to better understand the rationale behind each design. We hope this challenge could lay a solid foundation for future research on robust and reliable depth estimation and beyond. The datasets, competition toolkit, workshop recordings, and source code from the winning teams are publicly available on the challenge website.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our work introduces the YCB-Ev dataset, which contains synchronized RGB-D frames and event data that enables evaluating 6DoF object pose estimation algorithms using these modalities.
  This dataset provides ground truth 6DoF object poses for the same 21 YCB objects that were used in the YCB-Video (YCB-V) dataset, allowing for cross-dataset algorithm performance evaluation.
  The dataset consists of 21 synchronized event and RGB-D sequences, totalling 13,851 frames (7 minutes and 43 seconds of event data). Notably, 12 of these sequences feature the same object arrangement as the YCB-V subset used in the BOP challenge.
  Ground truth poses are generated by detecting objects in the RGB-D frames, interpolating the poses to align with the event timestamps, and then transferring them to the event coordinate frame using extrinsic calibration.
  Our dataset is the first to provide ground truth 6DoF pose data for event streams. Furthermore, we evaluate the generalization capabilities of two state-of-the-art algorithms, which were pre-trained for the BOP challenge, using our novel YCB-V sequences.
  The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/paroj/ycbev.</description>

      <title>Pre-trained Language Models Do Not Help Auto-regressive Text-to-Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in image tokenizers, such as VQ-VAE, have enabled text-to-image generation using auto-regressive methods, similar to language modeling. However, these methods have yet to leverage pre-trained language models, despite their adaptability to various downstream tasks. In this work, we explore this gap by adapting a pre-trained language model for auto-regressive text-to-image generation, and find that pre-trained language models offer limited help. We provide a two-fold explanation by analyzing tokens from each modality. First, we demonstrate that image tokens possess significantly different semantics compared to text tokens, rendering pre-trained language models no more effective in modeling them than randomly initialized ones. Second, the text tokens in the image-text datasets are too simple compared to normal language model pre-training data, which causes the catastrophic degradation of language models' capability.</description>

      <title>Continual Adversarial Defense</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09481v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In response to the rapidly evolving nature of adversarial attacks against visual classifiers on a monthly basis, numerous defenses have been proposed to generalize against as many known attacks as possible. However, designing a defense method that generalizes to all types of attacks is not realistic because the environment in which defense systems operate is dynamic and comprises various unique attacks that emerge as time goes on. A well-matched approach to the dynamic environment lies in a defense system that continuously collects adversarial data online to quickly improve itself. Therefore, we put forward a practical defense deployment against a challenging threat model and propose, for the first time, the Continual Adversarial Defense (CAD) framework that adapts to attack sequences under four principles: (1) continual adaptation to new attacks without catastrophic forgetting, (2) few-shot adaptation, (3) memory-efficient adaptation, and (4) high accuracy on both clean and adversarial data. We explore and integrate cutting-edge continual learning, few-shot learning, and ensemble learning techniques to qualify the principles. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach against multiple stages of modern adversarial attacks and demonstrate significant improvements over numerous baseline methods. In particular, CAD is capable of quickly adapting with minimal budget and a low cost of defense failure while maintaining good performance against previous attacks. Our research sheds light on a brand-new paradigm for continual defense adaptation against dynamic and evolving attacks.</description>

Abstract: Beyond attaining domain generalization (DG), visual recognition models should also be data-efficient during learning by leveraging limited labels. We study the problem of Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization (SSDG) which is crucial for real-world applications like automated healthcare. SSDG requires learning a cross-domain generalizable model when the given training data is only partially labelled. Empirical investigations reveal that the DG methods tend to underperform in SSDG settings, likely because they are unable to exploit the unlabelled data. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) shows improved but still inferior results compared to fully-supervised learning. A key challenge, faced by the best-performing SSL-based SSDG methods, is selecting accurate pseudo-labels under multiple domain shifts and reducing overfitting to source domains under limited labels. In this work, we propose new SSDG approach, which utilizes a novel uncertainty-guided pseudo-labelling with model averaging (UPLM). Our uncertainty-guided pseudo-labelling (UPL) uses model uncertainty to improve pseudo-labelling selection, addressing poor model calibration under multi-source unlabelled data. The UPL technique, enhanced by our novel model averaging (MA) strategy, mitigates overfitting to source domains with limited labels. Extensive experiments on key representative DG datasets suggest that our method demonstrates effectiveness against existing methods.

      <title>Identifying Unnecessary 3D Gaussians using Clustering for Fast Rendering of 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) is a new rendering approach that outperforms the neural radiance field (NeRF) in terms of both speed and image quality. 3D-GS represents 3D scenes by utilizing millions of 3D Gaussians and projects these Gaussians onto the 2D image plane for rendering. However, during the rendering process, a substantial number of unnecessary 3D Gaussians exist for the current view direction, resulting in significant computation costs associated with their identification. In this paper, we propose a computational reduction technique that quickly identifies unnecessary 3D Gaussians in real-time for rendering the current view without compromising image quality. This is accomplished through the offline clustering of 3D Gaussians that are close in distance, followed by the projection of these clusters onto a 2D image plane during runtime. Additionally, we analyze the bottleneck associated with the proposed technique when executed on GPUs and propose an efficient hardware architecture that seamlessly supports the proposed scheme. For the Mip-NeRF360 dataset, the proposed technique excludes 63% of 3D Gaussians on average before the 2D image projection, which reduces the overall rendering computation by almost 38.3% without sacrificing peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR). The proposed accelerator also achieves a speedup of 10.7x compared to a GPU.</description>

      <title>ScanTalk: 3D Talking Heads from Unregistered Scans</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech-driven 3D talking heads generation has emerged as a significant area of interest among researchers, presenting numerous challenges. Existing methods are constrained by animating faces with fixed topologies, wherein point-wise correspondence is established, and the number and order of points remains consistent across all identities the model can animate. In this work, we present \textbf{ScanTalk}, a novel framework capable of animating 3D faces in arbitrary topologies including scanned data. Our approach relies on the DiffusionNet architecture to overcome the fixed topology constraint, offering promising avenues for more flexible and realistic 3D animations. By leveraging the power of DiffusionNet, ScanTalk not only adapts to diverse facial structures but also maintains fidelity when dealing with scanned data, thereby enhancing the authenticity and versatility of generated 3D talking heads. Through comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating its capacity to generate realistic talking heads comparable to existing techniques. While our primary objective is to develop a generic method free from topological constraints, all state-of-the-art methodologies are bound by such limitations. Code for reproducing our results, and the pre-trained model are available at https://github.com/miccunifi/ScanTalk .</description>

      <title>ZoDi: Zero-Shot Domain Adaptation with Diffusion-Based Image Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning models achieve high accuracy in segmentation tasks among others, yet domain shift often degrades the models' performance, which can be critical in real-world scenarios where no target images are available. This paper proposes a zero-shot domain adaptation method based on diffusion models, called ZoDi, which is two-fold by the design: zero-shot image transfer and model adaptation. First, we utilize an off-the-shelf diffusion model to synthesize target-like images by transferring the domain of source images to the target domain. In this we specifically try to maintain the layout and content by utilising layout-to-image diffusion models with stochastic inversion. Secondly, we train the model using both source images and synthesized images with the original segmentation maps while maximizing the feature similarity of images from the two domains to learn domain-robust representations. Through experiments we show benefits of ZoDi in the task of image segmentation over state-of-the-art methods. It is also more applicable than existing CLIP-based methods because it assumes no specific backbone or models, and it enables to estimate the model's performance without target images by inspecting generated images. Our implementation will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Toward Tiny and High-quality Facial Makeup with Data Amplify Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15033v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contemporary makeup approaches primarily hinge on unpaired learning paradigms, yet they grapple with the challenges of inaccurate supervision (e.g., face misalignment) and sophisticated facial prompts (including face parsing, and landmark detection). These challenges prohibit low-cost deployment of facial makeup models, especially on mobile devices. To solve above problems, we propose a brand-new learning paradigm, termed "Data Amplify Learning (DAL)," alongside a compact makeup model named "TinyBeauty." The core idea of DAL lies in employing a Diffusion-based Data Amplifier (DDA) to "amplify" limited images for the model training, thereby enabling accurate pixel-to-pixel supervision with merely a handful of annotations. Two pivotal innovations in DDA facilitate the above training approach: (1) A Residual Diffusion Model (RDM) is designed to generate high-fidelity detail and circumvent the detail vanishing problem in the vanilla diffusion models; (2) A Fine-Grained Makeup Module (FGMM) is proposed to achieve precise makeup control and combination while retaining face identity. Coupled with DAL, TinyBeauty necessitates merely 80K parameters to achieve a state-of-the-art performance without intricate face prompts. Meanwhile, TinyBeauty achieves a remarkable inference speed of up to 460 fps on the iPhone 13. Extensive experiments show that DAL can produce highly competitive makeup models using only 5 image pairs.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Metric Learning for Visual Outlier Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical to deploy deep learning models in safety-critical applications. However, the inherent hierarchical concept structure of visual data, which is instrumental to OOD detection, is often poorly captured by conventional methods based on Euclidean geometry. This work proposes a metric framework that leverages the strengths of Hyperbolic geometry for OOD detection. Inspired by previous works that refine the decision boundary for OOD data with synthetic outliers, we extend this method to Hyperbolic space. Interestingly, we find that synthetic outliers do not benefit OOD detection in Hyperbolic space as they do in Euclidean space. Furthermore we explore the relationship between OOD detection performance and Hyperbolic embedding dimension, addressing practical concerns in resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments show that our framework improves the FPR95 for OOD detection from 22\% to 15\% and from 49% to 28% on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 respectively compared to Euclidean methods.</description>

      <title>RAP: Retrieval-Augmented Planner for Adaptive Procedure Planning in Instructional Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Procedure Planning in instructional videos entails generating a sequence of action steps based on visual observations of the initial and target states. Despite the rapid progress in this task, there remain several critical challenges to be solved: (1) Adaptive procedures: Prior works hold an unrealistic assumption that the number of action steps is known and fixed, leading to non-generalizable models in real-world scenarios where the sequence length varies. (2) Temporal relation: Understanding the step temporal relation knowledge is essential in producing reasonable and executable plans. (3) Annotation cost: Annotating instructional videos with step-level labels (i.e., timestamp) or sequence-level labels (i.e., action category) is demanding and labor-intensive, limiting its generalizability to large-scale datasets. In this work, we propose a new and practical setting, called adaptive procedure planning in instructional videos, where the procedure length is not fixed or pre-determined. To address these challenges, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Planner (RAP) model. Specifically, for adaptive procedures, RAP adaptively determines the conclusion of actions using an auto-regressive model architecture. For temporal relation, RAP establishes an external memory module to explicitly retrieve the most relevant state-action pairs from the training videos and revises the generated procedures. To tackle high annotation cost, RAP utilizes a weakly-supervised learning manner to expand the training dataset to other task-relevant, unannotated videos by generating pseudo labels for action steps. Experiments on CrossTask and COIN benchmarks show the superiority of RAP over traditional fixed-length models, establishing it as a strong baseline solution for adaptive procedure planning.</description>

      <title>CodecNeRF: Toward Fast Encoding and Decoding, Compact, and High-quality Novel-view Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved huge success in effectively capturing and representing 3D objects and scenes. However, to establish a ubiquitous presence in everyday media formats, such as images and videos, we need to fulfill three key objectives: 1. fast encoding and decoding time, 2. compact model sizes, and 3. high-quality renderings. Despite recent advancements, a comprehensive algorithm that adequately addresses all objectives has yet to be fully realized. In this work, we present CodecNeRF, a neural codec for NeRF representations, consisting of an encoder and decoder architecture that can generate a NeRF representation in a single forward pass. Furthermore, inspired by the recent parameter-efficient finetuning approaches, we propose a finetuning method to efficiently adapt the generated NeRF representations to a new test instance, leading to high-quality image renderings and compact code sizes. The proposed CodecNeRF, a newly suggested encoding-decoding-finetuning pipeline for NeRF, achieved unprecedented compression performance of more than 100x and remarkable reduction in encoding time while maintaining (or improving) the image quality on widely used 3D object datasets.</description>

      <title>Simple Image Signal Processing using Global Context Guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In modern smartphone cameras, the Image Signal Processor (ISP) is the core element that converts the RAW readings from the sensor into perceptually pleasant RGB images for the end users. The ISP is typically proprietary and handcrafted and consists of several blocks such as white balance, color correction, and tone mapping. Deep learning-based ISPs aim to transform RAW images into DSLR-like RGB images using deep neural networks. However, most learned ISPs are trained using patches (small regions) due to computational limitations. Such methods lack global context, which limits their efficacy on full-resolution images and harms their ability to capture global properties such as color constancy or illumination. First, we propose a novel module that can be integrated into any neural ISP to capture the global context information from the full RAW images. Second, we propose an efficient and simple neural ISP that utilizes our proposed module. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on different benchmarks using diverse and real smartphone images.</description>

      <title>Detecting Adversarial Data via Perturbation Forgery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a defense strategy against adversarial attacks, adversarial detection aims to identify and filter out adversarial data from the data flow based on discrepancies in distribution and noise patterns between natural and adversarial data. Although previous detection methods achieve high performance in detecting gradient-based adversarial attacks, new attacks based on generative models with imbalanced and anisotropic noise patterns evade detection. Even worse, existing techniques either necessitate access to attack data before deploying a defense or incur a significant time cost for inference, rendering them impractical for defending against newly emerging attacks that are unseen by defenders. In this paper, we explore the proximity relationship between adversarial noise distributions and demonstrate the existence of an open covering for them. By learning to distinguish this open covering from the distribution of natural data, we can develop a detector with strong generalization capabilities against all types of adversarial attacks. Based on this insight, we heuristically propose Perturbation Forgery, which includes noise distribution perturbation, sparse mask generation, and pseudo-adversarial data production, to train an adversarial detector capable of detecting unseen gradient-based, generative-model-based, and physical adversarial attacks, while remaining agnostic to any specific models. Comprehensive experiments conducted on multiple general and facial datasets, with a wide spectrum of attacks, validate the strong generalization of our method.</description>

      <title>Classification of Non-native Handwritten Characters Using Convolutional Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has accelerated the progress of handwritten character classification/recognition. Handwritten character recognition (HCR) has found applications in various domains, such as traffic signal detection, language translation, and document information extraction. However, the widespread use of existing HCR technology is yet to be seen as it does not provide reliable character recognition with outstanding accuracy. One of the reasons for unreliable HCR is that existing HCR methods do not take the handwriting styles of non-native writers into account. Hence, further improvement is needed to ensure the reliability and extensive deployment of character recognition technologies for critical tasks. In this work, the classification of English characters written by non-native users is performed by proposing a custom-tailored CNN model. We train this CNN with a new dataset called the handwritten isolated English character (HIEC) dataset. This dataset consists of 16,496 images collected from 260 persons. This paper also includes an ablation study of our CNN by adjusting hyperparameters to identify the best model for the HIEC dataset. The proposed model with five convolutional layers and one hidden layer outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of character recognition accuracy and achieves an accuracy of $\mathbf{97.04}$%. Compared with the second-best model, the relative improvement of our model in terms of classification accuracy is $\mathbf{4.38}$%.</description>

      <title>Bits-to-Photon: End-to-End Learned Scalable Point Cloud Compression for Direct Rendering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point cloud is a promising 3D representation for volumetric streaming in emerging AR/VR applications. Despite recent advances in point cloud compression, decoding and rendering high-quality images from lossy compressed point clouds is still challenging in terms of quality and complexity, making it a major roadblock to achieve real-time 6-Degree-of-Freedom video streaming. In this paper, we address this problem by developing a point cloud compression scheme that generates a bit stream that can be directly decoded to renderable 3D Gaussians. The encoder and decoder are jointly optimized to consider both bit-rates and rendering quality. It significantly improves the rendering quality while substantially reducing decoding and rendering time, compared to existing point cloud compression methods. Furthermore, the proposed scheme generates a scalable bit stream, allowing multiple levels of details at different bit-rate ranges. Our method supports real-time color decoding and rendering of high quality point clouds, thus paving the way for interactive 3D streaming applications with free view points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blind image deblurring is the process of recovering a sharp image from a blurred one without prior knowledge about the blur kernel. It is a small data problem, since the key challenge lies in estimating the unknown degrees of blur from a single image or limited data, instead of learning from large datasets. The solution depends heavily on developing algorithms that effectively model the image degradation process. We introduce a method that leverages a prior which targets the blur kernel to achieve effective deblurring across a wide range of image types. In our extensive empirical analysis, our algorithm achieves results that are competitive with the state-of-the-art blind image deblurring algorithms, and it offers up to two times faster inference, making it a highly efficient solution.</description>

      <title>HuatuoGPT-Vision, Towards Injecting Medical Visual Knowledge into Multimodal LLMs at Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4V, has led to significant advancements. However, these models still face challenges in medical multimodal capabilities due to limitations in the quantity and quality of medical vision-text data, stemming from data privacy concerns and high annotation costs. While pioneering approaches utilize PubMed's large-scale, de-identified medical image-text pairs to address these limitations, they still fall short due to inherent data noise. To tackle this, we refined medical image-text pairs from PubMed and employed MLLMs (GPT-4V) in an 'unblinded' capacity to denoise and reformat the data, resulting in the creation of the PubMedVision dataset with 1.3 million medical VQA samples. Our validation demonstrates that: (1) PubMedVision can significantly enhance the medical multimodal capabilities of current MLLMs, showing significant improvement in benchmarks including the MMMU Health &amp; Medicine track; (2) manual checks by medical experts and empirical results validate the superior data quality of our dataset compared to other data construction methods. Using PubMedVision, we train a 34B medical MLLM HuatuoGPT-Vision, which shows superior performance in medical multimodal scenarios among open-source MLLMs.</description>

Abstract: Weakly-supervised medical image segmentation is a challenging task that aims to reduce the annotation cost while keep the segmentation performance. In this paper, we present a novel framework, SimTxtSeg, that leverages simple text cues to generate high-quality pseudo-labels and study the cross-modal fusion in training segmentation models, simultaneously. Our contribution consists of two key components: an effective Textual-to-Visual Cue Converter that produces visual prompts from text prompts on medical images, and a text-guided segmentation model with Text-Vision Hybrid Attention that fuses text and image features. We evaluate our framework on two medical image segmentation tasks: colonic polyp segmentation and MRI brain tumor segmentation, and achieve consistent state-of-the-art performance.

      <title>Object-Aware Query Perturbation for Cross-Modal Image-Text Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pre-trained vision and language (V\&amp;L) models have substantially improved the performance of cross-modal image-text retrieval. In general, however, V\&amp;L models have limited retrieval performance for small objects because of the rough alignment between words and the small objects in the image. In contrast, it is known that human cognition is object-centric, and we pay more attention to important objects, even if they are small. To bridge this gap between the human cognition and the V\&amp;L model's capability, we propose a cross-modal image-text retrieval framework based on ``object-aware query perturbation.'' The proposed method generates a key feature subspace of the detected objects and perturbs the corresponding queries using this subspace to improve the object awareness in the image. In our proposed method, object-aware cross-modal image-text retrieval is possible while keeping the rich expressive power and retrieval performance of existing V\&amp;L models without additional fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets show that our method outperforms conventional algorithms. Our code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/NEC-N-SOGI/query-perturbation}.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models For Multi-Modal Generative Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion-based generative modeling has been achieving state-of-the-art results on various generation tasks. Most diffusion models, however, are limited to a single-generation modeling. Can we generalize diffusion models with the ability of multi-modal generative training for more generalizable modeling? In this paper, we propose a principled way to define a diffusion model by constructing a unified multi-modal diffusion model in a common diffusion space. We define the forward diffusion process to be driven by an information aggregation from multiple types of task-data, e.g., images for a generation task and labels for a classification task. In the reverse process, we enforce information sharing by parameterizing a shared backbone denoising network with additional modality-specific decoder heads. Such a structure can simultaneously learn to generate different types of multi-modal data with a multi-task loss, which is derived from a new multi-modal variational lower bound that generalizes the standard diffusion model. We propose several multimodal generation settings to verify our framework, including image transition, masked-image training, joint image-label and joint image-representation generative modeling. Extensive experimental results on ImageNet indicate the effectiveness of our framework for various multi-modal generative modeling, which we believe is an important research direction worthy of more future explorations.</description>

      <title>StreetSurfaceVis: a dataset of crowdsourced street-level imagery annotated by road surface type and quality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Road unevenness significantly impacts the safety and comfort of traffic participants, especially vulnerable groups such as cyclists and wheelchair users. To train models for comprehensive road surface assessments, we introduce StreetSurfaceVis, a novel dataset comprising 9,122 street-level images mostly from Germany collected from a crowdsourcing platform and manually annotated by road surface type and quality. By crafting a heterogeneous dataset, we aim to enable robust models that maintain high accuracy across diverse image sources. As the frequency distribution of road surface types and qualities is highly imbalanced, we propose a sampling strategy incorporating various external label prediction resources to ensure sufficient images per class while reducing manual annotation. More precisely, we estimate the impact of (1) enriching the image data with OpenStreetMap tags, (2) iterative training and application of a custom surface type classification model, (3) amplifying underrepresented classes through prompt-based classification with GPT-4o and (4) similarity search using image embeddings. Combining these strategies effectively reduces manual annotation workload while ensuring sufficient class representation.</description>

      <title>How Effective are Self-Supervised Models for Contact Identification in Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of video content via Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models has unveiled a dynamic field of study, emphasizing both the complex challenges and unique opportunities inherent in this area. Despite the growing body of research, the ability of SSL models to detect physical contacts in videos remains largely unexplored, particularly the effectiveness of methods such as downstream supervision with linear probing or full fine-tuning. This work aims to bridge this gap by employing eight different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based video SSL models to identify instances of physical contact within video sequences specifically. The Something-Something v2 (SSv2) and Epic-Kitchen (EK-100) datasets were chosen for evaluating these approaches due to the promising results on UCF101 and HMDB51, coupled with their limited prior assessment on SSv2 and EK-100. Additionally, these datasets feature diverse environments and scenarios, essential for testing the robustness and accuracy of video-based models. This approach not only examines the effectiveness of each model in recognizing physical contacts but also explores the performance in the action recognition downstream task. By doing so, valuable insights into the adaptability of SSL models in interpreting complex, dynamic visual information are contributed.</description>

      <title>ArtVLM: Attribute Recognition Through Vision-Based Prefix Language Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recognizing and disentangling visual attributes from objects is a foundation to many computer vision applications. While large vision language representations like CLIP had largely resolved the task of zero-shot object recognition, zero-shot visual attribute recognition remains a challenge because CLIP's contrastively-learned vision-language representation cannot effectively capture object-attribute dependencies. In this paper, we target this weakness and propose a sentence generation-based retrieval formulation for attribute recognition that is novel in 1) explicitly modeling a to-be-measured and retrieved object-attribute relation as a conditional probability graph, which converts the recognition problem into a dependency-sensitive language-modeling problem, and 2) applying a large pretrained Vision-Language Model (VLM) on this reformulation and naturally distilling its knowledge of image-object-attribute relations to use towards attribute recognition. Specifically, for each attribute to be recognized on an image, we measure the visual-conditioned probability of generating a short sentence encoding the attribute's relation to objects on the image. Unlike contrastive retrieval, which measures likelihood by globally aligning elements of the sentence to the image, generative retrieval is sensitive to the order and dependency of objects and attributes in the sentence. We demonstrate through experiments that generative retrieval consistently outperforms contrastive retrieval on two visual reasoning datasets, Visual Attribute in the Wild (VAW), and our newly-proposed Visual Genome Attribute Ranking (VGARank).</description>

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation models have made significant strides, producing outputs with improved visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and user control. These advancements hold great promise for improving surgical education by enabling more realistic, diverse, and interactive simulation environments. In this study, we introduce SurGen, a text-guided diffusion model tailored for surgical video synthesis. SurGen produces videos with the highest resolution and longest duration among existing surgical video generation models. We validate the visual and temporal quality of the outputs using standard image and video generation metrics. Additionally, we assess their alignment to the corresponding text prompts through a deep learning classifier trained on surgical data. Our results demonstrate the potential of diffusion models to serve as valuable educational tools for surgical trainees.</description>

      <title>RoboSense: Large-scale Dataset and Benchmark for Multi-sensor Low-speed Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust object detection and tracking under arbitrary sight of view is challenging yet essential for the development of Autonomous Vehicle technology. With the growing demand of unmanned function vehicles, near-field scene understanding becomes an important research topic in the areas of low-speed autonomous driving. Due to the complexity of driving conditions and diversity of near obstacles such as blind spots and high occlusion, the perception capability of near-field environment is still inferior than its farther counterpart. To further enhance the intelligent ability of unmanned vehicles, in this paper, we construct a multimodal data collection platform based on 3 main types of sensors (Camera, LiDAR and Fisheye), which supports flexible sensor configurations to enable dynamic sight of view for ego vehicle, either global view or local view. Meanwhile, a large-scale multi-sensor dataset is built, named RoboSense, to facilitate near-field scene understanding. RoboSense contains more than 133K synchronized data with 1.4M 3D bounding box and IDs annotated in the full $360^{\circ}$ view, forming 216K trajectories across 7.6K temporal sequences. It has $270\times$ and $18\times$ as many annotations of near-field obstacles within 5$m$ as the previous single-vehicle datasets such as KITTI and nuScenes. Moreover, we define a novel matching criterion for near-field 3D perception and prediction metrics. Based on RoboSense, we formulate 6 popular tasks to facilitate the future development of related research, where the detailed data analysis as well as benchmarks are also provided accordingly. Code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/suhaisheng/RoboSense.</description>

      <title>Distribution Backtracking Builds A Faster Convergence Trajectory for Diffusion Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accelerating the sampling speed of diffusion models remains a significant challenge. Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into a student generator to achieve one-step generation, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack). DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of the teacher model, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the teacher model's intermediate distributions, and its reverse can be viewed as the convergence trajectory from the student generator to the teacher model. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions along the path to approximate the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance, with FID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 64x64 dataset. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance. Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack.</description>

      <title>Guide-and-Rescale: Self-Guidance Mechanism for Effective Tuning-Free Real Image Editing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in large-scale text-to-image generative models, manipulating real images with these models remains a challenging problem. The main limitations of existing editing methods are that they either fail to perform with consistent quality on a wide range of image edits or require time-consuming hyperparameter tuning or fine-tuning of the diffusion model to preserve the image-specific appearance of the input image. We propose a novel approach that is built upon a modified diffusion sampling process via the guidance mechanism. In this work, we explore the self-guidance technique to preserve the overall structure of the input image and its local regions appearance that should not be edited. In particular, we explicitly introduce layout-preserving energy functions that are aimed to save local and global structures of the source image. Additionally, we propose a noise rescaling mechanism that allows to preserve noise distribution by balancing the norms of classifier-free guidance and our proposed guiders during generation. Such a guiding approach does not require fine-tuning the diffusion model and exact inversion process. As a result, the proposed method provides a fast and high-quality editing mechanism. In our experiments, we show through human evaluation and quantitative analysis that the proposed method allows to produce desired editing which is more preferable by humans and also achieves a better trade-off between editing quality and preservation of the original image. Our code is available at https://github.com/MACderRu/Guide-and-Rescale.</description>

      <title>Training-free Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval via Weighted Modality Fusion and Similarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR), which formulates the query as a combination of a reference image and modified text, has emerged as a new form of image search due to its enhanced ability to capture users' intentions. However, training a CIR model in a supervised manner typically requires labor-intensive collection of (reference image, text modifier, target image) triplets. While existing zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) methods eliminate the need for training on specific downstream datasets, they still require additional pretraining on large-scale image datasets. In this paper, we introduce a training-free approach for ZS-CIR. Our approach, Weighted Modality fusion and similarity for CIR (WeiMoCIR), operates under the assumption that image and text modalities can be effectively combined using a simple weighted average. This allows the query representation to be constructed directly from the reference image and text modifier. To further enhance retrieval performance, we employ multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate image captions for the database images and incorporate these textual captions into the similarity computation by combining them with image information using a weighted average. Our approach is simple, easy to implement, and its effectiveness is validated through experiments on the FashionIQ and CIRR datasets.</description>

      <title>MiniDrive: More Efficient Vision-Language Models with Multi-Level 2D Features as Text Tokens for Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) serve as general-purpose end-to-end models in autonomous driving, performing subtasks such as prediction, planning, and perception through question-and-answer interactions. However, most existing methods rely on computationally expensive visual encoders and large language models (LLMs), making them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios and real-time applications. Meanwhile, most existing VLMs lack the ability to process multiple images, making it difficult to adapt to multi-camera perception in autonomous driving. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called MiniDrive, which incorporates our proposed Feature Engineering Mixture of Experts (FE-MoE) module and Dynamic Instruction Adapter (DI-Adapter). The FE-MoE effectively maps 2D features into visual token embeddings before being input into the language model. The DI-Adapter enables the visual token embeddings to dynamically change with the instruction text embeddings, resolving the issue of static visual token embeddings for the same image in previous approaches. Compared to previous works, MiniDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of parameter size, floating point operations, and response efficiency, with the smallest version containing only 83M parameters.</description>

      <title>ProbTalk3D: Non-Deterministic Emotion Controllable Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation Synthesis Using VQ-VAE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio-driven 3D facial animation synthesis has been an active field of research with attention from both academia and industry. While there are promising results in this area, recent approaches largely focus on lip-sync and identity control, neglecting the role of emotions and emotion control in the generative process. That is mainly due to the lack of emotionally rich facial animation data and algorithms that can synthesize speech animations with emotional expressions at the same time. In addition, majority of the models are deterministic, meaning given the same audio input, they produce the same output motion. We argue that emotions and non-determinism are crucial to generate diverse and emotionally-rich facial animations. In this paper, we propose ProbTalk3D a non-deterministic neural network approach for emotion controllable speech-driven 3D facial animation synthesis using a two-stage VQ-VAE model and an emotionally rich facial animation dataset 3DMEAD. We provide an extensive comparative analysis of our model against the recent 3D facial animation synthesis approaches, by evaluating the results objectively, qualitatively, and with a perceptual user study. We highlight several objective metrics that are more suitable for evaluating stochastic outputs and use both in-the-wild and ground truth data for subjective evaluation. To our knowledge, that is the first non-deterministic 3D facial animation synthesis method incorporating a rich emotion dataset and emotion control with emotion labels and intensity levels. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art emotion-controlled, deterministic and non-deterministic models. We recommend watching the supplementary video for quality judgement. The entire codebase is publicly available (https://github.com/uuembodiedsocialai/ProbTalk3D/).</description>

Abstract: Traditional fish farming practices often lead to inefficient feeding, resulting in environmental issues and reduced productivity. We developed an innovative system combining computer vision and IoT technologies for precise Tilapia feeding. Our solution uses real-time IoT sensors to monitor water quality parameters and computer vision algorithms to analyze fish size and count, determining optimal feed amounts. A mobile app enables remote monitoring and control. We utilized YOLOv8 for keypoint detection to measure Tilapia weight from length, achieving \textbf{94\%} precision on 3,500 annotated images. Pixel-based measurements were converted to centimeters using depth estimation for accurate feeding calculations. Our method, with data collection mirroring inference conditions, significantly improved results. Preliminary estimates suggest this approach could increase production up to 58 times compared to traditional farms. Our models, code, and dataset are open-source~\footnote{The code, dataset, and models are available upon reasonable request.</description>

While existing survival analysis (SA) approaches have made exciting progress, they are generally limited to adopting highly-expressive architectures and only coarse-grained patient-level labels to learn prognostic visual representations from gigapixel WSIs. Such learning paradigm suffers from important performance bottlenecks, when facing present scarce training data and standard multi-instance learning (MIL) framework in CPATH. To overcome it, this paper, for the first time, proposes a new Vision-Language-based SA (VLSA) paradigm. Concretely, (1) VLSA is driven by pathology VL foundation models. It no longer relies on high-capability networks and shows the advantage of data efficiency. (2) In vision-end, VLSA encodes prognostic language prior and then employs it as auxiliary signals to guide the aggregating of prognostic visual features at instance level, thereby compensating for the weak supervision in MIL. Moreover, given the characteristics of SA, we propose i) ordinal survival prompt learning to transform continuous survival labels into textual prompts; and ii) ordinal incidence function as prediction target to make SA compatible with VL-based prediction. Notably, VLSA's predictions can be interpreted intuitively by our Shapley values-based method. The extensive experiments on five datasets confirm the effectiveness of our scheme. Our VLSA could pave a new way for SA in CPATH by offering weakly-supervised MIL an effective means to learn valuable prognostic clues from gigapixel WSIs.

      <title>FlexiTex: Enhancing Texture Generation with Visual Guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent texture generation methods achieve impressive results due to the powerful generative prior they leverage from large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. However, abstract textual prompts are limited in providing global textural or shape information, which results in the texture generation methods producing blurry or inconsistent patterns. To tackle this, we present FlexiTex, embedding rich information via visual guidance to generate a high-quality texture. The core of FlexiTex is the Visual Guidance Enhancement module, which incorporates more specific information from visual guidance to reduce ambiguity in the text prompt and preserve high-frequency details. To further enhance the visual guidance, we introduce a Direction-Aware Adaptation module that automatically designs direction prompts based on different camera poses, avoiding the Janus problem and maintaining semantically global consistency. Benefiting from the visual guidance, FlexiTex produces quantitatively and qualitatively sound results, demonstrating its potential to advance texture generation for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>JourneyBench: A Challenging One-Stop Vision-Language Understanding Benchmark of Generated Images</title>

Abstract: Existing vision-language understanding benchmarks largely consist of images of objects in their usual contexts. As a consequence, recent multimodal large language models can perform well with only a shallow visual understanding by relying on background language biases. Thus, strong performance on these benchmarks does not necessarily correlate with strong visual understanding. In this paper, we release JourneyBench, a comprehensive human-annotated benchmark of generated images designed to assess the model's fine-grained multimodal reasoning abilities across five tasks: complementary multimodal chain of thought, multi-image VQA, imaginary image captioning, VQA with hallucination triggers, and fine-grained retrieval with sample-specific distractors. Unlike existing benchmarks, JourneyBench explicitly requires fine-grained multimodal reasoning in unusual imaginary scenarios where language bias and holistic image gist are insufficient. We benchmark state-of-the-art models on JourneyBench and analyze performance along a number of fine-grained dimensions. Results across all five tasks show that JourneyBench is exceptionally challenging for even the best models, indicating that models' visual reasoning abilities are not as strong as they first appear. We discuss the implications of our findings and propose avenues for further research.</description>

      <title>Real-time estimation of overt attention from dynamic features of the face using deep-learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Students often drift in and out of focus during class. Effective teachers recognize this and re-engage them when necessary. With the shift to remote learning, teachers have lost the visual feedback needed to adapt to varying student engagement. We propose using readily available front-facing video to infer attention levels based on movements of the eyes, head, and face. We train a deep learning model to predict a measure of attention based on overt eye movements. Specifically, we measure Inter-Subject Correlation of eye movements in ten-second intervals while students watch the same educational videos. In 3 different experiments (N=83) we show that the trained model predicts this objective metric of attention on unseen data with $R^2$=0.38, and on unseen subjects with $R^2$=0.26-0.30. The deep network relies mostly on a student's eye movements, but to some extent also on movements of the brows, cheeks, and head. In contrast to Inter-Subject Correlation of the eyes, the model can estimate attentional engagement from individual students' movements without needing reference data from an attentive group. This enables a much broader set of online applications. The solution is lightweight and can operate on the client side, which mitigates some of the privacy concerns associated with online attention monitoring.

      <title>CVT-Occ: Cost Volume Temporal Fusion for 3D Occupancy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-based 3D occupancy prediction is significantly challenged by the inherent limitations of monocular vision in depth estimation. This paper introduces CVT-Occ, a novel approach that leverages temporal fusion through the geometric correspondence of voxels over time to improve the accuracy of 3D occupancy predictions. By sampling points along the line of sight of each voxel and integrating the features of these points from historical frames, we construct a cost volume feature map that refines current volume features for improved prediction outcomes. Our method takes advantage of parallax cues from historical observations and employs a data-driven approach to learn the cost volume. We validate the effectiveness of CVT-Occ through rigorous experiments on the Occ3D-Waymo dataset, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 3D occupancy prediction with minimal additional computational cost. The code is released at \url{https://github.com/Tsinghua-MARS-Lab/CVT-Occ}.</description>

      <title>DilateQuant: Accurate and Efficient Diffusion Quantization via Weight Dilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown excellent performance on various image generation tasks, but the substantial computational costs and huge memory footprint hinder their low-latency applications in real-world scenarios. Quantization is a promising way to compress and accelerate models. Nevertheless, due to the wide range and time-varying activations in diffusion models, existing methods cannot maintain both accuracy and efficiency simultaneously for low-bit quantization. To tackle this issue, we propose DilateQuant, a novel quantization framework for diffusion models that offers comparable accuracy and high efficiency. Specifically, we keenly aware of numerous unsaturated in-channel weights, which can be cleverly exploited to reduce the range of activations without additional computation cost. Based on this insight, we propose Weight Dilation (WD) that maximally dilates the unsaturated in-channel weights to a constrained range through a mathematically equivalent scaling. WD costlessly absorbs the activation quantization errors into weight quantization. The range of activations decreases, which makes activations quantization easy. The range of weights remains constant, which makes model easy to converge in training stage. Considering the temporal network leads to time-varying activations, we design a Temporal Parallel Quantizer (TPQ), which sets time-step quantization parameters and supports parallel quantization for different time steps, significantly improving the performance and reducing time cost. To further enhance performance while preserving efficiency, we introduce a Block-wise Knowledge Distillation (BKD) to align the quantized models with the full-precision models at a block level. The simultaneous training of time-step quantization parameters and weights minimizes the time required, and the shorter backpropagation paths decreases the memory footprint of the quantization process.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Machine Unlearning with Mnemonic Code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ethical and privacy issues inherent in artificial intelligence (AI) applications have been a growing concern with the rapid spread of deep learning. Machine unlearning (MU) is the research area that addresses these issues by making a trained AI model forget about undesirable training data. Unfortunately, most existing MU methods incur significant time and computational costs for forgetting. Therefore, it is often difficult to apply these methods to practical datasets and sophisticated architectures, e.g., ImageNet and Transformer. To tackle this problem, we propose a lightweight and effective MU method. Our method identifies the model parameters sensitive to the forgetting targets and adds perturbation to such model parameters. We identify the sensitive parameters by calculating the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). This approach does not require time-consuming additional training for forgetting. In addition, we introduce class-specific random signals called mnemonic code to reduce the cost of FIM calculation, which generally requires the entire training data and incurs significant computational costs. In our method, we train the model with mnemonic code; when forgetting, we use a small number of mnemonic codes to calculate the FIM and get the effective perturbation for forgetting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method is faster and better at forgetting than existing MU methods. Furthermore, we show that our method can scale to more practical datasets and sophisticated architectures.</description>

      <title>Improving Robustness and Reliability in Medical Image Classification with Latent-Guided Diffusion and Nested-Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15952v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensemble deep learning has been shown to achieve high predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimation in a wide variety of medical imaging contexts. However, perturbations in the input images at test time (e.g. noise, domain shifts) can still lead to significant performance degradation, posing challenges for trustworthy clinical deployment. In order to address this, we propose LaDiNE, a novel and robust probabilistic method that is capable of inferring informative and invariant latent variables from the input images. These latent variables are then used to recover the robust predictive distribution without relying on a predefined functional-form. This results in improved (i) generalization capabilities and (ii) calibration of prediction confidence. Extensive experiments were performed on the task of disease classification based on the Tuberculosis chest X-ray and the ISIC Melanoma skin cancer datasets. Here the performance of LaDiNE was analysed under a range of challenging covariate shift conditions, where training was based on "clean" images, and unseen noisy inputs and adversarial perturbations were presented at test time. Results show that LaDiNE outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of accuracy and confidence calibration. This increases the feasibility of deploying reliable medical machine learning models in real clinical settings, where accurate and trustworthy predictions are crucial for patient care and clinical decision support.</description>

      <title>Improving Performance in Colorectal Cancer Histology Decomposition using Deep and Ensemble Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In routine colorectal cancer management, histologic samples stained with hematoxylin and eosin are commonly used. Nonetheless, their potential for defining objective biomarkers for patient stratification and treatment selection is still being explored. The current gold standard relies on expensive and time-consuming genetic tests. However, recent research highlights the potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in facilitating the extraction of clinically relevant biomarkers from these readily available images. These CNN-based biomarkers can predict patient outcomes comparably to golden standards, with the added advantages of speed, automation, and minimal cost. The predictive potential of CNN-based biomarkers fundamentally relies on the ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify diverse tissue types from whole slide microscope images accurately. Consequently, enhancing the accuracy of tissue class decomposition is critical to amplifying the prognostic potential of imaging-based biomarkers. This study introduces a hybrid Deep and ensemble machine learning model that surpassed all preceding solutions for this classification task. Our model achieved 96.74% accuracy on the external test set and 99.89% on the internal test set. Recognizing the potential of these models in advancing the task, we have made them publicly available for further research and development.</description>

Abstract: We introduce LingoQA, a novel dataset and benchmark for visual question answering in autonomous driving. The dataset contains 28K unique short video scenarios, and 419K annotations. Evaluating state-of-the-art vision-language models on our benchmark shows that their performance is below human capabilities, with GPT-4V responding truthfully to 59.6% of the questions compared to 96.6% for humans. For evaluation, we propose a truthfulness classifier, called Lingo-Judge, that achieves a 0.95 Spearman correlation coefficient to human evaluations, surpassing existing techniques like METEOR, BLEU, CIDEr, and GPT-4. We establish a baseline vision-language model and run extensive ablation studies to understand its performance. We release our dataset and benchmark https://github.com/wayveai/LingoQA as an evaluation platform for vision-language models in autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Improving the Stability and Efficiency of Diffusion Models for Content Consistent Super-Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generative priors of pre-trained latent diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated great potential to enhance the visual quality of image super-resolution (SR) results. However, the noise sampling process in DMs introduces randomness in the SR outputs, and the generated contents can differ a lot with different noise samples. The multi-step diffusion process can be accelerated by distilling methods, but the generative capacity is difficult to control. To address these issues, we analyze the respective advantages of DMs and generative adversarial networks (GANs) and propose to partition the generative SR process into two stages, where the DM is employed for reconstructing image structures and the GAN is employed for improving fine-grained details. Specifically, we propose a non-uniform timestep sampling strategy in the first stage. A single timestep sampling is first applied to extract the coarse information from the input image, then a few reverse steps are used to reconstruct the main structures. In the second stage, we finetune the decoder of the pre-trained variational auto-encoder by adversarial GAN training for deterministic detail enhancement. Once trained, our proposed method, namely content consistent super-resolution (CCSR),allows flexible use of different diffusion steps in the inference stage without re-training. Extensive experiments show that with 2 or even 1 diffusion step, CCSR can significantly improve the content consistency of SR outputs while keeping high perceptual quality.

      <title>Realism in Action: Anomaly-Aware Diagnosis of Brain Tumors from Medical Images Using YOLOv8 and DeiT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of medical sciences, reliable detection and classification of brain tumors from images remains a formidable challenge due to the rarity of tumors within the population of patients. Therefore, the ability to detect tumors in anomaly scenarios is paramount for ensuring timely interventions and improved patient outcomes. This study addresses the issue by leveraging deep learning (DL) techniques to detect and classify brain tumors in challenging situations. The curated data set from the National Brain Mapping Lab (NBML) comprises 81 patients, including 30 Tumor cases and 51 Normal cases. The detection and classification pipelines are separated into two consecutive tasks. The detection phase involved comprehensive data analysis and pre-processing to modify the number of image samples and the number of patients of each class to anomaly distribution (9 Normal per 1 Tumor) to comply with real world scenarios. Next, in addition to common evaluation metrics for the testing, we employed a novel performance evaluation method called Patient to Patient (PTP), focusing on the realistic evaluation of the model. In the detection phase, we fine-tuned a YOLOv8n detection model to detect the tumor region. Subsequent testing and evaluation yielded competitive performance both in Common Evaluation Metrics and PTP metrics. Furthermore, using the Data Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) module, we distilled a Vision Transformer (ViT) model from a fine-tuned ResNet152 as a teacher in the classification phase. This approach demonstrates promising strides in reliable tumor detection and classification, offering potential advancements in tumor diagnosis for real-world medical imaging scenarios.</description>

      <title>EF-Calib: Spatiotemporal Calibration of Event- and Frame-Based Cameras Using Continuous-Time Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event camera, a bio-inspired asynchronous triggered camera, offers promising prospects for fusion with frame-based cameras owing to its low latency and high dynamic range. However, calibrating stereo vision systems that incorporate both event and frame-based cameras remains a significant challenge. In this letter, we present EF-Calib, a spatiotemporal calibration framework for event- and frame-based cameras using continuous-time trajectories. A novel calibration pattern applicable to both camera types and the corresponding event recognition algorithm is proposed. Leveraging the asynchronous nature of events, a derivable piece-wise B-spline to represent camera pose continuously is introduced, enabling calibration for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset, with analytical Jacobians provided. Various experiments are carried out to evaluate the calibration performance of EF-Calib, including calibration experiments for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset. Experimental results show that EF-Calib achieves the most accurate intrinsic parameters compared to current SOTA, the close accuracy of the extrinsic parameters compared to the frame-based results, and accurate time offset estimation. EF-Calib provides a convenient and accurate toolbox for calibrating the system that fuses events and frames. The code of this paper will also be open-sourced at: https://github.com/wsakobe/EF-Calib.</description>

      <title>A Scoping Review of Earth Observation and Machine Learning for Causal Inference: Implications for the Geography of Poverty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earth observation (EO) data such as satellite imagery can have far-reaching impacts on our understanding of the geography of poverty, especially when coupled with machine learning (ML) and computer vision. Early research in computer vision used predictive models to estimate living conditions, especially in contexts where data availability on poverty was scarce. Recent work has progressed beyond using EO data to predict such outcomes -- now also using it to conduct causal inference. However, how such EO-ML models are used for causality remains incompletely mapped. To address this gap, we conduct a scoping review where we first document the growth of interest in using satellite images and other sources of EO data in causal analysis. We then trace the methodological relationship between spatial statistics and ML methods before discussing five ways in which EO data has been used in scientific workflows -- (1) outcome imputation for downstream causal analysis, (2) EO image deconfounding, (3) EO-based treatment effect heterogeneity, (4) EO-based transportability analysis, and (5) image-informed causal discovery. We consolidate these observations by providing a detailed workflow for how researchers can incorporate EO data in causal analysis going forward -- from data requirements to choice of computer vision model and evaluation metrics. While our discussion focuses on health and living conditions outcomes, our workflow applies to other measures of sustainable development where EO data are informative.</description>

      <title>TroL: Traversal of Layers for Large Language and Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language and vision models (LLVMs) have been driven by the generalization power of large language models (LLMs) and the advent of visual instruction tuning. Along with scaling them up directly, these models enable LLVMs to showcase powerful vision language (VL) performances by covering diverse tasks via natural language instructions. However, existing open-source LLVMs that perform comparably to closed-source LLVMs such as GPT-4V are often considered too large (e.g., 26B, 34B, and 110B parameters), having a larger number of layers. These large models demand costly, high-end resources for both training and inference. To address this issue, we present a new efficient LLVM family with 1.8B, 3.8B, and 7B LLM model sizes, Traversal of Layers (TroL), which enables the reuse of layers in a token-wise manner. This layer traversing technique simulates the effect of looking back and retracing the answering stream while increasing the number of forward propagation layers without physically adding more layers. We demonstrate that TroL employs a simple layer traversing approach yet efficiently outperforms the open-source LLVMs with larger model sizes and rivals the performances of the closed-source LLVMs with substantial sizes.</description>

      <title>LiverUSRecon: Automatic 3D Reconstruction and Volumetry of the Liver with a Few Partial Ultrasound Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D reconstruction of the liver for volumetry is important for qualitative analysis and disease diagnosis. Liver volumetry using ultrasound (US) scans, although advantageous due to less acquisition time and safety, is challenging due to the inherent noisiness in US scans, blurry boundaries, and partial liver visibility. We address these challenges by using the segmentation masks of a few incomplete sagittal-plane US scans of the liver in conjunction with a statistical shape model (SSM) built using a set of CT scans of the liver. We compute the shape parameters needed to warp this canonical SSM to fit the US scans through a parametric regression network. The resulting 3D liver reconstruction is accurate and leads to automatic liver volume calculation. We evaluate the accuracy of the estimated liver volumes with respect to CT segmentation volumes using RMSE. Our volume computation is statistically much closer to the volume estimated using CT scans than the volume computed using Childs' method by radiologists: p-value of 0.094 (&gt;0.05) says that there is no significant difference between CT segmentation volumes and ours in contrast to Childs' method. We validate our method using investigations (ablation studies) on the US image resolution, the number of CT scans used for SSM, the number of principal components, and the number of input US scans. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automatic liver volumetry system using a few incomplete US scans given a set of CT scans of livers for SSM.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Denoising of Optical Coherence Tomography Images Using Residual U-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging is pivotal in diagnosing ophthalmic conditions by providing detailed cross-sectional images of the anterior and posterior segments of the eye. Nonetheless, speckle noise and other imaging artifacts inherent to OCT impede the accuracy of diagnosis significantly. In this study, we proposed an enhanced denoising model using a Residual U-Net architecture that effectively diminishes noise and improves image clarity across both Anterior Segment OCT (ASOCT) and polarization-sensitive OCT (PSOCT) images. Our approach demonstrated substantial improvements in image quality metrics: the Peak Signal Noise Ratio (PSNR) was 34.343 $\pm$ 1.113 for PSOCT images, and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) values were 0.885 $\pm$ 0.030, indicating enhanced preservation of tissue integrity and textural details. For ASOCT images, we observed the PSNR to be 23.525 $\pm$ 0.872 dB and SSIM 0.407 $\pm$ 0.044, reflecting significant enhancements in visual quality and structural accuracy. These metrics substantiate the models efficacy in not only reducing noise but also in maintaining crucial anatomical features, thereby enabling more precise and efficient clinical evaluations. The dual functionality across both ASOCT and PSOCT modalities underscores the versatility and potential for broad application in clinical settings, optimizing diagnostic processes and reducing the necessity for prolonged imaging sessions.</description>

      <title>Regional quality estimation for echocardiography using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic estimation of cardiac ultrasound image quality can be beneficial for guiding operators and ensuring the accuracy of clinical measurements. Previous work often fails to distinguish the view correctness of the echocardiogram from the image quality. Additionally, previous studies only provide a global image quality value, which limits their practical utility. In this work, we developed and compared three methods to estimate image quality: 1) classic pixel-based metrics like the generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) on myocardial segments as region of interest and left ventricle lumen as background, obtained using a U-Net segmentation 2) local image coherence derived from a U-Net model that predicts coherence from B-Mode images 3) a deep convolutional network that predicts the quality of each region directly in an end-to-end fashion. We evaluate each method against manual regional image quality annotations by three experienced cardiologists. The results indicate poor performance of the gCNR metric, with Spearman correlation to the annotations of rho = 0.24. The end-to-end learning model obtains the best result, rho = 0.69, comparable to the inter-observer correlation, rho = 0.63. Finally, the coherence-based method, with rho = 0.58, outperformed the classical metrics and is more generic than the end-to-end approach.</description>

      <title>OAPT: Offset-Aware Partition Transformer for Double JPEG Artifacts Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have shown remarkable performance in single JPEG artifacts removal task. However, existing methods tend to degrade on double JPEG images, which are prevalent in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Offset-Aware Partition Transformer for double JPEG artifacts removal, termed as OAPT. We conduct an analysis of double JPEG compression that results in up to four patterns within each 8x8 block and design our model to cluster the similar patterns to remedy the difficulty of restoration. Our OAPT consists of two components: compression offset predictor and image reconstructor. Specifically, the predictor estimates pixel offsets between the first and second compression, which are then utilized to divide different patterns. The reconstructor is mainly based on several Hybrid Partition Attention Blocks (HPAB), combining vanilla window-based self-attention and sparse attention for clustered pattern features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OAPT outperforms the state-of-the-art method by more than 0.16dB in double JPEG image restoration task. Moreover, without increasing any computation cost, the pattern clustering module in HPAB can serve as a plugin to enhance other transformer-based image restoration methods. The code will be available at https://github.com/QMoQ/OAPT.git .</description>

      <title>TransUKAN:Computing-Efficient Hybrid KAN-Transformer for Enhanced Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: U-Net is currently the most widely used architecture for medical image segmentation. Benefiting from its unique encoder-decoder architecture and skip connections, it can effectively extract features from input images to segment target regions. The commonly used U-Net is typically based on convolutional operations or Transformers, modeling the dependencies between local or global information to accomplish medical image analysis tasks. However, convolutional layers, fully connected layers, and attention mechanisms used in this process introduce a significant number of parameters, often requiring the stacking of network layers to model complex nonlinear relationships, which can impact the training process. To address these issues, we propose TransUKAN. Specifically, we have improved the KAN to reduce memory usage and computational load. On this basis, we explored an effective combination of KAN, Transformer, and U-Net structures. This approach enhances the model's capability to capture nonlinear relationships by introducing only a small number of additional parameters and compensates for the Transformer structure's deficiency in local information extraction. We validated TransUKAN on multiple medical image segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that TransUKAN achieves excellent performance with significantly reduced parameters. The code will be available athttps://github.com/wuyanlin-wyl/TransUKAN.</description>

      <title>FedRepOpt: Gradient Re-parameterized Optimizers in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving method for training machine learning models in a distributed manner on edge devices. However, on-device models face inherent computational power and memory limitations, potentially resulting in constrained gradient updates. As the model's size increases, the frequency of gradient updates on edge devices decreases, ultimately leading to suboptimal training outcomes during any particular FL round. This limits the feasibility of deploying advanced and large-scale models on edge devices, hindering the potential for performance enhancements. To address this issue, we propose FedRepOpt, a gradient re-parameterized optimizer for FL. The gradient re-parameterized method allows training a simple local model with a similar performance as a complex model by modifying the optimizer's gradients according to a set of model-specific hyperparameters obtained from the complex models. In this work, we focus on VGG-style and Ghost-style models in the FL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models using FedRepOpt obtain a significant boost in performance of 16.7% and 11.4% compared to the RepGhost-style and RepVGG-style networks, while also demonstrating a faster convergence time of 11.7% and 57.4% compared to their complex structure.</description>

      <title>Efficient Motion Prediction: A Lightweight &amp; Accurate Trajectory Prediction Model With Fast Training and Inference Speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For efficient and safe autonomous driving, it is essential that autonomous vehicles can predict the motion of other traffic agents. While highly accurate, current motion prediction models often impose significant challenges in terms of training resource requirements and deployment on embedded hardware. We propose a new efficient motion prediction model, which achieves highly competitive benchmark results while training only a few hours on a single GPU. Due to our lightweight architectural choices and the focus on reducing the required training resources, our model can easily be applied to custom datasets. Furthermore, its low inference latency makes it particularly suitable for deployment in autonomous applications with limited computing resources.</description>
