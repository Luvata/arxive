      <title>BoViLA: Bootstrapping Video-Language Alignment via LLM-Based Self-Questioning and Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of multi-modal models has been rapidly advancing, with some demonstrating remarkable capabilities. However, annotating video-text pairs remains expensive and insufficient. Take video question answering (VideoQA) tasks as an example, human annotated questions and answers often cover only part of the video, and similar semantics can also be expressed through different text forms, leading to underutilization of video. To address this, we propose BoViLA, a self-training framework that augments question samples during training through LLM-based self-questioning and answering, which help model exploit video information and the internal knowledge of LLMs more thoroughly to improve modality alignment. To filter bad self-generated questions, we introduce Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) to estimate uncertainty and assess the quality of self-generated questions by evaluating the modality alignment within the context. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to explore LLM-based self-training frameworks for modality alignment. We evaluate BoViLA on five strong VideoQA benchmarks, where it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. Additionally, we provide extensive analyses of the self-training framework and the EDL-based uncertainty filtering mechanism. The code will be made available at https://github.com/dunknsabsw/BoViLA.</description>

      <title>Complex-valued convolutional neural network classification of hand gesture from radar images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hand gesture recognition systems have yielded many exciting advancements in the last decade and become more popular in HCI (human-computer interaction) with several application areas, which spans from safety and security applications to automotive field. Various deep neural network architectures have already been inspected for hand gesture recognition systems, including multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN) and a cascade of the last two architectures known as CNN-RNN. However, a major problem still exists, which is most of the existing ML algorithms are designed and developed the building blocks and techniques for real-valued (RV). Researchers applied various RV techniques on the complex-valued (CV) radar images, such as converting a CV optimisation problem into a RV one, by splitting the complex numbers into their real and imaginary parts. However, the major disadvantage of this method is that the resulting algorithm will double the network dimensions. Recent work on RNNs and other fundamental theoretical analysis suggest that CV numbers have a richer representational capacity, but due to the absence of the building blocks required to design such models, the performance of CV networks are marginalised. In this report, we propose a fully CV-CNN, including all building blocks, forward and backward operations, and derivatives all in complex domain. We explore our proposed classification model on two sets of CV hand gesture radar images in comparison with the equivalent RV model. In chapter five, we propose a CV-forward residual network, for the purpose of binary classification of the two sets of CV hand gesture radar datasets and compare its performance with our proposed CV-CNN and a baseline CV-forward CNN.</description>

      <title>Mind the Uncertainty in Human Disagreement: Evaluating Discrepancies between Model Predictions and Human Responses in VQA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models frequently struggle to accurately predict responses provided by multiple human annotators, particularly when those responses exhibit human uncertainty. In this study, we focus on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task, and we comprehensively evaluate how well the state-of-the-art vision-language models correlate with the distribution of human responses. To do so, we categorize our samples based on their levels (low, medium, high) of human uncertainty in disagreement (HUD) and employ not only accuracy but also three new human-correlated metrics in VQA, to investigate the impact of HUD. To better align models with humans, we also verify the effect of common calibration and human calibration. Our results show that even BEiT3, currently the best model for this task, struggles to capture the multi-label distribution inherent in diverse human responses. Additionally, we observe that the commonly used accuracy-oriented calibration technique adversely affects BEiT3's ability to capture HUD, further widening the gap between model predictions and human distributions. In contrast, we show the benefits of calibrating models towards human distributions for VQA, better aligning model confidence with human uncertainty. Our findings highlight that for VQA, the consistent alignment between human responses and model predictions is understudied and should become the next crucial target of future studies.</description>

      <title>Guess What I Think: Streamlined EEG-to-Image Generation with Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating images from brain waves is gaining increasing attention due to its potential to advance brain-computer interface (BCI) systems by understanding how brain signals encode visual cues. Most of the literature has focused on fMRI-to-Image tasks as fMRI is characterized by high spatial resolution. However, fMRI is an expensive neuroimaging modality and does not allow for real-time BCI. On the other hand, electroencephalography (EEG) is a low-cost, non-invasive, and portable neuroimaging technique, making it an attractive option for future real-time applications. Nevertheless, EEG presents inherent challenges due to its low spatial resolution and susceptibility to noise and artifacts, which makes generating images from EEG more difficult. In this paper, we address these problems with a streamlined framework based on the ControlNet adapter for conditioning a latent diffusion model (LDM) through EEG signals. We conduct experiments and ablation studies on popular benchmarks to demonstrate that the proposed method beats other state-of-the-art models. Unlike these methods, which often require extensive preprocessing, pretraining, different losses, and captioning models, our approach is efficient and straightforward, requiring only minimal preprocessing and a few components. Code will be available after publication.</description>

      <title>Robust Symmetry Detection via Riemannian Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetries are ubiquitous across all kinds of objects, whether in nature or in man-made creations. While these symmetries may seem intuitive to the human eye, detecting them with a machine is nontrivial due to the vast search space. Classical geometry-based methods work by aggregating "votes" for each symmetry but struggle with noise. In contrast, learning-based methods may be more robust to noise, but often overlook partial symmetries due to the scarcity of annotated data. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a novel symmetry detection method that marries classical symmetry detection techniques with recent advances in generative modeling. Specifically, we apply Langevin dynamics to a redefined symmetry space to enhance robustness against noise. We provide empirical results on a variety of shapes that suggest our method is not only robust to noise, but can also identify both partial and global symmetries. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of our detected symmetries in various downstream tasks, such as compression and symmetrization of noisy shapes.</description>

      <title>Navigation with VLM framework: Go to Any Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating towards fully open language goals and exploring open scenes in a manner akin to human exploration have always posed significant challenges. Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning with both language and visual data. While many works have focused on leveraging VLMs for navigation in open scenes and with open vocabularies, these efforts often fall short of fully utilizing the potential of VLMs or require substantial computational resources. We introduce Navigation with VLM (NavVLM), a framework that harnesses equipment-level VLMs to enable agents to navigate towards any language goal specific or non-specific in open scenes, emulating human exploration behaviors without any prior training. The agent leverages the VLM as its cognitive core to perceive environmental information based on any language goal and constantly provides exploration guidance during navigation until it reaches the target location or area. Our framework not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) in traditional specific goal settings but also extends the navigation capabilities to any open-set language goal. We evaluate NavVLM in richly detailed environments from the Matterport 3D (MP3D), Habitat Matterport 3D (HM3D), and Gibson datasets within the Habitat simulator. With the power of VLMs, navigation has entered a new era.</description>

      <title>RoMo: A Robust Solver for Full-body Unlabeled Optical Motion Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical motion capture (MoCap) is the "gold standard" for accurately capturing full-body motions. To make use of raw MoCap point data, the system labels the points with corresponding body part locations and solves the full-body motions. However, MoCap data often contains mislabeling, occlusion and positional errors, requiring extensive manual correction. To alleviate this burden, we introduce RoMo, a learning-based framework for robustly labeling and solving raw optical motion capture data. In the labeling stage, RoMo employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to break down the complex full-body labeling challenge into manageable subtasks: alignment, full-body segmentation and part-specific labeling. To utilize the temporal continuity of markers, RoMo generates marker tracklets using a K-partite graph-based clustering algorithm, where markers serve as nodes, and edges are formed based on positional and feature similarities. For motion solving, to prevent error accumulation along the kinematic chain, we introduce a hybrid inverse kinematic solver that utilizes joint positions as intermediate representations and adjusts the template skeleton to match estimated joint positions. We demonstrate that RoMo achieves high labeling and solving accuracy across multiple metrics and various datasets. Extensive comparisons show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art research methods. On a real dataset, RoMo improves the F1 score of hand labeling from 0.94 to 0.98, and reduces joint position error of body motion solving by 25%. Furthermore, RoMo can be applied in scenarios where commercial systems are inadequate. The code and data for RoMo are available at https://github.com/non-void/RoMo.</description>

      <title>Logic-Free Building Automation: Learning the Control of Room Facilities with Wall Switches and Ceiling Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence enables smarter control in building automation by its learning capability of users' preferences on facility control. Reinforcement learning (RL) was one of the approaches to this, but it has many challenges in real-world implementations. We propose a new architecture for logic-free building automation (LFBA) that leverages deep learning (DL) to control room facilities without predefined logic. Our approach differs from RL in that it uses wall switches as supervised signals and a ceiling camera to monitor the environment, allowing the DL model to learn users' preferred controls directly from the scenes and switch states. This LFBA system is tested by our testbed with various conditions and user activities. The results demonstrate the efficacy, achieving 93%-98% control accuracy with VGG, outperforming other DL models such as Vision Transformer and ResNet. This indicates that LFBA can achieve smarter and more user-friendly control by learning from the observable scenes and user interactions.</description>

      <title>Estimating Body Volume and Height Using 3D Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate body weight estimation is critical in emergency medicine for proper dosing of weight-based medications, yet direct measurement is often impractical in urgent situations. This paper presents a non-invasive method for estimating body weight by calculating total body volume and height using 3D imaging technology. A RealSense D415 camera is employed to capture high-resolution depth maps of the patient, from which 3D models are generated. The Convex Hull Algorithm is then applied to calculate the total body volume, with enhanced accuracy achieved by segmenting the point cloud data into multiple sections and summing their individual volumes. The height is derived from the 3D model by identifying the distance between key points on the body. This combined approach provides an accurate estimate of body weight, improving the reliability of medical interventions where precise weight data is unavailable. The proposed method demonstrates significant potential to enhance patient safety and treatment outcomes in emergency settings.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Retrieval Augment Approach for Multimodal Emotion Recognition Under Missing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition utilizes complete multimodal information and robust multimodal joint representation to gain high performance. However, the ideal condition of full modality integrity is often not applicable in reality and there always appears the situation that some modalities are missing. For example, video, audio, or text data is missing due to sensor failure or network bandwidth problems, which presents a great challenge to MER research. Traditional methods extract useful information from the complete modalities and reconstruct the missing modalities to learn robust multimodal joint representation. These methods have laid a solid foundation for research in this field, and to a certain extent, alleviated the difficulty of multimodal emotion recognition under missing modalities. However, relying solely on internal reconstruction and multimodal joint learning has its limitations, especially when the missing information is critical for emotion recognition. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework of Retrieval Augment for Missing Modality Multimodal Emotion Recognition (RAMER), which introduces similar multimodal emotion data to enhance the performance of emotion recognition under missing modalities. By leveraging databases, that contain related multimodal emotion data, we can retrieve similar multimodal emotion information to fill in the gaps left by missing modalities. Various experimental results demonstrate that our framework is superior to existing state-of-the-art approaches in missing modality MER tasks. Our whole project is publicly available on https://github.com/WooyoohL/Retrieval_Augment_MER.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Impact of Randomness on Reproducibility in Computer Vision: A Study on Applications in Civil Engineering and Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reproducibility is essential for scientific research. However, in computer vision, achieving consistent results is challenging due to various factors. One influential, yet often unrecognized, factor is CUDA-induced randomness. Despite CUDA's advantages for accelerating algorithm execution on GPUs, if not controlled, its behavior across multiple executions remains non-deterministic. While reproducibility issues in ML being researched, the implications of CUDA-induced randomness in application are yet to be understood. Our investigation focuses on this randomness across one standard benchmark dataset and two real-world datasets in an isolated environment. Our results show that CUDA-induced randomness can account for differences up to 4.77% in performance scores. We find that managing this variability for reproducibility may entail increased runtime or reduce performance, but that disadvantages are not as significant as reported in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Task-Decoupled Image Inpainting Framework for Class-specific Object Remover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object removal refers to the process of erasing designated objects from an image while preserving the overall appearance. Existing works on object removal erase removal targets using image inpainting networks. However, image inpainting networks often generate unsatisfactory removal results. In this work, we find that the current training approach which encourages a single image inpainting model to handle both object removal and restoration tasks is one of the reasons behind such unsatisfactory result. Based on this finding, we propose a task-decoupled image inpainting framework which generates two separate inpainting models: an object restorer for object restoration tasks and an object remover for object removal tasks. We train the object restorer with the masks that partially cover the removal targets. Then, the proposed framework makes an object restorer to generate a guidance for training the object remover. Using the proposed framework, we obtain a class-specific object remover which focuses on removing objects of a target class, aiming to better erase target class objects than general object removers. We also introduce a data curation method that encompasses the image selection and mask generation approaches used to produce training data for the proposed class-specific object remover. Using the proposed curation method, we can simulate the scenarios where an object remover is trained on the data with object removal ground truth images. Experiments on multiple datasets show that the proposed class-specific object remover can better remove target class objects than object removers based on image inpainting networks.</description>

      <title>AirLetters: An Open Video Dataset of Characters Drawn in the Air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce AirLetters, a new video dataset consisting of real-world videos of human-generated, articulated motions. Specifically, our dataset requires a vision model to predict letters that humans draw in the air. Unlike existing video datasets, accurate classification predictions for AirLetters rely critically on discerning motion patterns and on integrating long-range information in the video over time. An extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art image and video understanding models on AirLetters shows that these methods perform poorly and fall far behind a human baseline. Our work shows that, despite recent progress in end-to-end video understanding, accurate representations of complex articulated motions -- a task that is trivial for humans -- remains an open problem for end-to-end learning.</description>

      <title>RSA: Resolving Scale Ambiguities in Monocular Depth Estimators through Language Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for metric-scale monocular depth estimation. Inferring depth from a single image is an ill-posed problem due to the loss of scale from perspective projection during the image formation process. Any scale chosen is a bias, typically stemming from training on a dataset; hence, existing works have instead opted to use relative (normalized, inverse) depth. Our goal is to recover metric-scaled depth maps through a linear transformation. The crux of our method lies in the observation that certain objects (e.g., cars, trees, street signs) are typically found or associated with certain types of scenes (e.g., outdoor). We explore whether language descriptions can be used to transform relative depth predictions to those in metric scale. Our method, RSA, takes as input a text caption describing objects present in an image and outputs the parameters of a linear transformation which can be applied globally to a relative depth map to yield metric-scaled depth predictions. We demonstrate our method on recent general-purpose monocular depth models on indoors (NYUv2) and outdoors (KITTI). When trained on multiple datasets, RSA can serve as a general alignment module in zero-shot settings. Our method improves over common practices in aligning relative to metric depth and results in predictions that are comparable to an upper bound of fitting relative depth to ground truth via a linear transformation.</description>

      <title>Fully Automated CTC Detection, Segmentation and Classification for Multi-Channel IF Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid biopsies (eg., blood draws) offer a less invasive and non-localized alternative to tissue biopsies for monitoring the progression of metastatic breast cancer (mBCa). Immunofluoresence (IF) microscopy is a tool to image and analyze millions of blood cells in a patient sample. By detecting and genetically sequencing circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood, personalized treatment plans are achievable for various cancer subtypes. However, CTCs are rare (about 1 in 2M), making manual CTC detection very difficult. In addition, clinicians rely on quantitative cellular biomarkers to manually classify CTCs. This requires prior tasks of cell detection, segmentation and feature extraction. To assist clinicians, we have developed a fully automated machine learning-based production-level pipeline to efficiently detect, segment and classify CTCs in multi-channel IF images. We achieve over 99% sensitivity and 97% specificity on 9,533 cells from 15 mBCa patients. Our pipeline has been successfully deployed on real mBCa patients, reducing a patient average of 14M detected cells to only 335 CTC candidates for manual review.</description>

      <title>PixelShuffler: A Simple Image Translation Through Pixel Rearrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-to-image translation is a topic in computer vision that has a vast range of use cases ranging from medical image translation, such as converting MRI scans to CT scans or to other MRI contrasts, to image colorization, super-resolution, domain adaptation, and generating photorealistic images from sketches or semantic maps. Image style transfer is also a widely researched application of image-to-image translation, where the goal is to synthesize an image that combines the content of one image with the style of another. Existing state-of-the-art methods often rely on complex neural networks, including diffusion models and language models, to achieve high-quality style transfer, but these methods can be computationally expensive and intricate to implement. In this paper, we propose a novel pixel shuffle method that addresses the image-to-image translation problem generally with a specific demonstrative application in style transfer. The proposed method approaches style transfer by shuffling the pixels of the style image such that the mutual information between the shuffled image and the content image is maximized. This approach inherently preserves the colors of the style image while ensuring that the structural details of the content image are retained in the stylized output. We demonstrate that this simple and straightforward method produces results that are comparable to state-of-the-art techniques, as measured by the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) loss for content preservation and the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) score for style similarity. Our experiments validate that the proposed pixel shuffle method achieves competitive performance with significantly reduced complexity, offering a promising alternative for efficient image style transfer, as well as a promise in usability of the method in general image-to-image translation tasks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Sparse Training versus Dense Training: The Unexpected Winner in Image Corruption Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally perceived that Dynamic Sparse Training opens the door to a new era of scalability and efficiency for artificial neural networks at, perhaps, some costs in accuracy performance for the classification task. At the same time, Dense Training is widely accepted as being the "de facto" approach to train artificial neural networks if one would like to maximize their robustness against image corruption. In this paper, we question this general practice. Consequently, we claim that, contrary to what is commonly thought, the Dynamic Sparse Training methods can consistently outperform Dense Training in terms of robustness accuracy, particularly if the efficiency aspect is not considered as a main objective (i.e., sparsity levels between 10% and up to 50%), without adding (or even reducing) resource cost. We validate our claim on two types of data, images and videos, using several traditional and modern deep learning architectures for computer vision and three widely studied Dynamic Sparse Training algorithms. Our findings reveal a new yet-unknown benefit of Dynamic Sparse Training and open new possibilities in improving deep learning robustness beyond the current state of the art.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Unseen: Guiding Personalized Diffusion Models to Expose Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have evolved into advanced image generation tools, especially for few-shot fine-tuning where a pretrained DM is fine-tuned on a small set of images to capture specific styles or objects. Many people upload these personalized checkpoints online, fostering communities such as Civitai and HuggingFace. However, model owners may overlook the potential risks of data leakage by releasing their fine-tuned checkpoints. Moreover, concerns regarding copyright violations arise when unauthorized data is used during fine-tuning. In this paper, we ask: "Can training data be extracted from these fine-tuned DMs shared online?" A successful extraction would present not only data leakage threats but also offer tangible evidence of copyright infringement. To answer this, we propose FineXtract, a framework for extracting fine-tuning data. Our method approximates fine-tuning as a gradual shift in the model's learned distribution -- from the original pretrained DM toward the fine-tuning data. By extrapolating the models before and after fine-tuning, we guide the generation toward high-probability regions within the fine-tuned data distribution. We then apply a clustering algorithm to extract the most probable images from those generated using this extrapolated guidance. Experiments on DMs fine-tuned with datasets such as WikiArt, DreamBooth, and real-world checkpoints posted online validate the effectiveness of our method, extracting approximately 20% of fine-tuning data in most cases, significantly surpassing baseline performance.</description>

      <title>AuroraCap: Efficient, Performant Video Detailed Captioning and a New Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video detailed captioning is a key task which aims to generate comprehensive and coherent textual descriptions of video content, benefiting both video understanding and generation. In this paper, we propose AuroraCap, a video captioner based on a large multimodal model. We follow the simplest architecture design without additional parameters for temporal modeling. To address the overhead caused by lengthy video sequences, we implement the token merging strategy, reducing the number of input visual tokens. Surprisingly, we found that this strategy results in little performance loss. AuroraCap shows superior performance on various video and image captioning benchmarks, for example, obtaining a CIDEr of 88.9 on Flickr30k, beating GPT-4V (55.3) and Gemini-1.5 Pro (82.2). However, existing video caption benchmarks only include simple descriptions, consisting of a few dozen words, which limits research in this field. Therefore, we develop VDC, a video detailed captioning benchmark with over one thousand carefully annotated structured captions. In addition, we propose a new LLM-assisted metric VDCscore for bettering evaluation, which adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy to transform long caption evaluation into multiple short question-answer pairs. With the help of human Elo ranking, our experiments show that this benchmark better correlates with human judgments of video detailed captioning quality.</description>

      <title>CLIP-Clique: Graph-based Correspondence Matching Augmented by Vision Language Models for Object-based Global Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a method of global localization on a map with semantic object landmarks. One of the most promising approaches for localization on object maps is to use semantic graph matching using landmark descriptors calculated from the distribution of surrounding objects. These descriptors are vulnerable to misclassification and partial observations. Moreover, many existing methods rely on inlier extraction using RANSAC, which is stochastic and sensitive to a high outlier rate. To address the former issue, we augment the correspondence matching using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Landmark discriminability is improved by VLM embeddings, which are independent of surrounding objects. In addition, inliers are estimated deterministically using a graph-theoretic approach. We also incorporate pose calculation using the weighted least squares considering correspondence similarity and observation completeness to improve the robustness. We confirmed improvements in matching and pose estimation accuracy through experiments on ScanNet and TUM datasets.</description>

      <title>DiffKillR: Killing and Recreating Diffeomorphisms for Cell Annotation in Dense Microscopy Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of digital microscopy images, driven by advances in automated whole slide scanning, presents significant opportunities for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. However, accurately annotating densely packed information in these images remains a major challenge. To address this, we introduce DiffKillR, a novel framework that reframes cell annotation as the combination of archetype matching and image registration tasks. DiffKillR employs two complementary neural networks: one that learns a diffeomorphism-invariant feature space for robust cell matching and another that computes the precise warping field between cells for annotation mapping. Using a small set of annotated archetypes, DiffKillR efficiently propagates annotations across large microscopy images, reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. More importantly, it is suitable for any type of pixel-level annotation. We will discuss the theoretical properties of DiffKillR and validate it on three microscopy tasks, demonstrating its advantages over existing supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised methods.</description>

      <title>DocKD: Knowledge Distillation from LLMs for Open-World Document Understanding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual document understanding (VDU) is a challenging task that involves understanding documents across various modalities (text and image) and layouts (forms, tables, etc.). This study aims to enhance generalizability of small VDU models by distilling knowledge from LLMs. We identify that directly prompting LLMs often fails to generate informative and useful data. In response, we present a new framework (called DocKD) that enriches the data generation process by integrating external document knowledge. Specifically, we provide an LLM with various document elements like key-value pairs, layouts, and descriptions, to elicit open-ended answers. Our experiments show that DocKD produces high-quality document annotations and surpasses the direct knowledge distillation approach that does not leverage external document knowledge. Moreover, student VDU models trained with solely DocKD-generated data are not only comparable to those trained with human-annotated data on in-domain tasks but also significantly excel them on out-of-domain tasks.</description>

      <title>Generative Edge Detection with Stable Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge detection is typically viewed as a pixel-level classification problem mainly addressed by discriminative methods. Recently, generative edge detection methods, especially diffusion model based solutions, are initialized in the edge detection task. Despite great potential, the retraining of task-specific designed modules and multi-step denoising inference limits their broader applications. Upon closer investigation, we speculate that part of the reason is the under-exploration of the rich discriminative information encoded in extensively pre-trained large models (\eg, stable diffusion models). Thus motivated, we propose a novel approach, named Generative Edge Detector (GED), by fully utilizing the potential of the pre-trained stable diffusion model. Our model can be trained and inferred efficiently without specific network design due to the rich high-level and low-level prior knowledge empowered by the pre-trained stable diffusion. Specifically, we propose to finetune the denoising U-Net and predict latent edge maps directly, by taking the latent image feature maps as input. Additionally, due to the subjectivity and ambiguity of the edges, we also incorporate the granularity of the edges into the denoising U-Net model as one of the conditions to achieve controllable and diverse predictions. Furthermore, we devise a granularity regularization to ensure the relative granularity relationship of the multiple predictions. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and achieve competitive performance (\eg, 0.870 and 0.880 in terms of ODS and OIS on the BSDS test dataset).</description>

      <title>Combing Text-based and Drag-based Editing for Precise and Flexible Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise and flexible image editing remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Based on the modified areas, most editing methods can be divided into two main types: global editing and local editing. In this paper, we choose the two most common editing approaches (ie text-based editing and drag-based editing) and analyze their drawbacks. Specifically, text-based methods often fail to describe the desired modifications precisely, while drag-based methods suffer from ambiguity. To address these issues, we proposed \textbf{CLIPDrag}, a novel image editing method that is the first to combine text and drag signals for precise and ambiguity-free manipulations on diffusion models. To fully leverage these two signals, we treat text signals as global guidance and drag points as local information. Then we introduce a novel global-local motion supervision method to integrate text signals into existing drag-based methods by adapting a pre-trained language-vision model like CLIP. Furthermore, we also address the problem of slow convergence in CLIPDrag by presenting a fast point-tracking method that enforces drag points moving toward correct directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLIPDrag outperforms existing single drag-based methods or text-based methods.</description>

      <title>Mamba in Vision: A Comprehensive Survey of Techniques and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mamba is emerging as a novel approach to overcome the challenges faced by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) in computer vision. While CNNs excel at extracting local features, they often struggle to capture long-range dependencies without complex architectural modifications. In contrast, ViTs effectively model global relationships but suffer from high computational costs due to the quadratic complexity of their self-attention mechanisms. Mamba addresses these limitations by leveraging Selective Structured State Space Models to effectively capture long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity. This survey analyzes the unique contributions, computational benefits, and applications of Mamba models while also identifying challenges and potential future research directions. We provide a foundational resource for advancing the understanding and growth of Mamba models in computer vision. An overview of this work is available at https://github.com/maklachur/Mamba-in-Computer-Vision.</description>

      <title>MBDS: A Multi-Body Dynamics Simulation Dataset for Graph Networks Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the structure and events of the physical world constitutes a fundamental objective of neural networks. Among the diverse approaches, Graph Network Simulators (GNS) have emerged as the leading method for modeling physical phenomena, owing to their low computational cost and high accuracy. The datasets employed for training and evaluating physical simulation techniques are typically generated by researchers themselves, often resulting in limited data volume and quality. Consequently, this poses challenges in accurately assessing the performance of these methods. In response to this, we have constructed a high-quality physical simulation dataset encompassing 1D, 2D, and 3D scenes, along with more trajectories and time-steps compared to existing datasets. Furthermore, our work distinguishes itself by developing eight complete scenes, significantly enhancing the dataset's comprehensiveness. A key feature of our dataset is the inclusion of precise multi-body dynamics, facilitating a more realistic simulation of the physical world. Utilizing our high-quality dataset, we conducted a systematic evaluation of various existing GNS methods. Our dataset is accessible for download at https://github.com/Sherlocktein/MBDS, offering a valuable resource for researchers to enhance the training and evaluation of their methodologies.</description>

      <title>ARB-LLM: Alternating Refined Binarizations for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly pushed forward advancements in natural language processing, yet their high memory and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Binarization, as an effective compression technique, can shrink model weights to just 1 bit, significantly reducing the high demands on computation and memory. However, current binarization methods struggle to narrow the distribution gap between binarized and full-precision weights, while also overlooking the column deviation in LLM weight distribution. To tackle these issues, we propose ARB-LLM, a novel 1-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) technique tailored for LLMs. To narrow the distribution shift between binarized and full-precision weights, we first design an alternating refined binarization (ARB) algorithm to progressively update the binarization parameters, which significantly reduces the quantization error. Moreover, considering the pivot role of calibration data and the column deviation in LLM weights, we further extend ARB to ARB-X and ARB-RC. In addition, we refine the weight partition strategy with column-group bitmap (CGB), which further enhance performance. Equipping ARB-X and ARB-RC with CGB, we obtain ARB-LLM$_\text{X}$ and ARB-LLM$_\text{RC}$ respectively, which significantly outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) binarization methods for LLMs. As a binary PTQ method, our ARB-LLM$_\text{RC}$ is the first to surpass FP16 models of the same size. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/ZHITENGLI/ARB-LLM.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap between Text, Audio, Image, and Any Sequence: A Novel Approach using Gloss-based Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative approach called BGTAI to simplify multimodal understanding by utilizing gloss-based annotation as an intermediate step in aligning Text and Audio with Images. While the dynamic temporal factors in textual and audio inputs contain various predicate adjectives that influence the meaning of the entire sentence, images, on the other hand, present static scenes. By representing text and audio as gloss notations that omit complex semantic nuances, a better alignment with images can potentially be achieved. This study explores the feasibility of this idea, specifically, we first propose the first Langue2Gloss model and then integrate it into the multimodal model UniBriVL for joint training. To strengthen the adaptability of gloss with text/audio and overcome the efficiency and instability issues in multimodal training, we propose a DS-Net (Data-Pair Selection Network), an Result Filter module, and a novel SP-Loss function. Our approach outperforms previous multimodal models in the main experiments, demonstrating its efficacy in enhancing multimodal representations and improving compatibility among text, audio, visual, and any sequence modalities.</description>

      <title>Redefining Temporal Modeling in Video Diffusion: The Vectorized Timestep Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image generation, and their extension to video generation has shown promise. However, current video diffusion models~(VDMs) rely on a scalar timestep variable applied at the clip level, which limits their ability to model complex temporal dependencies needed for various tasks like image-to-video generation. To address this limitation, we propose a frame-aware video diffusion model~(FVDM), which introduces a novel vectorized timestep variable~(VTV). Unlike conventional VDMs, our approach allows each frame to follow an independent noise schedule, enhancing the model's capacity to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies. FVDM's flexibility is demonstrated across multiple tasks, including standard video generation, image-to-video generation, video interpolation, and long video synthesis. Through a diverse set of VTV configurations, we achieve superior quality in generated videos, overcoming challenges such as catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning and limited generalizability in zero-shot methods.Our empirical evaluations show that FVDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in video generation quality, while also excelling in extended tasks. By addressing fundamental shortcomings in existing VDMs, FVDM sets a new paradigm in video synthesis, offering a robust framework with significant implications for generative modeling and multimedia applications.</description>

      <title>Selective Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer has achieved satisfactory results in the field of hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, existing Transformer models face two key challenges when dealing with HSI scenes characterized by diverse land cover types and rich spectral information: (1) fixed receptive field representation overlooks effective contextual information; (2) redundant self-attention feature representation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Selective Transformer (SFormer) for HSI classification. The SFormer is designed to dynamically select receptive fields for capturing both spatial and spectral contextual information, while mitigating the impact of redundant data by prioritizing the most relevant features. This enables a highly accurate classification of the land covers of the HSI. Specifically, a Kernel Selective Transformer Block (KSTB) is first utilized to dynamically select an appropriate receptive field range to effectively extract spatial-spectral features. Furthermore, to capture the most crucial tokens, a Token Selective Transformer Block (TSTB) is introduced, which selects the most relevant tokens based on the ranking of attention scores for each query. Extensive experiments on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed SFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art HSI classification models. The codes will be released.</description>

      <title>HRVMamba: High-Resolution Visual State Space Model for Dense Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, State Space Models (SSMs) with efficient hardware-aware designs, i.e., Mamba, have demonstrated significant potential in computer vision tasks due to their linear computational complexity with respect to token length and their global receptive field. However, Mamba's performance on dense prediction tasks, including human pose estimation and semantic segmentation, has been constrained by three key challenges: insufficient inductive bias, long-range forgetting, and low-resolution output representation. To address these challenges, we introduce the Dynamic Visual State Space (DVSS) block, which utilizes multi-scale convolutional kernels to extract local features across different scales and enhance inductive bias, and employs deformable convolution to mitigate the long-range forgetting problem while enabling adaptive spatial aggregation based on input and task-specific information. By leveraging the multi-resolution parallel design proposed in HRNet, we introduce High-Resolution Visual State Space Model (HRVMamba) based on the DVSS block, which preserves high-resolution representations throughout the entire process while promoting effective multi-scale feature learning. Extensive experiments highlight HRVMamba's impressive performance on dense prediction tasks, achieving competitive results against existing benchmark models without bells and whistles. Code is available at https://github.com/zhanghao5201/HRVMamba.</description>

      <title>Investigating and Mitigating Object Hallucinations in Pretrained Vision-Language (CLIP) Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance, yet research has pointed out a serious issue with object hallucinations within these models. However, there is no clear conclusion as to which part of the model these hallucinations originate from. In this paper, we present an in-depth investigation into the object hallucination problem specifically within the CLIP model, which serves as the backbone for many state-of-the-art vision-language systems. We unveil that even in isolation, the CLIP model is prone to object hallucinations, suggesting that the hallucination problem is not solely due to the interaction between vision and language modalities. To address this, we propose a counterfactual data augmentation method by creating negative samples with a variety of hallucination issues. We demonstrate that our method can effectively mitigate object hallucinations for CLIP model, and we show the the enhanced model can be employed as a visual encoder, effectively alleviating the object hallucination issue in LVLMs.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Character-Scene Interaction Synthesis from Text Instruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthesizing human motions in 3D environments, particularly those with complex activities such as locomotion, hand-reaching, and human-object interaction, presents substantial demands for user-defined waypoints and stage transitions. These requirements pose challenges for current models, leading to a notable gap in automating the animation of characters from simple human inputs. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a comprehensive framework for synthesizing multi-stage scene-aware interaction motions directly from a single text instruction and goal location. Our approach employs an auto-regressive diffusion model to synthesize the next motion segment, along with an autonomous scheduler predicting the transition for each action stage. To ensure that the synthesized motions are seamlessly integrated within the environment, we propose a scene representation that considers the local perception both at the start and the goal location. We further enhance the coherence of the generated motion by integrating frame embeddings with language input. Additionally, to support model training, we present a comprehensive motion-captured dataset comprising 16 hours of motion sequences in 120 indoor scenes covering 40 types of motions, each annotated with precise language descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method in generating high-quality, multi-stage motions closely aligned with environmental and textual conditions.</description>

      <title>Looking into Concept Explanation Methods for Diabetic Retinopathy Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes, and monitoring the progression of retinal abnormalities using fundus imaging is crucial. Because the images must be interpreted by a medical expert, it is infeasible to screen all individuals with diabetes for diabetic retinopathy. Deep learning has shown impressive results for automatic analysis and grading of fundus images. One drawback is, however, the lack of interpretability, which hampers the implementation of such systems in the clinic. Explainable artificial intelligence methods can be applied to explain the deep neural networks. Explanations based on concepts have shown to be intuitive for humans to understand, but have not yet been explored in detail for diabetic retinopathy grading. This work investigates and compares two concept-based explanation techniques for explaining deep neural networks developed for automatic diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy: Quantitative Testing with Concept Activation Vectors and Concept Bottleneck Models. We found that both methods have strengths and weaknesses, and choice of method should take the available data and the end user's preferences into account.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt tuning for vision-language models such as CLIP involves optimizing the text prompts used to generate image-text pairs for specific downstream tasks. While hand-crafted or template-based prompts are generally applicable to a wider range of unseen classes, they tend to perform poorly in downstream tasks (i.e., seen classes). Learnable soft prompts, on the other hand, often perform well in downstream tasks but lack generalizability. Additionally, prior research has predominantly concentrated on the textual modality, with very few studies attempting to explore the prompt's generalization potential from the visual modality. Keeping these limitations in mind, we investigate how to prompt tuning to obtain both a competitive downstream performance and generalization. The study shows that by treating soft and hand-crafted prompts as dual views of the textual modality, and maximizing their mutual information, we can better ensemble task-specific and general semantic information. Moreover, to generate more expressive prompts, the study introduces a class-wise augmentation from the visual modality, resulting in significant robustness to a wider range of unseen classes. Extensive evaluations on several benchmarks report that the proposed approach achieves competitive results in terms of both task-specific performance and general abilities.</description>

      <title>Tuning Timestep-Distilled Diffusion Model Using Pairwise Sample Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in timestep-distilled diffusion models have enabled high-quality image generation that rivals non-distilled multi-step models, but with significantly fewer inference steps. While such models are attractive for applications due to the low inference cost and latency, fine-tuning them with a naive diffusion objective would result in degraded and blurry outputs. An intuitive alternative is to repeat the diffusion distillation process with a fine-tuned teacher model, which produces good results but is cumbersome and computationally intensive; the distillation training usually requires magnitude higher of training compute compared to fine-tuning for specific image styles. In this paper, we present an algorithm named pairwise sample optimization (PSO), which enables the direct fine-tuning of an arbitrary timestep-distilled diffusion model. PSO introduces additional reference images sampled from the current time-step distilled model, and increases the relative likelihood margin between the training images and reference images. This enables the model to retain its few-step generation ability, while allowing for fine-tuning of its output distribution. We also demonstrate that PSO is a generalized formulation which can be flexibly extended to both offline-sampled and online-sampled pairwise data, covering various popular objectives for diffusion model preference optimization. We evaluate PSO in both preference optimization and other fine-tuning tasks, including style transfer and concept customization. We show that PSO can directly adapt distilled models to human-preferred generation with both offline and online-generated pairwise preference image data. PSO also demonstrates effectiveness in style transfer and concept customization by directly tuning timestep-distilled diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Frame-Voyager: Learning to Query Frames for Video Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding tasks. However, they are constrained by the maximum length of input tokens, making it impractical to input entire videos. Existing frame selection approaches, such as uniform frame sampling and text-frame retrieval, fail to account for the information density variations in the videos or the complex instructions in the tasks, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose Frame-Voyager that learns to query informative frame combinations, based on the given textual queries in the task. To train Frame-Voyager, we introduce a new data collection and labeling pipeline, by ranking frame combinations using a pre-trained Video-LLM. Given a video of M frames, we traverse its T-frame combinations, feed them into a Video-LLM, and rank them based on Video-LLM's prediction losses. Using this ranking as supervision, we train Frame-Voyager to query the frame combinations with lower losses. In experiments, we evaluate Frame-Voyager on four Video Question Answering benchmarks by plugging it into two different Video-LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that Frame-Voyager achieves impressive results in all settings, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for Video-LLMs.</description>

      <title>Sm: enhanced localization in Multiple Instance Learning for medical imaging classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is widely used in medical imaging classification to reduce the labeling effort. While only bag labels are available for training, one typically seeks predictions at both bag and instance levels (classification and localization tasks, respectively). Early MIL methods treated the instances in a bag independently. Recent methods account for global and local dependencies among instances. Although they have yielded excellent results in classification, their performance in terms of localization is comparatively limited. We argue that these models have been designed to target the classification task, while implications at the instance level have not been deeply investigated. Motivated by a simple observation -- that neighboring instances are likely to have the same label -- we propose a novel, principled, and flexible mechanism to model local dependencies. It can be used alone or combined with any mechanism to model global dependencies (e.g., transformers). A thorough empirical validation shows that our module leads to state-of-the-art performance in localization while being competitive or superior in classification.

      <title>Grounded-VideoLLM: Sharpening Fine-grained Temporal Grounding in Video Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in coarse-grained video understanding, however, they struggle with fine-grained temporal grounding. In this paper, we introduce Grounded-VideoLLM, a novel Video-LLM adept at perceiving and reasoning over specific video moments in a fine-grained manner. We identify that current Video-LLMs have limitations for fine-grained video understanding since they lack effective temporal modeling and timestamp representation. In light of this, we sharpen our model by incorporating (1) an additional temporal stream to encode the relationships between frames and (2) discrete temporal tokens enriched with specific time knowledge to represent timestamps. To optimize the training of Grounded-VideoLLM, we employ a multi-stage training scheme, beginning with simple video-captioning tasks and progressively introducing video temporal grounding tasks of increasing complexity. To further enhance Grounded-VideoLLM's temporal reasoning capability, we also curate a grounded VideoQA dataset by an automatic annotation pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Grounded-VideoLLM not only excels in fine-grained grounding tasks such as temporal sentence grounding, dense video captioning, and grounded VideoQA, but also shows great potential as a versatile video assistant for general video understanding.</description>

      <title>Action Selection Learning for Multi-label Multi-view Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-label multi-view action recognition aims to recognize multiple concurrent or sequential actions from untrimmed videos captured by multiple cameras. Existing work has focused on multi-view action recognition in a narrow area with strong labels available, where the onset and offset of each action are labeled at the frame-level. This study focuses on real-world scenarios where cameras are distributed to capture a wide-range area with only weak labels available at the video-level. We propose the method named MultiASL (Multi-view Action Selection Learning), which leverages action selection learning to enhance view fusion by selecting the most useful information from different viewpoints. The proposed method includes a Multi-view Spatial-Temporal Transformer video encoder to extract spatial and temporal features from multi-viewpoint videos. Action Selection Learning is employed at the frame-level, using pseudo ground-truth obtained from weak labels at the video-level, to identify the most relevant frames for action recognition. Experiments in a real-world office environment using the MM-Office dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Quo Vadis, Motion Generation? From Large Language Models to Large Motion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent success of LLMs, the field of human motion understanding has increasingly shifted towards the development of large motion models. Despite some progress, current state-of-the-art works remain far from achieving truly generalist models, largely due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality motion data. To address this, we present MotionBase, the first million-level motion generation benchmark, offering 15 times the data volume of the previous largest dataset, and featuring multimodal data with hierarchically detailed text descriptions. By leveraging this vast dataset, our large motion model demonstrates strong performance across a broad range of motions, including unseen ones. Through systematic investigation, we underscore the importance of scaling both data and model size, with synthetic data and pseudo labels playing a crucial role in mitigating data acquisition costs. Moreover, our research reveals the limitations of existing evaluation metrics, particularly in handling out-of-domain text instructions -- an issue that has long been overlooked. In addition to these, we introduce a novel 2D lookup-free approach for motion tokenization, which preserves motion information and expands codebook capacity, further enhancing the representative ability of large motion models. The release of MotionBase and the insights gained from this study are expected to pave the way for the development of more powerful and versatile motion generation models.</description>

      <title>Visual-O1: Understanding Ambiguous Instructions via Multi-modal Multi-turn Chain-of-thoughts Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large-scale models evolve, language instructions are increasingly utilized in multi-modal tasks. Due to human language habits, these instructions often contain ambiguities in real-world scenarios, necessitating the integration of visual context or common sense for accurate interpretation. However, even highly intelligent large models exhibit significant performance limitations on ambiguous instructions, where weak reasoning abilities of disambiguation can lead to catastrophic errors. To address this issue, this paper proposes Visual-O1, a multi-modal multi-turn chain-of-thought reasoning framework. It simulates human multi-modal multi-turn reasoning, providing instantial experience for highly intelligent models or empirical experience for generally intelligent models to understand ambiguous instructions. Unlike traditional methods that require models to possess high intelligence to understand long texts or perform lengthy complex reasoning, our framework does not significantly increase computational overhead and is more general and effective, even for generally intelligent models. Experiments show that our method not only significantly enhances the performance of models of different intelligence levels on ambiguous instructions but also improves their performance on general datasets. Our work highlights the potential of artificial intelligence to work like humans in real-world scenarios with uncertainty and ambiguity. We will release our data and code.</description>

      <title>Does SpatioTemporal information benefit Two video summarization benchmarks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important aspect of summarizing videos is understanding the temporal context behind each part of the video to grasp what is and is not important. Video summarization models have in recent years modeled spatio-temporal relationships to represent this information. These models achieved state-of-the-art correlation scores on important benchmark datasets. However, what has not been reviewed is whether spatio-temporal relationships are even required to achieve state-of-the-art results. Previous work in activity recognition has found biases, by prioritizing static cues such as scenes or objects, over motion information. In this paper we inquire if similar spurious relationships might influence the task of video summarization. To do so, we analyse the role that temporal information plays on existing benchmark datasets. We first estimate a baseline with temporally invariant models to see how well such models rank on benchmark datasets (TVSum and SumMe). We then disrupt the temporal order of the videos to investigate the impact it has on existing state-of-the-art models. One of our findings is that the temporally invariant models achieve competitive correlation scores that are close to the human baselines on the TVSum dataset. We also demonstrate that existing models are not affected by temporal perturbations. Furthermore, with certain disruption strategies that shuffle fixed time segments, we can actually improve their correlation scores. With these results, we find that spatio-temporal relationship play a minor role and we raise the question whether these benchmarks adequately model the task of video summarization.

      <title>EmojiHeroVR: A Study on Facial Expression Recognition under Partial Occlusion from Head-Mounted Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion recognition promotes the evaluation and enhancement of Virtual Reality (VR) experiences by providing emotional feedback and enabling advanced personalization. However, facial expressions are rarely used to recognize users' emotions, as Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) occlude the upper half of the face. To address this issue, we conducted a study with 37 participants who played our novel affective VR game EmojiHeroVR. The collected database, EmoHeVRDB (EmojiHeroVR Database), includes 3,556 labeled facial images of 1,778 reenacted emotions. For each labeled image, we also provide 29 additional frames recorded directly before and after the labeled image to facilitate dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (FER). Additionally, EmoHeVRDB includes data on the activations of 63 facial expressions captured via the Meta Quest Pro VR headset for each frame. Leveraging our database, we conducted a baseline evaluation on the static FER classification task with six basic emotions and neutral using the EfficientNet-B0 architecture. The best model achieved an accuracy of 69.84% on the test set, indicating that FER under HMD occlusion is feasible but significantly more challenging than conventional FER.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis and Ensemble Enhancement of Leading CNN Architectures for Breast Cancer Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel and accurate approach to breast cancer classification using histopathology images. It systematically compares leading Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models across varying image datasets, identifies their optimal hyperparameters, and ranks them based on classification efficacy. To maximize classification accuracy for each model we explore, the effects of data augmentation, alternative fully-connected layers, model training hyperparameter settings, and, the advantages of retraining models versus using pre-trained weights. Our methodology includes several original concepts, including serializing generated datasets to ensure consistent data conditions across training runs and significantly reducing training duration. Combined with automated curation of results, this enabled the exploration of over 2,000 training permutations -- such a comprehensive comparison is as yet unprecedented. Our findings establish the settings required to achieve exceptional classification accuracy for standalone CNN models and rank them by model efficacy. Based on these results, we propose ensemble architectures that stack three high-performing standalone CNN models together with diverse classifiers, resulting in improved classification accuracy. The ability to systematically run so many model permutations to get the best outcomes gives rise to very high quality results, including 99.75% for BreakHis x40 and BreakHis x200 and 95.18% for the Bach datasets when split into train, validation and test datasets. The Bach Online blind challenge, yielded 89% using this approach. Whilst this study is based on breast cancer histopathology image datasets, the methodology is equally applicable to other medical image datasets.</description>

      <title>An X-Ray Is Worth 15 Features: Sparse Autoencoders for Interpretable Radiology Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiological services are experiencing unprecedented demand, leading to increased interest in automating radiology report generation. Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) suffer from hallucinations, lack interpretability, and require expensive fine-tuning. We introduce SAE-Rad, which uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose latent representations from a pre-trained vision transformer into human-interpretable features. Our hybrid architecture combines state-of-the-art SAE advancements, achieving accurate latent reconstructions while maintaining sparsity. Using an off-the-shelf language model, we distil ground-truth reports into radiological descriptions for each SAE feature, which we then compile into a full report for each image, eliminating the need for fine-tuning large models for this task. To the best of our knowledge, SAE-Rad represents the first instance of using mechanistic interpretability techniques explicitly for a downstream multi-modal reasoning task. On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, SAE-Rad achieves competitive radiology-specific metrics compared to state-of-the-art models while using significantly fewer computational resources for training. Qualitative analysis reveals that SAE-Rad learns meaningful visual concepts and generates reports aligning closely with expert interpretations. Our results suggest that SAEs can enhance multimodal reasoning in healthcare, providing a more interpretable alternative to existing VLMs.</description>

      <title>LANTERN: Accelerating Visual Autoregressive Models with Relaxed Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auto-Regressive (AR) models have recently gained prominence in image generation, often matching or even surpassing the performance of diffusion models. However, one major limitation of AR models is their sequential nature, which processes tokens one at a time, slowing down generation compared to models like GANs or diffusion-based methods that operate more efficiently. While speculative decoding has proven effective for accelerating LLMs by generating multiple tokens in a single forward, its application in visual AR models remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify a challenge in this setting, which we term \textit{token selection ambiguity}, wherein visual AR models frequently assign uniformly low probabilities to tokens, hampering the performance of speculative decoding. To overcome this challenge, we propose a relaxed acceptance condition referred to as LANTERN that leverages the interchangeability of tokens in latent space. This relaxation restores the effectiveness of speculative decoding in visual AR models by enabling more flexible use of candidate tokens that would otherwise be prematurely rejected. Furthermore, by incorporating a total variation distance bound, we ensure that these speed gains are achieved without significantly compromising image quality or semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method in providing a substantial speed-up over speculative decoding. In specific, compared to a na\"ive application of the state-of-the-art speculative decoding, LANTERN increases speed-ups by $\mathbf{1.75}\times$ and $\mathbf{1.76}\times$, as compared to greedy decoding and random sampling, respectively, when applied to LlamaGen, a contemporary visual AR model.</description>

      <title>Lightning UQ Box: A Comprehensive Framework for Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is an essential tool for applying deep neural networks (DNNs) to real world tasks, as it attaches a degree of confidence to DNN outputs. However, despite its benefits, UQ is often left out of the standard DNN workflow due to the additional technical knowledge required to apply and evaluate existing UQ procedures. Hence there is a need for a comprehensive toolbox that allows the user to integrate UQ into their modelling workflow, without significant overhead. We introduce \texttt{Lightning UQ Box}: a unified interface for applying and evaluating various approaches to UQ. In this paper, we provide a theoretical and quantitative comparison of the wide range of state-of-the-art UQ methods implemented in our toolbox. We focus on two challenging vision tasks: (i) estimating tropical cyclone wind speeds from infrared satellite imagery and (ii) estimating the power output of solar panels from RGB images of the sky. By highlighting the differences between methods our results demonstrate the need for a broad and approachable experimental framework for UQ, that can be used for benchmarking UQ methods. The toolbox, example implementations, and further information are available at: https://github.com/lightning-uq-box/lightning-uq-box</description>

      <title>Img2CAD: Conditioned 3D CAD Model Generation from Single Image with Structured Visual Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Img2CAD, the first approach to our knowledge that uses 2D image inputs to generate CAD models with editable parameters. Unlike existing AI methods for 3D model generation using text or image inputs often rely on mesh-based representations, which are incompatible with CAD tools and lack editability and fine control, Img2CAD enables seamless integration between AI-based 3D reconstruction and CAD software. We have identified an innovative intermediate representation called Structured Visual Geometry (SVG), characterized by vectorized wireframes extracted from objects. This representation significantly enhances the performance of generating conditioned CAD models. Additionally, we introduce two new datasets to further support research in this area: ABC-mono, the largest known dataset comprising over 200,000 3D CAD models with rendered images, and KOCAD, the first dataset featuring real-world captured objects alongside their ground truth CAD models, supporting further research in conditioned CAD model generation.</description>

      <title>Images Speak Volumes: User-Centric Assessment of Image Generation for Accessible Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explanatory images play a pivotal role in accessible and easy-to-read (E2R) texts. However, the images available in online databases are not tailored toward the respective texts, and the creation of customized images is expensive. In this large-scale study, we investigated whether text-to-image generation models can close this gap by providing customizable images quickly and easily. We benchmarked seven, four open- and three closed-source, image generation models and provide an extensive evaluation of the resulting images. In addition, we performed a user study with people from the E2R target group to examine whether the images met their requirements. We find that some of the models show remarkable performance, but none of the models are ready to be used at a larger scale without human supervision. Our research is an important step toward facilitating the creation of accessible information for E2R creators and tailoring accessible images to the target group's needs.</description>

      <title>Dessie: Disentanglement for Articulated 3D Horse Shape and Pose Estimation from Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, 3D parametric animal models have been developed to aid in estimating 3D shape and pose from images and video. While progress has been made for humans, it's more challenging for animals due to limited annotated data. To address this, we introduce the first method using synthetic data generation and disentanglement to learn to regress 3D shape and pose. Focusing on horses, we use text-based texture generation and a synthetic data pipeline to create varied shapes, poses, and appearances, learning disentangled spaces. Our method, Dessie, surpasses existing 3D horse reconstruction methods and generalizes to other large animals like zebras, cows, and deer.

      <title>CLoSD: Closing the Loop between Simulation and Diffusion for multi-task character control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion diffusion models and Reinforcement Learning (RL) based control for physics-based simulations have complementary strengths for human motion generation. The former is capable of generating a wide variety of motions, adhering to intuitive control such as text, while the latter offers physically plausible motion and direct interaction with the environment. In this work, we present a method that combines their respective strengths. CLoSD is a text-driven RL physics-based controller, guided by diffusion generation for various tasks. Our key insight is that motion diffusion can serve as an on-the-fly universal planner for a robust RL controller. To this end, CLoSD maintains a closed-loop interaction between two modules -- a Diffusion Planner (DiP), and a tracking controller. DiP is a fast-responding autoregressive diffusion model, controlled by textual prompts and target locations, and the controller is a simple and robust motion imitator that continuously receives motion plans from DiP and provides feedback from the environment. CLoSD is capable of seamlessly performing a sequence of different tasks, including navigation to a goal location, striking an object with a hand or foot as specified in a text prompt, sitting down, and getting up. https://guytevet.github.io/CLoSD-page/</description>

      <title>Dynamic Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT), an emerging diffusion model for image generation, has demonstrated superior performance but suffers from substantial computational costs. Our investigations reveal that these costs stem from the static inference paradigm, which inevitably introduces redundant computation in certain diffusion timesteps and spatial regions. To address this inefficiency, we propose Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (DyDiT), an architecture that dynamically adjusts its computation along both timestep and spatial dimensions during generation. Specifically, we introduce a Timestep-wise Dynamic Width (TDW) approach that adapts model width conditioned on the generation timesteps. In addition, we design a Spatial-wise Dynamic Token (SDT) strategy to avoid redundant computation at unnecessary spatial locations. Extensive experiments on various datasets and different-sized models verify the superiority of DyDiT. Notably, with &lt;3% additional fine-tuning iterations, our method reduces the FLOPs of DiT-XL by 51%, accelerates generation by 1.73, and achieves a competitive FID score of 2.07 on ImageNet. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/ Dynamic-Diffusion-Transformer.</description>

      <title>VEDIT: Latent Prediction Architecture For Procedural Video Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Procedural video representation learning is an active research area where the objective is to learn an agent which can anticipate and forecast the future given the present video input, typically in conjunction with textual annotations. Prior works often rely on large-scale pretraining of visual encoders and prediction models with language supervision. However, the necessity and effectiveness of extending compute intensive pretraining to learn video clip sequences with noisy text supervision have not yet been fully validated by previous works. In this work, we show that a strong off-the-shelf frozen pretrained visual encoder, along with a well designed prediction model, can achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance in forecasting and procedural planning without the need for pretraining the prediction model, nor requiring additional supervision from language or ASR. Instead of learning representations from pixel space, our method utilizes the latent embedding space of publicly available vision encoders. By conditioning on frozen clip-level embeddings from observed steps to predict the actions of unseen steps, our prediction model is able to learn robust representations for forecasting through iterative denoising - leveraging the recent advances in diffusion transformers (Peebles &amp; Xie, 2023). Empirical studies over a total of five procedural learning tasks across four datasets (NIV, CrossTask, COIN and Ego4D-v2) show that our model advances the strong baselines in long-horizon action anticipation (+2.6% in Verb ED@20, +3.1% in Noun ED@20), and significantly improves the SoTA in step forecasting (+5.0%), task classification (+3.8%), and procedure planning tasks (up to +2.28% in success rate, +3.39% in mAcc, and +0.90% in mIoU).</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Framework for Deepfake Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of deepfake technology poses a significant threat to digital media integrity. Deepfakes, synthetic media created using AI, can convincingly alter videos and audio to misrepresent reality. This creates risks of misinformation, fraud, and severe implications for personal privacy and security. Our research addresses the critical issue of deepfakes through an innovative multimodal approach, targeting both visual and auditory elements. This comprehensive strategy recognizes that human perception integrates multiple sensory inputs, particularly visual and auditory information, to form a complete understanding of media content. For visual analysis, a model that employs advanced feature extraction techniques was developed, extracting nine distinct facial characteristics and then applying various machine learning and deep learning models. For auditory analysis, our model leverages mel-spectrogram analysis for feature extraction and then applies various machine learning and deep learningmodels. To achieve a combined analysis, real and deepfake audio in the original dataset were swapped for testing purposes and ensured balanced samples. Using our proposed models for video and audio classification i.e. Artificial Neural Network and VGG19, the overall sample is classified as deepfake if either component is identified as such. Our multimodal framework combines visual and auditory analyses, yielding an accuracy of 94%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image classification and denoising suffer from complementary issues of lack of robustness or partially ignoring conditioning information. We argue that they can be alleviated by unifying both tasks through a model of the joint probability of (noisy) images and class labels. Classification is performed with a forward pass followed by conditioning. Using the Tweedie-Miyasawa formula, we evaluate the denoising function with the score, which can be computed by marginalization and back-propagation. The training objective is then a combination of cross-entropy loss and denoising score matching loss integrated over noise levels. Numerical experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show competitive classification and denoising performance compared to reference deep convolutional classifiers/denoisers, and significantly improves efficiency compared to previous joint approaches. Our model shows an increased robustness to adversarial perturbations compared to a standard discriminative classifier, and allows for a novel interpretation of adversarial gradients as a difference of denoisers.</description>

      <title>Constructive Apraxia: An Unexpected Limit of Instructible Vision-Language Models and Analog for Human Cognitive Disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study reveals an unexpected parallel between instructible vision-language models (VLMs) and human cognitive disorders, specifically constructive apraxia. We tested 25 state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4 Vision, DALL-E 3, and Midjourney v5, on their ability to generate images of the Ponzo illusion, a task that requires basic spatial reasoning and is often used in clinical assessments of constructive apraxia. Remarkably, 24 out of 25 models failed to correctly render two horizontal lines against a perspective background, mirroring the deficits seen in patients with parietal lobe damage. The models consistently misinterpreted spatial instructions, producing tilted or misaligned lines that followed the perspective of the background rather than remaining horizontal. This behavior is strikingly similar to how apraxia patients struggle to copy or construct simple figures despite intact visual perception and motor skills. Our findings suggest that current VLMs, despite their advanced capabilities in other domains, lack fundamental spatial reasoning abilities akin to those impaired in constructive apraxia. This limitation in AI systems provides a novel computational model for studying spatial cognition deficits and highlights a critical area for improvement in VLM architecture and training methodologies.</description>

      <title>Not All Diffusion Model Activations Have Been Evaluated as Discriminative Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are initially designed for image generation. Recent research shows that the internal signals within their backbones, named activations, can also serve as dense features for various discriminative tasks such as semantic segmentation. Given numerous activations, selecting a small yet effective subset poses a fundamental problem. To this end, the early study of this field performs a large-scale quantitative comparison of the discriminative ability of the activations. However, we find that many potential activations have not been evaluated, such as the queries and keys used to compute attention scores. Moreover, recent advancements in diffusion architectures bring many new activations, such as those within embedded ViT modules. Both combined, activation selection remains unresolved but overlooked. To tackle this issue, this paper takes a further step with a much broader range of activations evaluated. Considering the significant increase in activations, a full-scale quantitative comparison is no longer operational. Instead, we seek to understand the properties of these activations, such that the activations that are clearly inferior can be filtered out in advance via simple qualitative evaluation. After careful analysis, we discover three properties universal among diffusion models, enabling this study to go beyond specific models. On top of this, we present effective feature selection solutions for several popular diffusion models. Finally, the experiments across multiple discriminative tasks validate the superiority of our method over the SOTA competitors.

      <title>Look Twice Before You Answer: Memory-Space Visual Retracing for Hallucination Mitigation in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are susceptible to hallucinations, especially assertively fabricating content not present in the visual inputs. To address the aforementioned challenge, we follow a common cognitive process - when one's initial memory of critical on-sight details fades, it is intuitive to look at them a second time to seek a factual and accurate answer. Therefore, we introduce Memory-space Visual Retracing (MemVR), a novel hallucination mitigation paradigm that without the need for external knowledge retrieval or additional fine-tuning. In particular, we treat visual prompts as supplementary evidence to be reinjected into MLLMs via Feed Forward Network (FFN) as key-value memory, when the model is uncertain or even amnesic about question-relevant visual memories. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that MemVR significantly mitigates hallucination issues across various MLLMs and excels in general benchmarks without incurring added time overhead, thus emphasizing its potential for widespread applicability.</description>

      <title>Variational Bayes Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a promising approach for modeling 3D scenes using mixtures of Gaussians. The predominant optimization method for these models relies on backpropagating gradients through a differentiable rendering pipeline, which struggles with catastrophic forgetting when dealing with continuous streams of data. To address this limitation, we propose Variational Bayes Gaussian Splatting (VBGS), a novel approach that frames training a Gaussian splat as variational inference over model parameters. By leveraging the conjugacy properties of multivariate Gaussians, we derive a closed-form variational update rule, allowing efficient updates from partial, sequential observations without the need for replay buffers. Our experiments show that VBGS not only matches state-of-the-art performance on static datasets, but also enables continual learning from sequentially streamed 2D and 3D data, drastically improving performance in this setting.</description>

      <title>Unlearnable 3D Point Clouds: Class-wise Transformation Is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional unlearnable strategies have been proposed to prevent unauthorized users from training on the 2D image data. With more 3D point cloud data containing sensitivity information, unauthorized usage of this new type data has also become a serious concern. To address this, we propose the first integral unlearnable framework for 3D point clouds including two processes: (i) we propose an unlearnable data protection scheme, involving a class-wise setting established by a category-adaptive allocation strategy and multi-transformations assigned to samples; (ii) we propose a data restoration scheme that utilizes class-wise inverse matrix transformation, thus enabling authorized-only training for unlearnable data. This restoration process is a practical issue overlooked in most existing unlearnable literature, \ie, even authorized users struggle to gain knowledge from 3D unlearnable data. Both theoretical and empirical results (including 6 datasets, 16 models, and 2 tasks) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed unlearnable framework.

      <title>Unraveling Cross-Modality Knowledge Conflict in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities for capturing and reasoning over multimodal inputs. However, these models are prone to parametric knowledge conflicts, which arise from inconsistencies of represented knowledge between their vision and language components. In this paper, we formally define the problem of $\textbf{cross-modality parametric knowledge conflict}$ and present a systematic approach to detect, interpret, and mitigate them. We introduce a pipeline that identifies conflicts between visual and textual answers, showing a persistently high conflict rate across modalities in recent LVLMs regardless of the model size. We further investigate how these conflicts interfere with the inference process and propose a contrastive metric to discern the conflicting samples from the others. Building on these insights, we develop a novel dynamic contrastive decoding method that removes undesirable logits inferred from the less confident modality components based on answer confidence. For models that do not provide logits, we also introduce two prompt-based strategies to mitigate the conflicts. Our methods achieve promising improvements in accuracy on both the ViQuAE and InfoSeek datasets. Specifically, using LLaVA-34B, our proposed dynamic contrastive decoding improves an average accuracy of 2.24%.</description>

      <title>Estimating Body and Hand Motion in an Ego-sensed World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present EgoAllo, a system for human motion estimation from a head-mounted device. Using only egocentric SLAM poses and images, EgoAllo guides sampling from a conditional diffusion model to estimate 3D body pose, height, and hand parameters that capture the wearer's actions in the allocentric coordinate frame of the scene. To achieve this, our key insight is in representation: we propose spatial and temporal invariance criteria for improving model performance, from which we derive a head motion conditioning parameterization that improves estimation by up to 18%. We also show how the bodies estimated by our system can improve the hands: the resulting kinematic and temporal constraints result in over 40% lower hand estimation errors compared to noisy monocular estimates.

      <title>Trust-informed Decision-Making Through An Uncertainty-Aware Stacked Neural Networks Framework: Case Study in COVID-19 Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an uncertainty-aware stacked neural networks model for the reliable classification of COVID-19 from radiological images. The model addresses the critical gap in uncertainty-aware modeling by focusing on accurately identifying confidently correct predictions while alerting users to confidently incorrect and uncertain predictions, which can promote trust in automated systems. The architecture integrates uncertainty quantification methods, including Monte Carlo dropout and ensemble techniques, to enhance predictive reliability by assessing the certainty of diagnostic predictions. Within a two-tier model framework, the tier one model generates initial predictions and associated uncertainties, which the second tier model uses to produce a trust indicator alongside the diagnostic outcome. This dual-output model not only predicts COVID-19 cases but also provides a trust flag, indicating the reliability of each diagnosis and aiming to minimize the need for retesting and expert verification. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on the COVIDx CXR-4 dataset, showing a novel approach in identifying and handling confidently incorrect cases and uncertain cases, thus enhancing the trustworthiness of automated diagnostics in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>AutoPETIII: The Tracer Frontier. What Frontier?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the last three years, the AutoPET competition gathered the medical imaging community around a hot topic: lesion segmentation on Positron Emitting Tomography (PET) scans. Each year a different aspect of the problem is presented; in 2024 the multiplicity of existing and used tracers was at the core of the challenge. Specifically, this year's edition aims to develop a fully automatic algorithm capable of performing lesion segmentation on a PET/CT scan, without knowing the tracer, which can either be a FDG or PSMA-based tracer. In this paper we describe how we used the nnUNetv2 framework to train two sets of 6 fold ensembles of models to perform fully automatic PET/CT lesion segmentation as well as a MIP-CNN to choose which set of models to use for segmentation.</description>

      <title>KLDD: Kalman Filter based Linear Deformable Diffusion Model in Retinal Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-based vascular segmentation is becoming increasingly common in enhancing the screening and treatment of ophthalmic diseases. Deep learning structures based on U-Net have achieved relatively good performance in vascular segmentation. However, small blood vessels and capillaries tend to be lost during segmentation when passed through the traditional U-Net downsampling module. To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel Kalman filter based Linear Deformable Diffusion (KLDD) model for retinal vessel segmentation. Our model employs a diffusion process that iteratively refines the segmentation, leveraging the flexible receptive fields of deformable convolutions in feature extraction modules to adapt to the detailed tubular vascular structures. More specifically, we first employ a feature extractor with linear deformable convolution to capture vascular structure information form the input images. To better optimize the coordinate positions of deformable convolution, we employ the Kalman filter to enhance the perception of vascular structures in linear deformable convolution. Subsequently, the features of the vascular structures extracted are utilized as a conditioning element within a diffusion model by the Cross-Attention Aggregation module (CAAM) and the Channel-wise Soft Attention module (CSAM). These aggregations are designed to enhance the diffusion model's capability to generate vascular structures. Experiments are evaluated on retinal fundus image datasets (DRIVE, CHASE_DB1) as well as the 3mm and 6mm of the OCTA-500 dataset, and the results show that the diffusion model proposed in this paper outperforms other methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Videos can be an effective way to deliver contextualized, just-in-time medical information for patient education. However, video analysis, from topic identification and retrieval to extraction and analysis of medical information and understandability from a patient perspective are extremely challenging tasks. This study demonstrates a data analysis pipeline that utilizes methods to retrieve medical information from YouTube videos on preparing for a colonoscopy exam, a much maligned and disliked procedure that patients find challenging to get adequately prepared for. We first use the YouTube Data API to collect metadata of desired videos on select search keywords and use Google Video Intelligence API to analyze texts, frames and objects data. Then we annotate the YouTube video materials on medical information, video understandability and overall recommendation. We develop a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model to identify medical terms in videos and build three classifiers to group videos based on the levels of encoded medical information and video understandability, and whether the videos are recommended or not. Our study provides healthcare stakeholders with guidelines and a scalable approach for generating new educational video content to enhance management of a vast number of health conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model the functional architecture of the early stages of three-dimensional vision by extending the neurogeometric sub-Riemannian model for stereo-vision introduced in \cite{BCSZ23}. A new framework for correspondence is introduced that integrates a neural-based algorithm to achieve stereo correspondence locally while, simultaneously, organizing the corresponding points into global perceptual units. The result is an effective scene segmentation. We achieve this using harmonic analysis on the sub-Riemannian structure and show, in a comparison against Riemannian distance, that the sub-Riemannian metric is central to the solution.</description>

      <title>SymmetricDiffusers: Learning Discrete Diffusion on Finite Symmetric Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite symmetric groups $S_n$ are essential in fields such as combinatorics, physics, and chemistry. However, learning a probability distribution over $S_n$ poses significant challenges due to its intractable size and discrete nature. In this paper, we introduce SymmetricDiffusers, a novel discrete diffusion model that simplifies the task of learning a complicated distribution over $S_n$ by decomposing it into learning simpler transitions of the reverse diffusion using deep neural networks. We identify the riffle shuffle as an effective forward transition and provide empirical guidelines for selecting the diffusion length based on the theory of random walks on finite groups. Additionally, we propose a generalized Plackett-Luce (PL) distribution for the reverse transition, which is provably more expressive than the PL distribution. We further introduce a theoretically grounded "denoising schedule" to improve sampling and learning efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performances on solving tasks including sorting 4-digit MNIST images, jigsaw puzzles, and traveling salesman problems. Our code is released at https://github.com/NickZhang53/SymmetricDiffusers.</description>

Abstract: While standardized codecs like JPEG and HEVC-intra represent the industry standard in image compression, neural Learned Image Compression (LIC) codecs represent a promising alternative. In detail, integrating attention mechanisms from Vision Transformers into LIC models has shown improved compression efficiency. However, extra efficiency often comes at the cost of aggregating redundant features. This work proposes a Graph-based Attention Block for Image Compression (GABIC), a method to reduce feature redundancy based on a k-Nearest Neighbors enhanced attention mechanism. Our experiments show that GABIC outperforms comparable methods, particularly at high bit rates, enhancing compression performance.</description>

      <title>MMP: Towards Robust Multi-Modal Learning with Masked Modality Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning seeks to combine data from multiple input sources to enhance the performance of different downstream tasks. In real-world scenarios, performance can degrade substantially if some input modalities are missing. Existing methods that can handle missing modalities involve custom training or adaptation steps for each input modality combination. These approaches are either tied to specific modalities or become computationally expensive as the number of input modalities increases. In this paper, we propose Masked Modality Projection (MMP), a method designed to train a single model that is robust to any missing modality scenario. We achieve this by randomly masking a subset of modalities during training and learning to project available input modalities to estimate the tokens for the masked modalities. This approach enables the model to effectively learn to leverage the information from the available modalities to compensate for the missing ones, enhancing missing modality robustness. We conduct a series of experiments with various baseline models and datasets to assess the effectiveness of this strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves robustness to different missing modality scenarios, outperforming existing methods designed for missing modalities or specific modality combinations.</description>

      <title>CPFD: Confidence-aware Privileged Feature Distillation for Short Video Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense features, customized for different business scenarios, are essential in short video classification. However, their complexity, specific adaptation requirements, and high computational costs make them resource-intensive and less accessible during online inference. Consequently, these dense features are categorized as `Privileged Dense Features'.Meanwhile, end-to-end multi-modal models have shown promising results in numerous computer vision tasks. In industrial applications, prioritizing end-to-end multi-modal features, can enhance efficiency but often leads to the loss of valuable information from historical privileged dense features.To integrate both features while maintaining efficiency and manageable resource costs, we present Confidence-aware Privileged Feature Distillation (CPFD), which empowers features of an end-to-end multi-modal model by adaptively distilling privileged features during training.Unlike existing privileged feature distillation (PFD) methods, which apply uniform weights to all instances during distillation, potentially causing unstable performance across different business scenarios and a notable performance gap between teacher model (Dense Feature enhanced multimodal-model DF-X-VLM) and student model (multimodal-model only X-VLM), our CPFD leverages confidence scores derived from the teacher model to adaptively mitigate the performance variance with the student model.We conducted extensive offline experiments on five diverse tasks demonstrating that CPFD improves the video classification F1 score by 6.76% compared with end-to-end multimodal-model (X-VLM) and by 2.31% with vanilla PFD on-average. And it reduces the performance gap by 84.6% and achieves results comparable to teacher model DF-X-VLM. The effectiveness of CPFD is further substantiated by online experiments, and our framework has been deployed in production systems for over a dozen models.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Asymptomatic Ratoon Stunting Disease Detection With Freely Available Satellite Based Multispectral Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disease detection in sugarcane, particularly the identification of asymptomatic infectious diseases such as Ratoon Stunting Disease (RSD), is critical for effective crop management. This study employed various machine learning techniques to detect the presence of RSD in different sugarcane varieties, using vegetation indices derived from freely available satellite-based spectral data. Our results show that the Support Vector Machine with a Radial Basis Function Kernel (SVM-RBF) was the most effective algorithm, achieving classification accuracy between 85.64\% and 96.55\%, depending on the variety. Gradient Boosting and Random Forest also demonstrated high performance achieving accuracy between 83.33\% to 96.55\%, while Logistic Regression and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis showed variable results across different varieties. The inclusion of sugarcane variety and vegetation indices was important in the detection of RSD. This agreed with what was identified in the current literature. Our study highlights the potential of satellite-based remote sensing as a cost-effective and efficient method for large-scale sugarcane disease detection alternative to traditional manual laboratory testing methods.</description>

      <title>ECHOPulse: ECG controlled echocardio-grams video generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Echocardiography (ECHO) is essential for cardiac assessments, but its video quality and interpretation heavily relies on manual expertise, leading to inconsistent results from clinical and portable devices. ECHO video generation offers a solution by improving automated monitoring through synthetic data and generating high-quality videos from routine health data. However, existing models often face high computational costs, slow inference, and rely on complex conditional prompts that require experts' annotations. To address these challenges, we propose ECHOPULSE, an ECG-conditioned ECHO video generation model. ECHOPULSE introduces two key advancements: (1) it accelerates ECHO video generation by leveraging VQ-VAE tokenization and masked visual token modeling for fast decoding, and (2) it conditions on readily accessible ECG signals, which are highly coherent with ECHO videos, bypassing complex conditional prompts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use time-series prompts like ECG signals for ECHO video generation. ECHOPULSE not only enables controllable synthetic ECHO data generation but also provides updated cardiac function information for disease monitoring and prediction beyond ECG alone. Evaluations on three public and private datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in ECHO video generation across both qualitative and quantitative measures. Additionally, ECHOPULSE can be easily generalized to other modality generation tasks, such as cardiac MRI, fMRI, and 3D CT generation. Demo can seen from \url{https://github.com/levyisthebest/ECHOPulse_Prelease}.</description>

      <title>ScriptViz: A Visualization Tool to Aid Scriptwriting based on a Large Movie Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scriptwriters usually rely on their mental visualization to create a vivid story by using their imagination to see, feel, and experience the scenes they are writing. Besides mental visualization, they often refer to existing images or scenes in movies and analyze the visual elements to create a certain mood or atmosphere. In this paper, we develop ScriptViz to provide external visualization based on a large movie database for the screenwriting process. It retrieves reference visuals on the fly based on scripts' text and dialogue from a large movie database. The tool provides two types of control on visual elements that enable writers to 1) see exactly what they want with fixed visual elements and 2) see variances in uncertain elements. User evaluation among 15 scriptwriters shows that ScriptViz is able to present scriptwriters with consistent yet diverse visual possibilities, aligning closely with their scripts and helping their creation.</description>

      <title>3D Segmentation of Neuronal Nuclei and Cell-Type Identification using Multi-channel Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background Analyzing images to accurately estimate the number of different cell types in the brain using automatic methods is a major objective in neuroscience. The automatic and selective detection and segmentation of neurons would be an important step in neuroanatomical studies. New method We present a method to improve the 3D reconstruction of neuronal nuclei that allows their segmentation, excluding the nuclei of non-neuronal cell types. Results We have tested the algorithm on stacks of images from rat neocortex, in a complex scenario (large stacks of images, uneven staining, and three different channels to visualize different cellular markers). It was able to provide a good identification ratio of neuronal nuclei and a 3D segmentation. Comparison with Existing Methods: Many automatic tools are in fact currently available, but different methods yield different cell count estimations, even in the same brain regions, due to differences in the labeling and imaging techniques, as well as in the algorithms used to detect cells. Moreover, some of the available automated software methods have provided estimations of cell numbers that have been reported to be inaccurate or inconsistent after evaluation by neuroanatomists. Conclusions It is critical to have a tool for automatic segmentation that allows discrimination between neurons, glial cells and perivascular cells. It would greatly speed up a task that is currently performed manually and would allow the cell counting to be systematic, avoiding human bias. Furthermore, the resulting 3D reconstructions of different cell types can be used to generate models of the spatial distribution of cells.</description>

      <title>Semantic Segmentation Based Quality Control of Histopathology Whole Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a software pipeline for quality control (QC) of histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) that segments various regions, such as blurs of different levels, tissue regions, tissue folds, and pen marks. Given the necessity and increasing availability of GPUs for processing WSIs, the proposed pipeline comprises multiple lightweight deep learning models to strike a balance between accuracy and speed. The pipeline was evaluated in all TCGAs, which is the largest publicly available WSI dataset containing more than 11,000 histopathological images from 28 organs. It was compared to a previous work, which was not based on deep learning, and it showed consistent improvement in segmentation results across organs. To minimize annotation effort for tissue and blur segmentation, annotated images were automatically prepared by mosaicking patches (sub-images) from various WSIs whose labels were identified using a patch classification tool HistoROI. Due to the generality of our trained QC pipeline and its extensive testing the potential impact of this work is broad. It can be used for automated pre-processing any WSI cohort to enhance the accuracy and reliability of large-scale histopathology image analysis for both research and clinical use. We have made the trained models, training scripts, training data, and inference results publicly available at https://github.com/abhijeetptl5/wsisegqc, which should enable the research community to use the pipeline right out of the box or further customize it to new datasets and applications in the future.</description>

      <title>SELU: Self-Learning Embodied MLLMs in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong visual understanding and decision-making capabilities, enabling the exploration of autonomously improving MLLMs in unknown environments. However, external feedback like human or environmental feedback is not always available. To address this challenge, existing methods primarily focus on enhancing the decision-making capabilities of MLLMs through voting and scoring mechanisms, while little effort has been paid to improving the environmental comprehension of MLLMs in unknown environments. To fully unleash the self-learning potential of MLLMs, we propose a novel actor-critic self-learning paradigm, dubbed SELU, inspired by the actor-critic paradigm in reinforcement learning. The critic employs self-asking and hindsight relabeling to extract knowledge from interaction trajectories collected by the actor, thereby augmenting its environmental comprehension. Simultaneously, the actor is improved by the self-feedback provided by the critic, enhancing its decision-making. We evaluate our method in the AI2-THOR and VirtualHome environments, and SELU achieves critic improvements of approximately 28% and 30%, and actor improvements of about 20% and 24% via self-learning.</description>

      <title>Lost in Tracking: Uncertainty-guided Cardiac Cine MRI Segmentation at Right Ventricle Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate biventricular segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) cine images is essential for the clinical evaluation of heart function. However, compared to left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV) segmentation is still more challenging and less reproducible. Degenerate performance frequently occurs at the RV base, where the in-plane anatomical structures are complex (with atria, valve, and aorta) and vary due to the strong interplanar motion. In this work, we propose to address the currently unsolved issues in CMR segmentation, specifically at the RV base, with two strategies: first, we complemented the public resource by reannotating the RV base in the ACDC dataset, with refined delineation of the right ventricle outflow tract (RVOT), under the guidance of an expert cardiologist. Second, we proposed a novel dual encoder U-Net architecture that leverages temporal incoherence to inform the segmentation when interplanar motions occur. The inter-planar motion is characterized by loss-of-tracking, via Bayesian uncertainty of a motion-tracking model. Our experiments showed that our method significantly improved RV base segmentation taking into account temporal incoherence. Furthermore, we investigated the reproducibility of deep learning-based segmentation and showed that the combination of consistent annotation and loss of tracking could enhance the reproducibility of RV segmentation, potentially facilitating a large number of clinical studies focusing on RV.</description>

      <title>Audio-Agent: Leveraging LLMs For Audio Generation, Editing and Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Audio-Agent, a multimodal framework for audio generation, editing and composition based on text or video inputs. Conventional approaches for text-to-audio (TTA) tasks often make single-pass inferences from text descriptions. While straightforward, this design struggles to produce high-quality audio when given complex text conditions. In our method, we utilize a pre-trained TTA diffusion network as the audio generation agent to work in tandem with GPT-4, which decomposes the text condition into atomic, specific instructions, and calls the agent for audio generation. Consequently, Audio-Agent generates high-quality audio that is closely aligned with the provided text or video while also supporting variable-length generation. For video-to-audio (VTA) tasks, most existing methods require training a timestamp detector to synchronize video events with generated audio, a process that can be tedious and time-consuming. We propose a simpler approach by fine-tuning a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM), e.g., Gemma2-2B-it, to obtain both semantic and temporal conditions to bridge video and audio modality. Thus our framework provides a comprehensive solution for both TTA and VTA tasks without substantial computational overhead in training.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced Harmonic Densely Connected Hybrid Transformer Network Architecture for Chronic Wound Segmentation Utilising Multi-Colour Space Tensor Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chronic wounds and associated complications present ever growing burdens for clinics and hospitals world wide. Venous, arterial, diabetic, and pressure wounds are becoming increasingly common globally. These conditions can result in highly debilitating repercussions for those affected, with limb amputations and increased mortality risk resulting from infection becoming more common. New methods to assist clinicians in chronic wound care are therefore vital to maintain high quality care standards. This paper presents an improved HarDNet segmentation architecture which integrates a contrast-eliminating component in the initial layers of the network to enhance feature learning. We also utilise a multi-colour space tensor merging process and adjust the harmonic shape of the convolution blocks to facilitate these additional features. We train our proposed model using wound images from light-skinned patients and test the model on two test sets (one set with ground truth, and one without) comprising only darker-skinned cases. Subjective ratings are obtained from clinical wound experts with intraclass correlation coefficient used to determine inter-rater reliability. For the dark-skin tone test set with ground truth, we demonstrate improvements in terms of Dice similarity coefficient (+0.1221) and intersection over union (+0.1274). Qualitative analysis showed high expert ratings, with improvements of &gt;3% demonstrated when comparing the baseline model with the proposed model. This paper presents the first study to focus on darker-skin tones for chronic wound segmentation using models trained only on wound images exhibiting lighter skin. Diabetes is highly prevalent in countries where patients have darker skin tones, highlighting the need for a greater focus on such cases. Additionally, we conduct the largest qualitative study to date for chronic wound segmentation.</description>

Abstract: While laparoscopic liver resection is less prone to complications and maintains patient outcomes compared to traditional open surgery, its complexity hinders widespread adoption due to challenges in representing the liver's internal structure. Laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasound offers efficient, cost-effective and radiation-free guidance. Our objective is to aid physicians in identifying internal liver structures using laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasound. We propose a patient-specific approach using preoperative 3D ultrasound liver volume to train a deep learning model for real-time identification of portal tree and branch structures. Our personalized AI model, validated on ex vivo swine livers, achieved superior precision (0.95) and recall (0.93) compared to surgeons, laying groundwork for precise vessel identification in ultrasound-based liver resection. Its adaptability and potential clinical impact promise to advance surgical interventions and improve patient care.</description>

      <title>Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient for Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have been effective in learning data priors for solving inverse problems. They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.</description>

      <title>FedStein: Enhancing Multi-Domain Federated Learning Through James-Stein Estimator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates data privacy by enabling collaborative in-situ training across decentralized clients. Despite its inherent advantages, FL faces significant challenges of performance and convergence when dealing with data that is not independently and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.). While previous research has primarily addressed the issue of skewed label distribution across clients, this study focuses on the less explored challenge of multi-domain FL, where client data originates from distinct domains with varying feature distributions. We introduce a novel method designed to address these challenges FedStein: Enhancing Multi-Domain Federated Learning Through the James-Stein Estimator. FedStein uniquely shares only the James-Stein (JS) estimates of batch normalization (BN) statistics across clients, while maintaining local BN parameters. The non-BN layer parameters are exchanged via standard FL techniques. Extensive experiments conducted across three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that FedStein surpasses existing methods such as FedAvg and FedBN, with accuracy improvements exceeding 14% in certain domains leading to enhanced domain generalization.

Abstract: AI-based systems possess distinctive characteristics and introduce challenges in quality evaluation at the same time. Consequently, ensuring and validating AI software quality is of critical importance. In this paper, we present an effective AI software functional testing model to address this challenge. Specifically, we first present a comprehensive literature review of previous work, covering key facets of AI software testing processes. We then introduce a 3D classification model to systematically evaluate the image-based text extraction AI function, as well as test coverage criteria and complexity. To evaluate the performance of our proposed AI software quality test, we propose four evaluation metrics to cover different aspects. Finally, based on the proposed framework and defined metrics, a mobile Optical Character Recognition (OCR) case study is presented to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and capability in assessing AI function quality.</description>

      <title>Dreamming User Multimodal Representation for Micro-Video Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of online micro-video platforms has underscored the necessity for advanced recommender systems to mitigate information overload and deliver tailored content. Despite advancements, accurately and promptly capturing dynamic user interests remains a formidable challenge. Inspired by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, which posits that different data modalities converge towards a shared statistical model of reality, we introduce DreamUMM (Dreaming User Multi-Modal Representation), a novel approach leveraging user historical behaviors to create real-time user representation in a multimoda space. DreamUMM employs a closed-form solution correlating user video preferences with multimodal similarity, hypothesizing that user interests can be effectively represented in a unified multimodal space. Additionally, we propose Candidate-DreamUMM for scenarios lacking recent user behavior data, inferring interests from candidate videos alone. Extensive online A/B tests demonstrate significant improvements in user engagement metrics, including active days and play count. The successful deployment of DreamUMM in two micro-video platforms with hundreds of millions of daily active users, illustrates its practical efficacy and scalability in personalized micro-video content delivery. Our work contributes to the ongoing exploration of representational convergence by providing empirical evidence supporting the potential for user interest representations to reside in a multimodal space.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Autonomous Navigation by Imaging Hidden Objects using Single-Photon LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust autonomous navigation in environments with limited visibility remains a critical challenge in robotics. We present a novel approach that leverages Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) sensing using single-photon LiDAR to improve visibility and enhance autonomous navigation. Our method enables mobile robots to "see around corners" by utilizing multi-bounce light information, effectively expanding their perceptual range without additional infrastructure. We propose a three-module pipeline: (1) Sensing, which captures multi-bounce histograms using SPAD-based LiDAR; (2) Perception, which estimates occupancy maps of hidden regions from these histograms using a convolutional neural network; and (3) Control, which allows a robot to follow safe paths based on the estimated occupancy. We evaluate our approach through simulations and real-world experiments on a mobile robot navigating an L-shaped corridor with hidden obstacles. Our work represents the first experimental demonstration of NLOS imaging for autonomous navigation, paving the way for safer and more efficient robotic systems operating in complex environments. We also contribute a novel dynamics-integrated transient rendering framework for simulating NLOS scenarios, facilitating future research in this domain.</description>

      <title>BodyShapeGPT: SMPL Body Shape Manipulation with LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI models provide a wide range of tools capable of performing complex tasks in a fraction of the time it would take a human. Among these, Large Language Models (LLMs) stand out for their ability to generate diverse texts, from literary narratives to specialized responses in different fields of knowledge. This paper explores the use of fine-tuned LLMs to identify physical descriptions of people, and subsequently create accurate representations of avatars using the SMPL-X model by inferring shape parameters. We demonstrate that LLMs can be trained to understand and manipulate the shape space of SMPL, allowing the control of 3D human shapes through natural language. This approach promises to improve human-machine interaction and opens new avenues for customization and simulation in virtual environments.</description>

      <title>GenSim2: Scaling Robot Data Generation with Multi-modal and Reasoning LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic simulation today remains challenging to scale up due to the human efforts required to create diverse simulation tasks and scenes. Simulation-trained policies also face scalability issues as many sim-to-real methods focus on a single task. To address these challenges, this work proposes GenSim2, a scalable framework that leverages coding LLMs with multi-modal and reasoning capabilities for complex and realistic simulation task creation, including long-horizon tasks with articulated objects. To automatically generate demonstration data for these tasks at scale, we propose planning and RL solvers that generalize within object categories. The pipeline can generate data for up to 100 articulated tasks with 200 objects and reduce the required human efforts. To utilize such data, we propose an effective multi-task language-conditioned policy architecture, dubbed proprioceptive point-cloud transformer (PPT), that learns from the generated demonstrations and exhibits strong sim-to-real zero-shot transfer. Combining the proposed pipeline and the policy architecture, we show a promising usage of GenSim2 that the generated data can be used for zero-shot transfer or co-train with real-world collected data, which enhances the policy performance by 20% compared with training exclusively on limited real data.</description>

      <title>Evidence-based Match-status-Aware Gait Recognition for Out-of-Gallery Gait Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08007v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing gait recognition methods typically identify individuals based on the similarity between probe and gallery samples. However, these methods often neglect the fact that the gallery may not contain identities corresponding to the probes, leading to incorrect recognition.To identify Out-of-Gallery (OOG) gait queries, we propose an Evidence-based Match-status-Aware Gait Recognition (EMA-GR) framework. Inspired by Evidential Deep Learning (EDL), EMA-GR is designed to quantify the uncertainty associated with the match status of recognition. Thus, EMA-GR identifies whether the probe has a counterpart in the gallery. Specifically, we adopt an evidence collector to gather match status evidence from a recognition result pair and parameterize a Dirichlet distribution over the gathered evidence, following the Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence (DST). We measure the uncertainty and predict the match status of the recognition results, and thus determine whether the probe is an OOG query.To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first attempt to tackle OOG queries in gait recognition. Moreover, EMA-GR is agnostic against gait recognition methods and improves the robustness against OOG queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets with OOG queries, and can also generalize well to other identity-retrieval tasks. Importantly, our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin, achieving a 51.26% improvement when the OOG query rate is around 50% on OUMVLP.</description>

      <title>Deepfake Detection: A Comprehensive Survey from the Reliability Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10881v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mushroomed Deepfake synthetic materials circulated on the internet have raised a profound social impact on politicians, celebrities, and individuals worldwide. In this survey, we provide a thorough review of the existing Deepfake detection studies from the reliability perspective. We identify three reliability-oriented research challenges in the current Deepfake detection domain: transferability, interpretability, and robustness. Moreover, while solutions have been frequently addressed regarding the three challenges, the general reliability of a detection model has been barely considered, leading to the lack of reliable evidence in real-life usages and even for prosecutions on Deepfake-related cases in court. We, therefore, introduce a model reliability study metric using statistical random sampling knowledge and the publicly available benchmark datasets to review the reliability of the existing detection models on arbitrary Deepfake candidate suspects. Case studies are further executed to justify the real-life Deepfake cases including different groups of victims with the help of the reliably qualified detection models as reviewed in this survey. Reviews and experiments on the existing approaches provide informative discussions and future research directions for Deepfake detection.</description>

      <title>Mapping Degeneration Meets Label Evolution: Learning Infrared Small Target Detection with Single Point Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect infrared small targets in a fully supervised manner has gained remarkable research interests in recent years, but is highly labor expensive since a large number of per-pixel annotations are required. To handle this problem, in this paper, we make the first attempt to achieve infrared small target detection with point-level supervision. Interestingly, during the training phase supervised by point labels, we discover that CNNs first learn to segment a cluster of pixels near the targets, and then gradually converge to predict groundtruth point labels. Motivated by this "mapping degeneration" phenomenon, we propose a label evolution framework named label evolution with single point supervision (LESPS) to progressively expand the point label by leveraging the intermediate predictions of CNNs. In this way, the network predictions can finally approximate the updated pseudo labels, and a pixel-level target mask can be obtained to train CNNs in an end-to-end manner. We conduct extensive experiments with insightful visualizations to validate the effectiveness of our method. Experimental results show that CNNs equipped with LESPS can well recover the target masks from corresponding point labels, {and can achieve over 70% and 95% of their fully supervised performance in terms of pixel-level intersection over union (IoU) and object-level probability of detection (Pd), respectively.

      <title>AURA : Automatic Mask Generator using Randomized Input Sampling for Object Removal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The objective of the image inpainting task is to fill missing regions of an image in a visually plausible way. Recently, deep-learning-based image inpainting networks have generated outstanding results, and some utilize their models as object removers by masking unwanted objects in an image. However, while trying to better remove objects using their networks, the previous works pay less attention to the importance of the input mask. In this paper, we focus on generating the input mask to better remove objects using the off-the-shelf image inpainting network. We propose an automatic mask generator inspired by the explainable AI (XAI) method, whose output can better remove objects than a semantic segmentation mask. The proposed method generates an importance map using randomly sampled input masks and quantitatively estimated scores of the completed images obtained from the random masks. The output mask is selected by a judge module among the candidate masks which are generated from the importance map. We design the judge module to quantitatively estimate the quality of the object removal results. In addition, we empirically find that the evaluation methods used in the previous works reporting object removal results are not appropriate for estimating the performance of an object remover. Therefore, we propose new evaluation metrics (FID$^*$ and U-IDS$^*$) to properly evaluate the quality of object removers. Experiments confirm that our method shows better performance in removing target class objects than the masks generated from the semantic segmentation maps, and the two proposed metrics make judgments consistent with humans.</description>

      <title>MA-FSAR: Multimodal Adaptation of CLIP for Few-Shot Action Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applying large-scale vision-language pre-trained models like CLIP to few-shot action recognition (FSAR) can significantly enhance both performance and efficiency. While several studies have recognized this advantage, most of them resort to full-parameter fine-tuning to make CLIP's visual encoder adapt to the FSAR data, which not only costs high computations but also overlooks the potential of the visual encoder to engage in temporal modeling and focus on targeted semantics directly. To tackle these issues, we introduce MA-FSAR, a framework that employs the Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) technique to enhance the CLIP visual encoder in terms of action-related temporal and semantic representations. Our solution involves a Fine-grained Multimodal Adaptation, which is different from the previous attempts of PEFT in regular action recognition. Specifically, we first insert a Global Temporal Adaptation that only receives the class token to capture global motion cues efficiently. Then these outputs integrate with visual tokens to enhance local temporal dynamics by a Local Multimodal Adaptation, which incorporates text features unique to the FSAR support set branch to highlight fine-grained semantics related to actions. In addition to these token-level designs, we propose a prototype-level text-guided construction module to further enrich the temporal and semantic characteristics of video prototypes. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance in various tasks using minor trainable parameters.</description>

      <title>MosaicFusion: Diffusion Models as Data Augmenters for Large Vocabulary Instance Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present MosaicFusion, a simple yet effective diffusion-based data augmentation approach for large vocabulary instance segmentation. Our method is training-free and does not rely on any label supervision. Two key designs enable us to employ an off-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion model as a useful dataset generator for object instances and mask annotations. First, we divide an image canvas into several regions and perform a single round of diffusion process to generate multiple instances simultaneously, conditioning on different text prompts. Second, we obtain corresponding instance masks by aggregating cross-attention maps associated with object prompts across layers and diffusion time steps, followed by simple thresholding and edge-aware refinement processing. Without bells and whistles, our MosaicFusion can produce a significant amount of synthetic labeled data for both rare and novel categories. Experimental results on the challenging LVIS long-tailed and open-vocabulary benchmarks demonstrate that MosaicFusion can significantly improve the performance of existing instance segmentation models, especially for rare and novel categories.

      <title>Resfusion: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Image Restoration Based on Prior Residual Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, research on denoising diffusion models has expanded its application to the field of image restoration. Traditional diffusion-based image restoration methods utilize degraded images as conditional input to effectively guide the reverse generation process, without modifying the original denoising diffusion process. However, since the degraded images already include low-frequency information, starting from Gaussian white noise will result in increased sampling steps. We propose Resfusion, a general framework that incorporates the residual term into the diffusion forward process, starting the reverse process directly from the noisy degraded images. The form of our inference process is consistent with the DDPM. We introduced a weighted residual noise, named resnoise, as the prediction target and explicitly provide the quantitative relationship between the residual term and the noise term in resnoise. By leveraging a smooth equivalence transformation, Resfusion determine the optimal acceleration step and maintains the integrity of existing noise schedules, unifying the training and inference processes. The experimental results demonstrate that Resfusion exhibits competitive performance on ISTD dataset, LOL dataset and Raindrop dataset with only five sampling steps. Furthermore, Resfusion can be easily applied to image generation and emerges with strong versatility. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/nkicsl/Resfusion.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Unsupervised Disentanglement of Anatomy and Geometry for Deep Groupwise Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a general Bayesian learning framework for multi-modal groupwise image registration. The method builds on probabilistic modelling of the image generative process, where the underlying common anatomy and geometric variations of the observed images are explicitly disentangled as latent variables. Therefore, groupwise image registration is achieved via hierarchical Bayesian inference. We propose a novel hierarchical variational auto-encoding architecture to realise the inference procedure of the latent variables, where the registration parameters can be explicitly estimated in a mathematically interpretable fashion. Remarkably, this new paradigm learns groupwise image registration in an unsupervised closed-loop self-reconstruction process, sparing the burden of designing complex image-based similarity measures. The computationally efficient disentangled network architecture is also inherently scalable and flexible, allowing for groupwise registration on large-scale image groups with variable sizes. Furthermore, the inferred structural representations from multi-modal images via disentanglement learning are capable of capturing the latent anatomy of the observations with visual semantics. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the proposed framework, including four different datasets from cardiac, brain, and abdominal medical images. The results have demonstrated the superiority of our method over conventional similarity-based approaches in terms of accuracy, efficiency, scalability, and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Finer: Investigating and Enhancing Fine-Grained Visual Concept Recognition in Large Vision Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-tuned Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have imbued the models with the ability to generate high-level, image-grounded explanations with ease. While such capability is largely attributed to the rich world knowledge contained within the Large Language Models (LLMs), our work reveals their shortcomings in fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) across six different benchmark settings. Most recent state-of-the-art LVLMs like LLaVa-1.5, InstructBLIP and GPT-4V not only severely deteriorate in terms of classification performance, e.g., average drop of 65.58 in EM for Stanford Dogs for LLaVA-1.5, but also struggle to generate an accurate explanation with detailed attributes based on the concept that appears within an input image despite their capability to generate holistic image-level descriptions. In-depth analyses show that instruction-tuned LVLMs exhibit modality gap, showing discrepancy when given textual and visual inputs that correspond to the same concept, preventing the image modality from leveraging the rich parametric knowledge within the LLMs. In an effort to further the community's endeavor in this direction, we propose a multiple granularity attribute-centric evaluation benchmark, Finer, which aims to establish a ground to evaluate LVLMs' fine-grained visual comprehension ability and provide significantly improved explainability.</description>

      <title>DiffSF: Diffusion Models for Scene Flow Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scene flow estimation is an essential ingredient for a variety of real-world applications, especially for autonomous agents, such as self-driving cars and robots. While recent scene flow estimation approaches achieve a reasonable accuracy, their applicability to real-world systems additionally benefits from a reliability measure. Aiming at improving accuracy while additionally providing an estimate for uncertainty, we propose DiffSF that combines transformer-based scene flow estimation with denoising diffusion models. In the diffusion process, the ground truth scene flow vector field is gradually perturbed by adding Gaussian noise. In the reverse process, starting from randomly sampled Gaussian noise, the scene flow vector field prediction is recovered by conditioning on a source and a target point cloud. We show that the diffusion process greatly increases the robustness of predictions compared to prior approaches resulting in state-of-the-art performance on standard scene flow estimation benchmarks. Moreover, by sampling multiple times with different initial states, the denoising process predicts multiple hypotheses, which enables measuring the output uncertainty, allowing our approach to detect a majority of the inaccurate predictions.

      <title>Mitigating Dialogue Hallucination for Large Vision Language Models via Adversarial Instruction Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mitigating hallucinations of Large Vision Language Models,(LVLMs) is crucial to enhance their reliability for general-purpose assistants. This paper shows that such hallucinations of LVLMs can be significantly exacerbated by preceding user-system dialogues. To precisely measure this, we first present an evaluation benchmark by extending popular multi-modal benchmark datasets with prepended hallucinatory dialogues powered by our novel Adversarial Question Generator (AQG), which can automatically generate image-related yet adversarial dialogues by adopting adversarial attacks on LVLMs. On our benchmark, the zero-shot performance of state-of-the-art LVLMs drops significantly for both the VQA and Captioning tasks. Next, we further reveal this hallucination is mainly due to the prediction bias toward preceding dialogues rather than visual content. To reduce this bias, we propose Adversarial Instruction Tuning (AIT) that robustly fine-tunes LVLMs against hallucinatory dialogues. Extensive experiments show our proposed approach successfully reduces dialogue hallucination while maintaining performance.</description>

      <title>Mora: Enabling Generalist Video Generation via A Multi-Agent Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-video generation has made significant strides, but replicating the capabilities of advanced systems like OpenAI Sora remains challenging due to their closed-source nature. Existing open-source methods struggle to achieve comparable performance, often hindered by ineffective agent collaboration and inadequate training data quality. In this paper, we introduce Mora, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages existing open-source modules to replicate Sora functionalities. We address these fundamental limitations by proposing three key techniques: (1) multi-agent fine-tuning with a self-modulation factor to enhance inter-agent coordination, (2) a data-free training strategy that uses large models to synthesize training data, and (3) a human-in-the-loop mechanism combined with multimodal large language models for data filtering to ensure high-quality training datasets. Our comprehensive experiments on six video generation tasks demonstrate that Mora achieves performance comparable to Sora on VBench, outperforming existing open-source methods across various tasks. Specifically, in the text-to-video generation task, Mora achieved a Video Quality score of 0.800, surpassing Sora 0.797 and outperforming all other baseline models across six key metrics. Additionally, in the image-to-video generation task, Mora achieved a perfect Dynamic Degree score of 1.00, demonstrating exceptional capability in enhancing motion realism and achieving higher Imaging Quality than Sora. These results highlight the potential of collaborative multi-agent systems and human-in-the-loop mechanisms in advancing text-to-video generation.

      <title>GaNI: Global and Near Field Illumination Aware Neural Inverse Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present GaNI, a Global and Near-field Illumination-aware neural inverse rendering technique that can reconstruct geometry, albedo, and roughness parameters from images of a scene captured with co-located light and camera. Existing inverse rendering techniques with co-located light-camera focus on single objects only, without modeling global illumination and near-field lighting more prominent in scenes with multiple objects. We introduce a system that solves this problem in two stages; we first reconstruct the geometry powered by neural volumetric rendering NeuS, followed by inverse neural radiosity that uses the previously predicted geometry to estimate albedo and roughness. However, such a naive combination fails and we propose multiple technical contributions that enable this two-stage approach. We observe that NeuS fails to handle near-field illumination and strong specular reflections from the flashlight in a scene. We propose to implicitly model the effects of near-field illumination and introduce a surface angle loss function to handle specular reflections. Similarly, we observe that invNeRad assumes constant illumination throughout the capture and cannot handle moving flashlights during capture. We propose a light position-aware radiance cache network and additional smoothness priors on roughness to reconstruct reflectance. Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that our method outperforms the existing co-located light-camera-based inverse rendering techniques. Our approach produces significantly better reflectance and slightly better geometry than capture strategies that do not require a dark room.</description>

      <title>ESREAL: Exploiting Semantic Reconstruction to Mitigate Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16167v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hallucinations in vision-language models pose a significant challenge to their reliability, particularly in the generation of long captions. Current methods fall short of accurately identifying and mitigating these hallucinations. To address this issue, we introduce ESREAL, a novel unsupervised learning framework designed to suppress the generation of hallucinations through accurate localization and penalization of hallucinated tokens. Initially, ESREAL creates a reconstructed image based on the generated caption and aligns its corresponding regions with those of the original image. This semantic reconstruction aids in identifying both the presence and type of token-level hallucinations within the generated caption. Subsequently, ESREAL computes token-level hallucination scores by assessing the semantic similarity of aligned regions based on the type of hallucination. Finally, ESREAL employs a proximal policy optimization algorithm, where it selectively penalizes hallucinated tokens according to their token-level hallucination scores. Our framework notably reduces hallucinations in LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and mPLUG-Owl2 by 32.81%, 27.08%, and 7.46% on the CHAIR metric. This improvement is achieved solely through signals derived from the image itself, without the need for any image-text pairs.</description>

      <title>AID: Attention Interpolation of Text-to-Image Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conditional diffusion models can create unseen images in various settings, aiding image interpolation. Interpolation in latent spaces is well-studied, but interpolation with specific conditions like text or poses is less understood. Simple approaches, such as linear interpolation in the space of conditions, often result in images that lack consistency, smoothness, and fidelity. To that end, we introduce a novel training-free technique named Attention Interpolation via Diffusion (AID). Our key contributions include 1) proposing an inner/outer interpolated attention layer; 2) fusing the interpolated attention with self-attention to boost fidelity; and 3) applying beta distribution to selection to increase smoothness. We also present a variant, Prompt-guided Attention Interpolation via Diffusion (PAID), that considers interpolation as a condition-dependent generative process. This method enables the creation of new images with greater consistency, smoothness, and efficiency, and offers control over the exact path of interpolation. Our approach demonstrates effectiveness for conceptual and spatial interpolation. Code and demo are available at https://github.com/QY-H00/attention-interpolation-diffusion.</description>

      <title>WcDT: World-centric Diffusion Transformer for Traffic Scene Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for autonomous driving trajectory generation by harnessing the complementary strengths of diffusion probabilistic models (a.k.a., diffusion models) and transformers. Our proposed framework, termed the "World-Centric Diffusion Transformer"(WcDT), optimizes the entire trajectory generation process, from feature extraction to model inference. To enhance the scene diversity and stochasticity, the historical trajectory data is first preprocessed into "Agent Move Statement" and encoded into latent space using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) enhanced with Diffusion with Transformer (DiT) blocks. Then, the latent features, historical trajectories, HD map features, and historical traffic signal information are fused with various transformer-based encoders that are used to enhance the interaction of agents with other elements in the traffic scene. The encoded traffic scenes are then decoded by a trajectory decoder to generate multimodal future trajectories. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed approach exhibits superior performance in generating both realistic and diverse trajectories, showing its potential for integration into automatic driving simulation systems. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/yangchen1997/WcDT}.</description>

      <title>Simple Drop-in LoRA Conditioning on Attention Layers Will Improve Your Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art diffusion models employ U-Net architectures containing convolutional and (qkv) self-attention layers. The U-Net processes images while being conditioned on the time embedding input for each sampling step and the class or caption embedding input corresponding to the desired conditional generation. Such conditioning involves scale-and-shift operations to the convolutional layers but does not directly affect the attention layers. While these standard architectural choices are certainly effective, not conditioning the attention layers feels arbitrary and potentially suboptimal. In this work, we show that simply adding LoRA conditioning to the attention layers without changing or tuning the other parts of the U-Net architecture improves the image generation quality. For example, a drop-in addition of LoRA conditioning to EDM diffusion model yields FID scores of 1.91/1.75 for unconditional and class-conditional CIFAR-10 generation, improving upon the baseline of 1.97/1.79.</description>

      <title>RobMOT: Robust 3D Multi-Object Tracking by Observational Noise and State Estimation Drift Mitigation on LiDAR PointCloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses limitations in recent 3D tracking-by-detection methods, focusing on identifying legitimate trajectories and addressing state estimation drift in Kalman filters. Current methods rely heavily on threshold-based filtering of false positive detections using detection scores to prevent ghost trajectories. However, this approach is inadequate for distant and partially occluded objects, where detection scores tend to drop, potentially leading to false positives exceeding the threshold. Additionally, the literature generally treats detections as precise localizations of objects. Our research reveals that noise in detections impacts localization information, causing trajectory drift for occluded objects and hindering recovery. To this end, we propose a novel online track validity mechanism that temporally distinguishes between legitimate and ghost tracks, along with a multi-stage observational gating process for incoming observations. This mechanism significantly improves tracking performance, with a $6.28\%$ in HOTA and a $17.87\%$ increase in MOTA. We also introduce a refinement to the Kalman filter that enhances noise mitigation in trajectory drift, leading to more robust state estimation for occluded objects. Our framework, RobMOT, outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including deep learning approaches, across various detectors, achieving up to a $4\%$ margin in HOTA and $6\%$ in MOTA. RobMOT excels under challenging conditions, such as prolonged occlusions and tracking distant objects, with up to a 59\% improvement in processing latency.</description>

      <title>Context and Geometry Aware Voxel Transformer for Semantic Scene Completion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-based Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained much attention due to its widespread applications in various 3D perception tasks. Existing sparse-to-dense approaches typically employ shared context-independent queries across various input images, which fails to capture distinctions among them as the focal regions of different inputs vary and may result in undirected feature aggregation of cross-attention. Additionally, the absence of depth information may lead to points projected onto the image plane sharing the same 2D position or similar sampling points in the feature map, resulting in depth ambiguity. In this paper, we present a novel context and geometry aware voxel transformer. It utilizes a context aware query generator to initialize context-dependent queries tailored to individual input images, effectively capturing their unique characteristics and aggregating information within the region of interest. Furthermore, it extend deformable cross-attention from 2D to 3D pixel space, enabling the differentiation of points with similar image coordinates based on their depth coordinates. Building upon this module, we introduce a neural network named CGFormer to achieve semantic scene completion. Simultaneously, CGFormer leverages multiple 3D representations (i.e., voxel and TPV) to boost the semantic and geometric representation abilities of the transformed 3D volume from both local and global perspectives. Experimental results demonstrate that CGFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, attaining a mIoU of 16.87 and 20.05, as well as an IoU of 45.99 and 48.07, respectively. Remarkably, CGFormer even outperforms approaches employing temporal images as inputs or much larger image backbone networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been effectively used for many computer vision tasks, including image classification. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach for zero-shot image classification using multimodal LLMs. By employing multimodal LLMs, we generate comprehensive textual representations from input images. These textual representations are then utilized to generate fixed-dimensional features in a cross-modal embedding space. Subsequently, these features are fused together to perform zero-shot classification using a linear classifier. Our method does not require prompt engineering for each dataset; instead, we use a single, straightforward, set of prompts across all datasets. We evaluated our method on several datasets, and our results demonstrate its remarkable effectiveness, surpassing benchmark accuracy on multiple datasets. On average, our method achieved an accuracy gain of 4.1 percentage points, with an increase of 6.8 percentage points on the ImageNet dataset, compared to prior methods. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal LLMs to enhance computer vision tasks such as zero-shot image classification, offering a significant improvement over traditional methods.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents Deformable Neural Vessel Representations (DeNVeR), an unsupervised approach for vessel segmentation in X-ray videos without annotated ground truth. DeNVeR uses optical flow and layer separation, enhancing segmentation accuracy and adaptability through test-time training. A key component of our research is the introduction of the XACV dataset, the first X-ray angiography coronary video dataset with high-quality, manually labeled segmentation ground truth. Our evaluation demonstrates that DeNVeR outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in vessel segmentation. This paper marks an advance in medical imaging, providing a robust, data-efficient tool for disease diagnosis and treatment planning and setting a new standard for future research in video vessel segmentation.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in generating naturalistic images from textual inputs, and demonstrate the capacity to learn and represent complex visual-semantic relationships. While these diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, the underlying mechanisms driving their performance are not yet fully accounted for, with many unanswered questions surrounding what they learn, how they represent visual-semantic relationships, and why they sometimes fail to generalize. Our work presents Diffusion Partial Information Decomposition (DiffusionPID), a novel technique that applies information-theoretic principles to decompose the input text prompt into its elementary components, enabling a detailed examination of how individual tokens and their interactions shape the generated image. We introduce a formal approach to analyze the uniqueness, redundancy, and synergy terms by applying PID to the denoising model at both the image and pixel level. This approach enables us to characterize how individual tokens and their interactions affect the model output. We first present a fine-grained analysis of characteristics utilized by the model to uniquely localize specific concepts, we then apply our approach in bias analysis and show it can recover gender and ethnicity biases. Finally, we use our method to visually characterize word ambiguity and similarity from the model's perspective and illustrate the efficacy of our method for prompt intervention. Our results show that PID is a potent tool for evaluating and diagnosing text-to-image diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Human Gaussians from Single-View Image</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we tackle the task of learning 3D human Gaussians from a single image, focusing on recovering detailed appearance and geometry including unobserved regions. We introduce a single-view generalizable Human Gaussian Model (HGM), which employs a novel generate-then-refine pipeline with the guidance from human body prior and diffusion prior. Our approach uses a ControlNet to refine rendered back-view images from coarse predicted human Gaussians, then uses the refined image along with the input image to reconstruct refined human Gaussians. To mitigate the potential generation of unrealistic human poses and shapes, we incorporate human priors from the SMPL-X model as a dual branch, propagating image features from the SMPL-X volume to the image Gaussians using sparse convolution and attention mechanisms. Given that the initial SMPL-X estimation might be inaccurate, we gradually refine it with our HGM model. We validate our approach on several publicly available datasets. Our method surpasses previous methods in both novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction. Our approach also exhibits strong generalization for cross-dataset evaluation and in-the-wild images.</description>

      <title>VCR: Visual Caption Restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Visual Caption Restoration (VCR), a novel vision-language task that challenges models to accurately restore partially obscured texts using pixel-level hints within images. This task stems from the observation that text embedded in images is intrinsically different from common visual elements and natural language due to the need to align the modalities of vision, text, and text embedded in images. While numerous works have integrated text embedded in images into visual question-answering tasks, approaches to these tasks generally rely on optical character recognition or masked language modeling, thus reducing the task to mainly text-based processing. However, text-based processing becomes ineffective in VCR as accurate text restoration depends on the combined information from provided images, context, and subtle cues from the tiny exposed areas of masked texts. We develop a pipeline to generate synthetic images for the VCR task using image-caption pairs, with adjustable caption visibility to control the task difficulty. With this pipeline, we construct a dataset for VCR called VCR-Wiki using images with captions from Wikipedia, comprising 2.11M English and 346K Chinese entities in both easy and hard split variants. Our results reveal that current vision language models significantly lag behind human performance in the VCR task, and merely fine-tuning the models on our dataset does not lead to notable improvements. We release VCR-Wiki and the data construction code to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Updating CLIP to Prefer Descriptions Over Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although CLIPScore is a powerful generic metric that captures the similarity between a text and an image, it fails to distinguish between a caption that is meant to complement the information in an image and a description that is meant to replace an image entirely, e.g., for accessibility. We address this shortcoming by updating the CLIP model with the Concadia dataset to assign higher scores to descriptions than captions using parameter efficient fine-tuning and a loss objective derived from work on causal interpretability. This model correlates with the judgements of blind and low-vision people while preserving transfer capabilities and has interpretable structure that sheds light on the caption--description distinction.</description>

      <title>Denoising as Adaptation: Noise-Space Domain Adaptation for Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although learning-based image restoration methods have made significant progress, they still struggle with limited generalization to real-world scenarios due to the substantial domain gap caused by training on synthetic data. Existing methods address this issue by improving data synthesis pipelines, estimating degradation kernels, employing deep internal learning, and performing domain adaptation and regularization. Previous domain adaptation methods have sought to bridge the domain gap by learning domain-invariant knowledge in either feature or pixel space. However, these techniques often struggle to extend to low-level vision tasks within a stable and compact framework. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform domain adaptation via the noise space using diffusion models. In particular, by leveraging the unique property of how auxiliary conditional inputs influence the multi-step denoising process, we derive a meaningful diffusion loss that guides the restoration model in progressively aligning both restored synthetic and real-world outputs with a target clean distribution. We refer to this method as denoising as adaptation. To prevent shortcuts during joint training, we present crucial strategies such as channel-shuffling layer and residual-swapping contrastive learning in the diffusion model. They implicitly blur the boundaries between conditioned synthetic and real data and prevent the reliance of the model on easily distinguishable features. Experimental results on three classical image restoration tasks, namely denoising, deblurring, and deraining, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>DiffIR2VR-Zero: Zero-Shot Video Restoration with Diffusion-based Image Restoration Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01519v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method for zero-shot video restoration using pre-trained image restoration diffusion models. Traditional video restoration methods often need retraining for different settings and struggle with limited generalization across various degradation types and datasets. Our approach uses a hierarchical token merging strategy for keyframes and local frames, combined with a hybrid correspondence mechanism that blends optical flow and feature-based nearest neighbor matching (latent merging). We show that our method not only achieves top performance in zero-shot video restoration but also significantly surpasses trained models in generalization across diverse datasets and extreme degradations (8$\times$ super-resolution and high-standard deviation video denoising). We present evidence through quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on various challenging datasets. Additionally, our technique works with any 2D restoration diffusion model, offering a versatile and powerful tool for video enhancement tasks without extensive retraining. This research leads to more efficient and widely applicable video restoration technologies, supporting advancements in fields that require high-quality video output.

      <title>Single-Image Shadow Removal Using Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shadow removal aims at restoring the image content within shadow regions, pursuing a uniform distribution of illumination that is consistent between shadow and non-shadow regions. {Comparing to other image restoration tasks, there are two unique challenges in shadow removal:} 1) The patterns of shadows are arbitrary, varied, and often have highly complex trace structures, making ``trace-less'' image recovery difficult. 2) The degradation caused by shadows is spatially non-uniform, resulting in inconsistencies in illumination and color between shadow and non-shadow areas. Recent developments in this field are primarily driven by deep learning-based solutions, employing a variety of learning strategies, network architectures, loss functions, and training data. Nevertheless, a thorough and insightful review of deep learning-based shadow removal techniques is still lacking. In this paper, we are the first to provide a comprehensive survey to cover various aspects ranging from technical details to applications. We highlight the major advancements in deep learning-based single-image shadow removal methods, thoroughly review previous research across various categories, and provide insights into the historical progression of these developments. Additionally, we summarize performance comparisons both quantitatively and qualitatively. Beyond the technical aspects of shadow removal methods, we also explore potential future directions for this field.</description>

      <title>TGIF: Text-Guided Inpainting Forgery Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital image manipulation has become increasingly accessible and realistic with the advent of generative AI technologies. Recent developments allow for text-guided inpainting, making sophisticated image edits possible with minimal effort. This poses new challenges for digital media forensics. For example, diffusion model-based approaches could either splice the inpainted region into the original image, or regenerate the entire image. In the latter case, traditional image forgery localization (IFL) methods typically fail. This paper introduces the Text-Guided Inpainting Forgery (TGIF) dataset, a comprehensive collection of images designed to support the training and evaluation of image forgery localization and synthetic image detection (SID) methods. The TGIF dataset includes approximately 75k forged images, originating from popular open-source and commercial methods, namely SD2, SDXL, and Adobe Firefly. We benchmark several state-of-the-art IFL and SID methods on TGIF. Whereas traditional IFL methods can detect spliced images, they fail to detect regenerated inpainted images. Moreover, traditional SID may detect the regenerated inpainted images to be fake, but cannot localize the inpainted area. Finally, both IFL and SID methods fail when exposed to stronger compression, while they are less robust to modern compression algorithms, such as WEBP. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the inefficiency of state-of-the-art detectors on local manipulations performed by modern generative approaches, and aspires to help with the development of more capable IFL and SID methods.

      <title>A Lightweight Modular Framework for Low-Cost Open-Vocabulary Object Detection Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Object detection is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, centered on recognizing objects within images, with diverse applications in areas like image analysis, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. Although existing methods have achieved great success, they are often constrained by a fixed vocabulary of objects. To overcome this limitation, approaches like MDETR have redefined object detection by incorporating region-level vision-language pre-training, enabling open-vocabulary object detectors. However, these methods are computationally heavy due to the simultaneous training of large models for both vision and language representations. To address this, we introduce a lightweight framework that significantly reduces the number of parameters while preserving, or even improving, performance. Our solution is applied to MDETR, resulting in the development of Lightweight MDETR (LightMDETR), an optimized version of MDETR designed to enhance computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. The core of our approach involves freezing the MDETR backbone and training only the Universal Projection module (UP), which bridges vision and language representations. A learnable modality token parameter allows the UP to seamlessly switch between modalities. Evaluations on tasks like phrase grounding, referring expression comprehension, and segmentation show that LightMDETR not only reduces computational costs but also outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy.</description>

      <title>T-FAKE: Synthesizing Thermal Images for Facial Landmarking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Facial analysis is a key component in a wide range of applications such as security, autonomous driving, entertainment, and healthcare. Despite the availability of various facial RGB datasets, the thermal modality, which plays a crucial role in life sciences, medicine, and biometrics, has been largely overlooked. To address this gap, we introduce the T-FAKE dataset, a new large-scale synthetic thermal dataset with sparse and dense landmarks. To facilitate the creation of the dataset, we propose a novel RGB2Thermal loss function, which enables the transfer of thermal style to RGB faces. By utilizing the Wasserstein distance between thermal and RGB patches and the statistical analysis of clinical temperature distributions on faces, we ensure that the generated thermal images closely resemble real samples. Using RGB2Thermal style transfer based on our RGB2Thermal loss function, we create the T-FAKE dataset, a large-scale synthetic thermal dataset of faces. Leveraging our novel T-FAKE dataset, probabilistic landmark prediction, and label adaptation networks, we demonstrate significant improvements in landmark detection methods on thermal images across different landmark conventions. Our models show excellent performance with both sparse 70-point landmarks and dense 478-point landmark annotations. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/phflot/tfake.</description>

      <title>Qihoo-T2X: An Efficient Proxy-Tokenized Diffusion Transformer for Text-to-Any-Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global self-attention mechanism in diffusion transformers involves redundant computation due to the sparse and redundant nature of visual information, and the attention map of tokens within a spatial window shows significant similarity. To address this redundancy, we propose the Proxy-Tokenized Diffusion Transformer (PT-DiT), which employs sparse representative token attention (where the number of representative tokens is much smaller than the total number of tokens) to model global visual information efficiently. Specifically, within each transformer block, we compute an averaging token from each spatial-temporal window to serve as a proxy token for that region. The global semantics are captured through the self-attention of these proxy tokens and then injected into all latent tokens via cross-attention. Simultaneously, we introduce window and shift window attention to address the limitations in detail modeling caused by the sparse attention mechanism. Building on the well-designed PT-DiT, we further develop the Qihoo-T2X family, which includes a variety of models for T2I, T2V, and T2MV tasks. Experimental results show that PT-DiT achieves competitive performance while reducing the computational complexity in both image and video generation tasks (e.g., a 49% reduction compared to DiT and a 34% reduction compared to PixArt-$\alpha$). The visual exhibition and source code of Qihoo-T2X is available at https://360cvgroup.github.io/Qihoo-T2X/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies in text-to-image customization show great success in generating personalized object variants given several images of a subject. While existing methods focus more on preserving the identity of the subject, they often fall short of controlling the spatial relationship between objects. In this work, we introduce GroundingBooth, a framework that achieves zero-shot instance-level spatial grounding on both foreground subjects and background objects in the text-to-image customization task. Our proposed text-image grounding module and masked cross-attention layer allow us to generate personalized images with both accurate layout alignment and identity preservation while maintaining text-image coherence. With such layout control, our model inherently enables the customization of multiple subjects at once. Our model is evaluated on both layout-guided image synthesis and reference-based customization tasks, showing strong results compared to existing methods. Our work is the first work to achieve a joint grounding on both subject-driven foreground generation and text-driven background generation.</description>

      <title>Infrared Small Target Detection in Satellite Videos: A New Dataset and A Novel Recurrent Feature Refinement Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-frame infrared small target (MIRST) detection in satellite videos is a long-standing, fundamental yet challenging task for decades, and the challenges can be summarized as: First, extremely small target size, highly complex clutters &amp; noises, various satellite motions result in limited feature representation, high false alarms, and difficult motion analyses. Second, the lack of large-scale public available MIRST dataset in satellite videos greatly hinders the algorithm development. To address the aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we first build a large-scale dataset for MIRST detection in satellite videos (namely IRSatVideo-LEO), and then develop a recurrent feature refinement (RFR) framework as the baseline method. Specifically, IRSatVideo-LEO is a semi-simulated dataset with synthesized satellite motion, target appearance, trajectory and intensity, which can provide a standard toolbox for satellite video generation and a reliable evaluation platform to facilitate the algorithm development. For baseline method, RFR is proposed to be equipped with existing powerful CNN-based methods for long-term temporal dependency exploitation and integrated motion compensation &amp; MIRST detection. Specifically, a pyramid deformable alignment (PDA) module and a temporal-spatial-frequency modulation (TSFM) module are proposed to achieve effective and efficient feature alignment, propagation, aggregation and refinement. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our scheme. The comparative results show that ResUNet equipped with RFR outperforms the state-of-the-art MIRST detection methods. Dataset and code are released at https://github.com/XinyiYing/RFR.</description>

      <title>ERIC: Estimating Rainfall with Commodity Doorbell Camera for Precision Residential Irrigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art residential irrigation systems, such as WaterMyYard, rely on rainfall data from nearby weather stations to adjust irrigation amounts. However, the accuracy of rainfall data is compromised by the limited spatial resolution of rain gauges and the significant variability of hyperlocal rainfall, leading to substantial water waste. To improve irrigation efficiency, we developed a cost-effective irrigation system, dubbed ERIC, which employs machine learning models to estimate rainfall from commodity doorbell camera footage and optimizes irrigation schedules without human intervention. Specifically, we: a) designed novel visual and audio features with lightweight neural network models to infer rainfall from the camera at the edge, preserving user privacy; b) built a complete end-to-end irrigation system on Raspberry Pi 4, costing only \$75. We deployed the system across five locations (collecting over 750 hours of video) with varying backgrounds and light conditions. Comprehensive evaluation validates that ERIC achieves state-of-the-art rainfall estimation performance ($\sim$ 5mm/day), saving 9,112 gallons/month of water, translating to \$28.56/month in utility savings.

      <description>arXiv:2409.17924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Challenging to capture, and challenging to display on a cellphone screen, the panorama paradoxically remains both a staple and underused feature of modern mobile camera applications. In this work we address both of these challenges with a spherical neural light field model for implicit panoramic image stitching and re-rendering; able to accommodate for depth parallax, view-dependent lighting, and local scene motion and color changes during capture. Fit during test-time to an arbitrary path panoramic video capture -- vertical, horizontal, random-walk -- these neural light spheres jointly estimate the camera path and a high-resolution scene reconstruction to produce novel wide field-of-view projections of the environment. Our single-layer model avoids expensive volumetric sampling, and decomposes the scene into compact view-dependent ray offset and color components, with a total model size of 80 MB per scene, and real-time (50 FPS) rendering at 1080p resolution. We demonstrate improved reconstruction quality over traditional image stitching and radiance field methods, with significantly higher tolerance to scene motion and non-ideal capture settings.</description>

      <title>PCEvE: Part Contribution Evaluation Based Model Explanation for Human Figure Drawing Assessment and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For automatic human figure drawing (HFD) assessment tasks, such as diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using HFD images, the clarity and explainability of a model decision are crucial. Existing pixel-level attribution-based explainable AI (XAI) approaches demand considerable effort from users to interpret the semantic information of a region in an image, which can be often time-consuming and impractical. To overcome this challenge, we propose a part contribution evaluation based model explanation (PCEvE) framework. On top of the part detection, we measure the Shapley Value of each individual part to evaluate the contribution to a model decision. Unlike existing attribution-based XAI approaches, the PCEvE provides a straightforward explanation of a model decision, i.e., a part contribution histogram. Furthermore, the PCEvE expands the scope of explanations beyond the conventional sample-level to include class-level and task-level insights, offering a richer, more comprehensive understanding of model behavior. We rigorously validate the PCEvE via extensive experiments on multiple HFD assessment datasets. Also, we sanity-check the proposed method with a set of controlled experiments. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility and applicability of our method to other domains by applying it to a photo-realistic dataset, the Stanford Cars.</description>

      <title>Multi-hypotheses Conditioned Point Cloud Diffusion for 3D Human Reconstruction from Occluded Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D human shape reconstruction under severe occlusion due to human-object or human-human interaction is a challenging problem. Parametric models i.e., SMPL(-X), which are based on the statistics across human shapes, can represent whole human body shapes but are limited to minimally-clothed human shapes. Implicit-function-based methods extract features from the parametric models to employ prior knowledge of human bodies and can capture geometric details such as clothing and hair. However, they often struggle to handle misaligned parametric models and inpaint occluded regions given a single RGB image. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline, MHCDIFF, Multi-hypotheses Conditioned Point Cloud Diffusion, composed of point cloud diffusion conditioned on probabilistic distributions for pixel-aligned detailed 3D human reconstruction under occlusion. Compared to previous implicit-function-based methods, the point cloud diffusion model can capture the global consistent features to generate the occluded regions, and the denoising process corrects the misaligned SMPL meshes. The core of MHCDIFF is extracting local features from multiple hypothesized SMPL(-X) meshes and aggregating the set of features to condition the diffusion model. In the experiments on CAPE and MultiHuman datasets, the proposed method outperforms various SOTA methods based on SMPL, implicit functions, point cloud diffusion, and their combined, under synthetic and real occlusions.

      <title>Explainable Artifacts for Synthetic Western Blot Source Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have enabled generative models to produce synthetic scientific images that are indistinguishable from pristine ones, posing a challenge even for expert scientists habituated to working with such content. When exploited by organizations known as paper mills, which systematically generate fraudulent articles, these technologies can significantly contribute to the spread of misinformation about ungrounded science, potentially undermining trust in scientific research. While previous studies have explored black-box solutions, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, for identifying synthetic content, only some have addressed the challenge of generalizing across different models and providing insight into the artifacts in synthetic images that inform the detection process. This study aims to identify explainable artifacts generated by state-of-the-art generative models (e.g., Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models) and leverage them for open-set identification and source attribution (i.e., pointing to the model that created the image).</description>

      <title>Applying the Lower-Biased Teacher Model in Semi-Supervised Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present the Lower Biased Teacher model, an enhancement of the Unbiased Teacher model, specifically tailored for semi-supervised object detection tasks. The primary innovation of this model is the integration of a localization loss into the teacher model, which significantly improves the accuracy of pseudo-label generation. By addressing key issues such as class imbalance and the precision of bounding boxes, the Lower Biased Teacher model demonstrates superior performance in object detection tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple semi-supervised object detection datasets show that the Lower Biased Teacher model not only reduces the pseudo-labeling bias caused by class imbalances but also mitigates errors arising from incorrect bounding boxes. As a result, the model achieves higher mAP scores and more reliable detection outcomes compared to existing methods. This research underscores the importance of accurate pseudo-label generation and provides a robust framework for future advancements in semi-supervised learning for object detection.</description>

      <title>A large-scale operational study of fingerprint quality and demographics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Even though a few initial works have shown on small sets of data some level of bias in the performance of fingerprint recognition technology with respect to certain demographic groups, there is still not sufficient evidence to understand the impact that certain factors such as gender, age or finger-type may have on fingerprint quality and, in turn, also on fingerprint matching accuracy. The present work addresses this still under researched topic, on a large-scale database of operational data containing 10-print impressions of almost 16,000 subjects. The results reached provide further insight into the dependency of fingerprint quality and demographics, and show that there in fact exists a certain degree of performance variability in fingerprint-based recognition systems for different segments of the population. Based on the experimental evaluation, the work points out new observations based on data-driven evidence, provides plausible hypotheses to explain such observations, and concludes with potential follow-up actions that can help to reduce the observed fingerprint quality differences. This way, the current paper can be considered as a contribution to further increase the algorithmic fairness and equality of biometric technology.</description>

      <title>HarmoniCa: Harmonizing Training and Inference for Better Feature Cache in Diffusion Transformer Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have gained prominence for outstanding scalability and extraordinary performance in generative tasks. However, their considerable inference costs impede practical deployment. The feature cache mechanism, which involves storing and retrieving redundant computations across timesteps, holds promise for reducing per-step inference time in diffusion models. Most existing caching methods for DiT are manually designed. Although the learning-based approach attempts to optimize strategies adaptively, it suffers from discrepancies between training and inference, which hampers both the performance and acceleration ratio. Upon detailed analysis, we pinpoint that these discrepancies primarily stem from two aspects: (1) Prior Timestep Disregard, where training ignores the effect of cache usage at earlier timesteps, and (2) Objective Mismatch, where the training target (align predicted noise in each timestep) deviates from the goal of inference (generate the high-quality image). To alleviate these discrepancies, we propose HarmoniCa, a novel method that Harmonizes training and inference with a novel learning-based Caching framework built upon Step-Wise Denoising Training (SDT) and Image Error Proxy-Guided Objective (IEPO). Compared to the traditional training paradigm, the newly proposed SDT maintains the continuity of the denoising process, enabling the model to leverage information from prior timesteps during training, similar to the way it operates during inference. Furthermore, we design IEPO, which integrates an efficient proxy mechanism to approximate the final image error caused by reusing the cached feature. Therefore, IEPO helps balance final image quality and cache utilization, resolving the issue of training that only considers the impact of cache usage on the predicted output at each timestep.</description>

      <title>EVER: Exact Volumetric Ellipsoid Rendering for Real-time View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Exact Volumetric Ellipsoid Rendering (EVER), a method for real-time differentiable emission-only volume rendering. Unlike recent rasterization based approach by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), our primitive based representation allows for exact volume rendering, rather than alpha compositing 3D Gaussian billboards. As such, unlike 3DGS our formulation does not suffer from popping artifacts and view dependent density, but still achieves frame rates of $\sim\!30$ FPS at 720p on an NVIDIA RTX4090. Since our approach is built upon ray tracing it enables effects such as defocus blur and camera distortion (e.g. such as from fisheye cameras), which are difficult to achieve by rasterization. We show that our method is more accurate with fewer blending issues than 3DGS and follow-up work on view-consistent rendering, especially on the challenging large-scale scenes from the Zip-NeRF dataset where it achieves sharpest results among real-time techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a semi-supervised fine-tuning approach designed to improve the performance of pre-trained foundation models on downstream tasks with limited labeled data. By leveraging content-style decomposition within an information-theoretic framework, our method enhances the latent representations of pre-trained vision foundation models, aligning them more effectively with specific task objectives and addressing the problem of distribution shift. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets, including MNIST, its augmented variations (with yellow and white stripes), CIFAR-10, SVHN, and GalaxyMNIST. The experiments show improvements over supervised finetuning baseline of pre-trained models, particularly in low-labeled data regimes, across both frozen and trainable backbones for the majority of the tested datasets.</description>

      <title>SCA: Highly Efficient Semantic-Consistent Unrestricted Adversarial Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial attacks typically manipulate the semantic content of an image (e.g., color or texture) to create adversarial examples that are both effective and photorealistic. Recent works have utilized the diffusion inversion process to map images into a latent space, where high-level semantics are manipulated by introducing perturbations. However, they often results in substantial semantic distortions in the denoised output and suffers from low efficiency. In this study, we propose a novel framework called Semantic-Consistent Unrestricted Adversarial Attacks (SCA), which employs an inversion method to extract edit-friendly noise maps and utilizes Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to provide semantic guidance throughout the process. Under the condition of rich semantic information provided by MLLM, we perform the DDPM denoising process of each step using a series of edit-friendly noise maps, and leverage DPM Solver++ to accelerate this process, enabling efficient sampling with semantic consistency. Compared to existing methods, our framework enables the efficient generation of adversarial examples that exhibit minimal discernible semantic changes. Consequently, we for the first time introduce Semantic-Consistent Adversarial Examples (SCAE). Extensive experiments and visualizations have demonstrated the high efficiency of SCA, particularly in being on average 12 times faster than the state-of-the-art attacks.

      <title>Decoupling Layout from Glyph in Online Chinese Handwriting Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text plays a crucial role in the transmission of human civilization, and teaching machines to generate online handwritten text in various styles presents an interesting and significant challenge. However, most prior work has concentrated on generating individual Chinese fonts, leaving {complete text line generation largely unexplored}. In this paper, we identify that text lines can naturally be divided into two components: layout and glyphs. Based on this division, we designed a text line layout generator coupled with a diffusion-based stylized font synthesizer to address this challenge hierarchically. More concretely, the layout generator performs in-context-like learning based on the text content and the provided style references to generate positions for each glyph autoregressively. Meanwhile, the font synthesizer which consists of a character embedding dictionary, a multi-scale calligraphy style encoder, and a 1D U-Net based diffusion denoiser will generate each font on its position while imitating the calligraphy style extracted from the given style references. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on the CASIA-OLHWDB demonstrate that our method is capable of generating structurally correct and indistinguishable imitation samples.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Potential of the Diffusion Model in Few-shot Semantic Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Diffusion Model has not only garnered noteworthy achievements in the realm of image generation but has also demonstrated its potential as an effective pretraining method utilizing unlabeled data. Drawing from the extensive potential unveiled by the Diffusion Model in both semantic correspondence and open vocabulary segmentation, our work initiates an investigation into employing the Latent Diffusion Model for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation. Recently, inspired by the in-context learning ability of large language models, Few-shot Semantic Segmentation has evolved into In-context Segmentation tasks, morphing into a crucial element in assessing generalist segmentation models. In this context, we concentrate on Few-shot Semantic Segmentation, establishing a solid foundation for the future development of a Diffusion-based generalist model for segmentation. Our initial focus lies in understanding how to facilitate interaction between the query image and the support image, resulting in the proposal of a KV fusion method within the self-attention framework. Subsequently, we delve deeper into optimizing the infusion of information from the support mask and simultaneously re-evaluating how to provide reasonable supervision from the query mask. Based on our analysis, we establish a simple and effective framework named DiffewS, maximally retaining the original Latent Diffusion Model's generative framework and effectively utilizing the pre-training prior. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the previous SOTA models in multiple settings.</description>

      <title>Learning 3D Perception from Others' Predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection in real-world environments requires a huge amount of annotated data with high quality. Acquiring such data is tedious and expensive, and often needs repeated effort when a new sensor is adopted or when the detector is deployed in a new environment. We investigate a new scenario to construct 3D object detectors: learning from the predictions of a nearby unit that is equipped with an accurate detector. For example, when a self-driving car enters a new area, it may learn from other traffic participants whose detectors have been optimized for that area. This setting is label-efficient, sensor-agnostic, and communication-efficient: nearby units only need to share the predictions with the ego agent (e.g., car). Naively using the received predictions as ground-truths to train the detector for the ego car, however, leads to inferior performance. We systematically study the problem and identify viewpoint mismatches and mislocalization (due to synchronization and GPS errors) as the main causes, which unavoidably result in false positives, false negatives, and inaccurate pseudo labels. We propose a distance-based curriculum, first learning from closer units with similar viewpoints and subsequently improving the quality of other units' predictions via self-training. We further demonstrate that an effective pseudo label refinement module can be trained with a handful of annotated data, largely reducing the data quantity necessary to train an object detector. We validate our approach on the recently released real-world collaborative driving dataset, using reference cars' predictions as pseudo labels for the ego car. Extensive experiments including several scenarios (e.g., different sensors, detectors, and domains) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach toward label-efficient learning of 3D perception from other units' predictions.</description>

Abstract: The development of video large multimodal models (LMMs) has been hindered by the difficulty of curating large amounts of high-quality raw data from the web. To address this, we propose an alternative approach by creating a high-quality synthetic dataset specifically for video instruction-following, namely LLaVA-Video-178K. This dataset includes key tasks such as detailed captioning, open-ended question-answering (QA), and multiple-choice QA. By training on this dataset, in combination with existing visual instruction tuning data, we introduce LLaVA-Video, a new video LMM. Our experiments demonstrate that LLaVA-Video achieves strong performance across various video benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of our dataset. We plan to release the dataset, its generation pipeline, and the model checkpoints.</description>

      <title>AVG-LLaVA: A Large Multimodal Model with Adaptive Visual Granularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, when dealing with high-resolution images, dominant LMMs usually divide them into multiple local images and one global image, which will lead to a large number of visual tokens. In this work, we introduce AVG-LLaVA, an LMM that can adaptively select the appropriate visual granularity based on the input image and instruction. This approach not only reduces the number of visual tokens and speeds up inference, but also improves the overall model performance. Specifically, we introduce the following modules based on LLaVA-NeXT: (a) a visual granularity scaler that includes multiple pooling layers to obtain visual tokens with different granularities; (b) a visual granularity router, which includes a Transformer layer, an MLP layer, and a voter layer, used to select the appropriate visual granularity based on the image and instruction. Furthermore, we propose RGLF, a novel training paradigm that aims at aligning the granularity predicted by the router with the preferences of the LMM, without the need for additional manually annotated data. Extensive experiments and analysis show that AVG-LLaVA achieves superior performance across 11 benchmarks, as well as significantly reduces the number of visual tokens and speeds up inference (e.g., an 85.3% reduction in visual tokens and a 2.53$\times$ increase in inference speed on the AI2D benchmark).</description>

Abstract: Physicists routinely need probabilistic models for a number of tasks such as parameter inference or the generation of new realizations of a field. Establishing such models for highly non-Gaussian fields is a challenge, especially when the number of samples is limited. In this paper, we introduce scattering spectra models for stationary fields and we show that they provide accurate and robust statistical descriptions of a wide range of fields encountered in physics. These models are based on covariances of scattering coefficients, i.e. wavelet decomposition of a field coupled with a point-wise modulus. After introducing useful dimension reductions taking advantage of the regularity of a field under rotation and scaling, we validate these models on various multi-scale physical fields and demonstrate that they reproduce standard statistics, including spatial moments up to 4th order. These scattering spectra provide us with a low-dimensional structured representation that captures key properties encountered in a wide range of physical fields. These generic models can be used for data exploration, classification, parameter inference, symmetry detection, and component separation.</description>

      <title>MonoVisual3DFilter: 3D tomatoes' localisation with monocular cameras using histogram filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Performing tasks in agriculture, such as fruit monitoring or harvesting, requires perceiving the objects' spatial position. RGB-D cameras are limited under open-field environments due to lightning interferences. So, in this study, we state to answer the research question: "How can we use and control monocular sensors to perceive objects' position in the 3D task space?" Towards this aim, we approached histogram filters (Bayesian discrete filters) to estimate the position of tomatoes in the tomato plant through the algorithm MonoVisual3DFilter. Two kernel filters were studied: the square kernel and the Gaussian kernel. The implemented algorithm was essayed in simulation, with and without Gaussian noise and random noise, and in a testbed at laboratory conditions. The algorithm reported a mean absolute error lower than 10 mm in simulation and 20 mm in the testbed at laboratory conditions with an assessing distance of about 0.5 m. So, the results are viable for real environments and should be improved at closer distances.</description>

      <title>MITS-GAN: Safeguarding Medical Imaging from Tampering with Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The progress in generative models, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), opened new possibilities for image generation but raised concerns about potential malicious uses, especially in sensitive areas like medical imaging. This study introduces MITS-GAN, a novel approach to prevent tampering in medical images, with a specific focus on CT scans. The approach disrupts the output of the attacker's CT-GAN architecture by introducing finely tuned perturbations that are imperceptible to the human eye. Specifically, the proposed approach involves the introduction of appropriate Gaussian noise to the input as a protective measure against various attacks. Our method aims to enhance tamper resistance, comparing favorably to existing techniques. Experimental results on a CT scan demonstrate MITS-GAN's superior performance, emphasizing its ability to generate tamper-resistant images with negligible artifacts. As image tampering in medical domains poses life-threatening risks, our proactive approach contributes to the responsible and ethical use of generative models. This work provides a foundation for future research in countering cyber threats in medical imaging. Models and codes are publicly available on https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/MITS-GAN-2024/.</description>

      <title>Statistical Test on Diffusion Model-based Anomaly Detection by Selective Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in AI image generation, particularly diffusion models, have progressed rapidly. However, the absence of an established framework for quantifying the reliability of AI-generated images hinders their use in critical decision-making tasks, such as medical image diagnosis. In this study, we address the task of detecting anomalous regions in medical images using diffusion models and propose a statistical method to quantify the reliability of the detected anomalies. The core concept of our method involves a selective inference framework, wherein statistical tests are conducted under the condition that the images are produced by a diffusion model. With our approach, the statistical significance of anomaly detection results can be quantified in the form of a $p$-value, enabling decision-making with controlled error rates, as is standard in medical practice. We demonstrate the theoretical soundness and practical effectiveness of our statistical test through numerical experiments on both synthetic and brain image datasets.</description>

      <title>CommVQA: Situating Visual Question Answering in Communicative Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current visual question answering (VQA) models tend to be trained and evaluated on image-question pairs in isolation. However, the questions people ask are dependent on their informational needs and prior knowledge about the image content. To evaluate how situating images within naturalistic contexts shapes visual questions, we introduce CommVQA, a VQA dataset consisting of images, image descriptions, real-world communicative scenarios where the image might appear (e.g., a travel website), and follow-up questions and answers conditioned on the scenario and description. CommVQA, which contains 1000 images and 8,949 question-answer pairs, poses a challenge for current models. Error analyses and a human-subjects study suggest that generated answers still contain high rates of hallucinations, fail to fittingly address unanswerable questions, and don't suitably reflect contextual information. Overall, we show that access to contextual information is essential for solving CommVQA, leading to the highest performing VQA model and highlighting the relevance of situating systems within communicative scenarios.</description>

      <title>Data-centric Prediction Explanation via Kernelized Stein Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing example-based prediction explanation methods often bridge test and training data points through the model's parameters or latent representations. While these methods offer clues to the causes of model predictions, they often exhibit innate shortcomings, such as incurring significant computational overhead or producing coarse-grained explanations. This paper presents a Highly-precise and Data-centric Explan}ation (HD-Explain) prediction explanation method that exploits properties of Kernelized Stein Discrepancy (KSD). Specifically, the KSD uniquely defines a parameterized kernel function for a trained model that encodes model-dependent data correlation. By leveraging the kernel function, one can identify training samples that provide the best predictive support to a test point efficiently. We conducted thorough analyses and experiments across multiple classification domains, where we show that HD-Explain outperforms existing methods from various aspects, including 1) preciseness (fine-grained explanation), 2) consistency, and 3) computation efficiency, leading to a surprisingly simple, effective, and robust prediction explanation solution.</description>

      <title>Visually Descriptive Language Model for Vector Graphics Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06479v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements, large multimodal models (LMMs) still struggle to bridge the gap between low-level visual perception -- focusing on shapes, sizes, and layouts -- and high-level language reasoning, such as semantics and logic. This limitation is evident in tasks that require precise visual perception, like comparing geometric properties or solving visual reasoning problems. To study this failure mode, we focus on vector graphics -- images composed of 2D objects and shapes, prevalent in LMM-based tasks in web, design, and OS environments. We identify two key research questions: how can we enable precise visual perception, and how can we facilitate high-level reasoning based on such low-level perceptions? To capture fine visual details, we use Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for accurate encoding of visual scenes. However, SVGs are not readily interpretable by LMMs in a zero-shot manner. To tackle this, we propose the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM), which introduces a Primal Visual Description (PVD) as an intermediate textual representation. PVD translates SVGs into a text-based abstraction consisting of primitive attributes (e.g., shape, position, measurement) and their corresponding values. PVD can be learned using task-agnostic synthesized data and represents visual primitives that are universal across vector graphics. This abstraction is more structured, allowing for direct interpretation by foundation models for zero-shot generalization. Without human-annotated data, empirical results show that VDLM significantly improves state-of-the-art LMMs like GPT-4o on various multimodal perception and reasoning tasks. Extensive analyses of VDLM show improved interpretability due to its disentangled perception and reasoning. We also demonstrate a positive correlation between PVD quality and task performance.

      <title>VALOR-EVAL: Holistic Coverage and Faithfulness Evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13874v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from hallucination issues, wherein the models generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect outputs, undermining their reliability. A comprehensive quantitative evaluation is necessary to identify and understand the extent of hallucinations in these models. However, existing benchmarks are often limited in scope, focusing mainly on object hallucinations. Furthermore, current evaluation methods struggle to effectively address the subtle semantic distinctions between model outputs and reference data, as well as the balance between hallucination and informativeness. To address these issues, we introduce a multi-dimensional benchmark covering objects, attributes, and relations, with challenging images selected based on associative biases. Moreover, we propose a large language model (LLM)-based two-stage evaluation framework that generalizes the popular CHAIR metric and incorporates both faithfulness and coverage into the evaluation. Experiments on 10 established LVLMs demonstrate that our evaluation metric is more comprehensive and better correlated with humans than existing work when evaluating on our challenging human-annotated benchmark dataset. Our work also highlights the critical balance between faithfulness and coverage of model outputs, and encourages future works to address hallucinations in LVLMs while keeping their outputs informative.</description>

      <title>Editable Concept Bottleneck Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have garnered much attention for their ability to elucidate the prediction process through a human-understandable concept layer. However, most previous studies focused on cases where the data, including concepts, are clean. In many scenarios, we always need to remove/insert some training data or new concepts from trained CBMs due to different reasons, such as privacy concerns, data mislabelling, spurious concepts, and concept annotation errors. Thus, the challenge of deriving efficient editable CBMs without retraining from scratch persists, particularly in large-scale applications. To address these challenges, we propose Editable Concept Bottleneck Models (ECBMs). Specifically, ECBMs support three different levels of data removal: concept-label-level, concept-level, and data-level. ECBMs enjoy mathematically rigorous closed-form approximations derived from influence functions that obviate the need for re-training. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our ECBMs, affirming their adaptability within the realm of CBMs.</description>

      <title>Grounding Continuous Representations in Geometry: Equivariant Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05753v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conditional Neural Fields (CNFs) are increasingly being leveraged as continuous signal representations, by associating each data-sample with a latent variable that conditions a shared backbone Neural Field (NeF) to reconstruct the sample. However, existing CNF architectures face limitations when using this latent downstream in tasks requiring fine grained geometric reasoning, such as classification and segmentation. We posit that this results from lack of explicit modelling of geometric information (e.g. locality in the signal or the orientation of a feature) in the latent space of CNFs. As such, we propose Equivariant Neural Fields (ENFs), a novel CNF architecture which uses a geometry-informed cross-attention to condition the NeF on a geometric variable, a latent point cloud of features, that enables an equivariant decoding from latent to field. We show that this approach induces a steerability property by which both field and latent are grounded in geometry and amenable to transformation laws: if the field transforms, the latent representation transforms accordingly - and vice versa. Crucially, this equivariance relation ensures that the latent is capable of (1) representing geometric patterns faitfhully, allowing for geometric reasoning in latent space, (2) weight-sharing over similar local patterns, allowing for efficient learning of datasets of fields. We validate these main properties in a range of tasks including classification, segmentation, forecasting and reconstruction, showing clear improvement over baselines with a geometry-free latent space.</description>

      <title>VDebugger: Harnessing Execution Feedback for Debugging Visual Programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual programs are executable code generated by large language models to address visual reasoning problems. They decompose complex questions into multiple reasoning steps and invoke specialized models for each step to solve the problems. However, these programs are prone to logic errors, with our preliminary evaluation showing that 58% of the total errors are caused by program logic errors. Debugging complex visual programs remains a major bottleneck for visual reasoning. To address this, we introduce VDebugger, a novel critic-refiner framework trained to localize and debug visual programs by tracking execution step by step. VDebugger identifies and corrects program errors leveraging detailed execution feedback, improving interpretability and accuracy. The training data is generated through an automated pipeline that injects errors into correct visual programs using a novel mask-best decoding technique. Evaluations on six datasets demonstrate VDebugger's effectiveness, showing performance improvements of up to 3.2% in downstream task accuracy. Further studies show VDebugger's ability to generalize to unseen tasks, bringing a notable improvement of 2.3% on the unseen COVR task. Code, data and models are made publicly available at https://github.com/shirley-wu/vdebugger/</description>

      <title>Losing Visual Needles in Image Haystacks: Vision Language Models are Easily Distracted in Short and Long Contexts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present LoCoVQA, a dynamic benchmark generator for evaluating long-context extractive reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). LoCoVQA augments test examples for mathematical reasoning, VQA, and character recognition tasks with increasingly long visual contexts composed of both in-distribution and out-of-distribution distractor images.
  Across these tasks, a diverse set of VLMs rapidly lose performance as the visual context length grows, often exhibiting a striking logarithmic decay trend. This test assesses how well VLMs can ignore irrelevant information when answering queries -- a task that is quite easy for language models (LMs) in the text domain -- demonstrating that current state-of-the-art VLMs lack this essential capability for many long-context applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs with visual inputs, i.e., Vision Language Models (VLMs), have the capacity to process state information as visual-textual prompts and respond with policy decisions in text. We propose LLaRA: Large Language and Robotics Assistant, a framework that formulates robot action policy as conversations and provides improved action outputs when trained with auxiliary data that complements policy learning. We first introduce an automated pipeline to generate conversation-style instruction tuning data from existing behavior cloning data. Then we enrich the dataset in a self-supervised fashion by formulating six auxiliary tasks. A VLM finetuned with the resulting collection of datasets can generate meaningful robot action policy decisions. Our experiments across multiple simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed LLaRA framework. The code, datasets, and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/LostXine/LLaRA.</description>

      <title>Not (yet) the whole story: Evaluating Visual Storytelling Requires More than Measuring Coherence, Grounding, and Repetition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual storytelling consists in generating a natural language story given a temporally ordered sequence of images. This task is not only challenging for models, but also very difficult to evaluate with automatic metrics since there is no consensus about what makes a story 'good'. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that measures story quality in terms of human likeness regarding three key aspects highlighted in previous work: visual grounding, coherence, and repetitiveness. We then use this method to evaluate the stories generated by several models, showing that the foundation model LLaVA obtains the best result, but only slightly so compared to TAPM, a 50-times smaller visual storytelling model. Upgrading the visual and language components of TAPM results in a model that yields competitive performance with a relatively low number of parameters. Finally, we carry out a human evaluation study, whose results suggest that a 'good' story may require more than a human-like level of visual grounding, coherence, and repetition.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an approach to bias deep generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models, towards generating data with either enhanced fidelity or increased diversity. Our approach involves manipulating the distribution of training and generated data through a novel metric for individual samples, named pseudo density, which is based on the nearest-neighbor information from real samples. Our approach offers three distinct techniques to adjust the fidelity and diversity of deep generative models: 1) Per-sample perturbation, enabling precise adjustments for individual samples towards either more common or more unique characteristics; 2) Importance sampling during model inference to enhance either fidelity or diversity in the generated data; 3) Fine-tuning with importance sampling, which guides the generative model to learn an adjusted distribution, thus controlling fidelity and diversity. Furthermore, our fine-tuning method demonstrates the ability to improve the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for pre-trained generative models with minimal iterations.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Truth: Do VLMs really Understand Charts? A Deep Dive into Consistency and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chart question answering (CQA) is a crucial area of Visual Language Understanding. However, the robustness and consistency of current Visual Language Models (VLMs) in this field remain under-explored. This paper evaluates state-of-the-art VLMs on comprehensive datasets, developed specifically for this study, encompassing diverse question categories and chart formats. We investigate two key aspects: 1) the models' ability to handle varying levels of chart and question complexity, and 2) their robustness across different visual representations of the same underlying data. Our analysis reveals significant performance variations based on question and chart types, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses of current models. Additionally, we identify areas for improvement and propose future research directions to build more robust and reliable CQA systems. This study sheds light on the limitations of current models and paves the way for future advancements in the field.</description>

      <title>WaveMixSR-V2: Enhancing Super-resolution with Higher Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in single image super-resolution have been predominantly driven by token mixers and transformer architectures. WaveMixSR utilized the WaveMix architecture, employing a two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform for spatial token mixing, achieving superior performance in super-resolution tasks with remarkable resource efficiency. In this work, we present an enhanced version of the WaveMixSR architecture by (1) replacing the traditional transpose convolution layer with a pixel shuffle operation and (2) implementing a multistage design for higher resolution tasks ($4\times$). Our experiments demonstrate that our enhanced model -- WaveMixSR-V2 -- outperforms other architectures in multiple super-resolution tasks, achieving state-of-the-art for the BSD100 dataset, while also consuming fewer resources, exhibits higher parameter efficiency, lower latency and higher throughput. Our code is available at https://github.com/pranavphoenix/WaveMixSR.</description>

      <title>Data Diet: Can Trimming PET/CT Datasets Enhance Lesion Segmentation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we describe our approach to compete in the autoPET3 datacentric track. While conventional wisdom suggests that larger datasets lead to better model performance, recent studies indicate that excluding certain training samples can enhance model accuracy. We find that in the autoPETIII dataset, a model that is trained on the entire dataset exhibits undesirable characteristics by producing a large number of false positives particularly for PSMA-PETs. We counteract this by removing the easiest samples from the training dataset as measured by the model loss before retraining from scratch. Using the proposed approach we manage to drive down the false negative volume and improve upon the baseline model in both false negative volume and dice score on the preliminary test set. Code and pre-trained models are available at github.com/alexanderjaus/autopet3_datadiet.</description>

      <title>OmniBench: Towards The Future of Universal Omni-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have aimed to integrate and interpret data across diverse modalities. However, the capacity of these models to concurrently process and reason about multiple modalities remains inadequately explored, partly due to the lack of comprehensive modality-wise benchmarks. We introduce OmniBench, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate models' ability to recognize, interpret, and reason across visual, acoustic, and textual inputs simultaneously. We define models capable of such tri-modal processing as omni-language models (OLMs). OmniBench is distinguished by high-quality human annotations, ensuring that accurate responses require integrated understanding and reasoning across all three modalities. Our main findings reveal that: i) most OLMs exhibit critical limitations in instruction-following and reasoning capabilities within tri-modal contexts; and ii) most baselines models perform poorly (below 50\% accuracy) even when provided with alternative textual representations of images or/and audio. These results suggest that the ability to construct a consistent context from text, image, and audio is often overlooked in existing MLLM training paradigms. To address this gap, we curate an instruction tuning dataset of 84.5K training samples, OmniInstruct, for training OLMs to adapt to multimodal contexts. We advocate for future research to focus on developing more robust tri-modal integration techniques and training strategies to enhance OLM performance across diverse modalities. The codes and live leaderboard could be found at https://m-a-p.ai/OmniBench.</description>

      <title>Lessons Learned from a Unifying Empirical Study of Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) in Visual Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) has attracted significant attention lately, due to the increasing size of pre-trained models and the need to fine-tune (FT) them for superior downstream performance. This community-wide enthusiasm has sparked a plethora of approaches. Nevertheless, a systematic study to understand their performance and suitable application scenarios is lacking, leaving questions like when to apply PETL and which approach to use largely unanswered. In this paper, we conduct a unifying empirical study of representative PETL methods in the context of Vision Transformers. We systematically tune their hyper-parameters to fairly compare their accuracy on downstream tasks. Our study not only offers a valuable user guide but also unveils several new insights. First, if tuned carefully, different PETL methods can obtain similar accuracy in the low-shot benchmark VTAB-1K. This includes simple methods like FT the bias terms that were reported inferior. Second, though with similar accuracy, we find that PETL methods make different mistakes and high-confidence predictions, likely due to their different inductive biases. Such an inconsistency (or complementariness) opens up the opportunity for ensemble methods, and we make preliminary attempts at this. Third, going beyond the commonly used low-shot tasks, we find that PETL is also useful in many-shot regimes -- it achieves comparable and sometimes better accuracy than full FT, using much fewer learnable parameters. Last but not least, we investigate PETL's ability to preserve a pre-trained model's robustness to distribution shifts (e.g., a CLIP backbone). Perhaps not surprisingly, PETL methods outperform full FT alone. However, with weight-space ensembles, the fully fine-tuned model can better balance target (i.e., downstream) distribution and distribution shift performance, suggesting a future research direction for PETL.</description>

      <title>SDCL: Students Discrepancy-Informed Correction Learning for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) has been demonstrated the potential to mitigate the issue of limited medical labeled data. However, confirmation and cognitive biases may affect the prevalent teacher-student based SSMIS methods due to erroneous pseudo-labels. To tackle this challenge, we improve the mean teacher approach and propose the Students Discrepancy-Informed Correction Learning (SDCL) framework that includes two students and one non-trainable teacher, which utilizes the segmentation difference between the two students to guide the self-correcting learning. The essence of SDCL is to identify the areas of segmentation discrepancy as the potential bias areas, and then encourage the model to review the correct cognition and rectify their own biases in these areas. To facilitate the bias correction learning with continuous review and rectification, two correction loss functions are employed to minimize the correct segmentation voxel distance and maximize the erroneous segmentation voxel entropy. We conducted experiments on three public medical image datasets: two 3D datasets (CT and MRI) and one 2D dataset (MRI). The results show that our SDCL surpasses the current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) methods by 2.57\%, 3.04\%, and 2.34\% in the Dice score on the Pancreas, LA, and ACDC datasets, respectively. In addition, the accuracy of our method is very close to the fully supervised method on the ACDC dataset, and even exceeds the fully supervised method on the Pancreas and LA dataset.

      <title>M2Distill: Multi-Modal Distillation for Lifelong Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lifelong imitation learning for manipulation tasks poses significant challenges due to distribution shifts that occur in incremental learning steps. Existing methods often focus on unsupervised skill discovery to construct an ever-growing skill library or distillation from multiple policies, which can lead to scalability issues as diverse manipulation tasks are continually introduced and may fail to ensure a consistent latent space throughout the learning process, leading to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned skills. In this paper, we introduce M2Distill, a multi-modal distillation-based method for lifelong imitation learning focusing on preserving consistent latent space across vision, language, and action distributions throughout the learning process. By regulating the shifts in latent representations across different modalities from previous to current steps, and reducing discrepancies in Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) policies between consecutive learning steps, we ensure that the learned policy retains its ability to perform previously learned tasks while seamlessly integrating new skills. Extensive evaluations on the LIBERO lifelong imitation learning benchmark suites, including LIBERO-OBJECT, LIBERO-GOAL, and LIBERO-SPATIAL, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics.</description>

      <title>Deep Model Interpretation with Limited Data : A Coreset-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model Interpretation aims at the extraction of insights from the internals of a trained model. A common approach to address this task is the characterization of relevant features internally encoded in the model that are critical for its proper operation. Despite recent progress of these methods, they come with the weakness of being computationally expensive due to the dense evaluation of datasets that they require. As a consequence, research on the design of these methods have focused on smaller data subsets which may led to reduced insights. To address these computational costs, we propose a coreset-based interpretation framework that utilizes coreset selection methods to sample a representative subset of the large dataset for the interpretation task. Towards this goal, we propose a similarity-based evaluation protocol to assess the robustness of model interpretation methods towards the amount data they take as input. Experiments considering several interpretation methods, DNN models, and coreset selection methods show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>VideoCLIP-XL: Advancing Long Description Understanding for Video CLIP Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has been widely studied and applied in numerous applications. However, the emphasis on brief summary texts during pre-training prevents CLIP from understanding long descriptions. This issue is particularly acute regarding videos given that videos often contain abundant detailed contents. In this paper, we propose the VideoCLIP-XL (eXtra Length) model, which aims to unleash the long-description understanding capability of video CLIP models. Firstly, we establish an automatic data collection system and gather a large-scale VILD pre-training dataset with VIdeo and Long-Description pairs. Then, we propose Text-similarity-guided Primary Component Matching (TPCM) to better learn the distribution of feature space while expanding the long description capability. We also introduce two new tasks namely Detail-aware Description Ranking (DDR) and Hallucination-aware Description Ranking (HDR) for further understanding improvement. Finally, we construct a Long Video Description Ranking (LVDR) benchmark for evaluating the long-description capability more comprehensively. Extensive experimental results on widely-used text-video retrieval benchmarks with both short and long descriptions and our LVDR benchmark can fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>CSIM: A Copula-based similarity index sensitive to local changes for Image quality assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image similarity metrics play an important role in computer vision applications, as they are used in image processing, computer vision and machine learning. Furthermore, those metrics enable tasks such as image retrieval, object recognition and quality assessment, essential in fields like healthcare, astronomy and surveillance. Existing metrics, such as PSNR, MSE, SSIM, ISSM and FSIM, often face limitations in terms of either speed, complexity or sensitivity to small changes in images. To address these challenges, a novel image similarity metric, namely CSIM, that combines real-time while being sensitive to subtle image variations is investigated in this paper. The novel metric uses Gaussian Copula from probability theory to transform an image into vectors of pixel distribution associated to local image patches. These vectors contain, in addition to intensities and pixel positions, information on the dependencies between pixel values, capturing the structural relationships within the image. By leveraging the properties of Copulas, CSIM effectively models the joint distribution of pixel intensities, enabling a more nuanced comparison of image patches making it more sensitive to local changes compared to other metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that CSIM outperforms existing similarity metrics in various image distortion scenarios, including noise, compression artifacts and blur. The metric's ability to detect subtle differences makes it suitable for applications requiring high precision, such as medical imaging, where the detection of minor anomalies can be of a high importance.

      <title>From Pixels to Tokens: Byte-Pair Encoding on Quantized Visual Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have made significant strides in integrating visual and textual information, yet they often struggle with effectively aligning these modalities. We introduce a novel image tokenizer that bridges this gap by applying the principle of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) to visual data. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on separate visual encoders, our method directly incorporates structural prior information into image tokens, mirroring the successful tokenization strategies used in text-only Large Language Models. This innovative approach enables Transformer models to more effectively learn and reason across modalities. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BPE Image Tokenizer significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal understanding capabilities, even with limited training data. Our method not only improves performance across various benchmarks but also shows promising scalability, potentially paving the way for more efficient and capable multimodal foundation models.</description>
