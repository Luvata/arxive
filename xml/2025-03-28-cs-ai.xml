      <title>LEGO-Puzzles: How Good Are MLLMs at Multi-Step Spatial Reasoning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-step spatial reasoning entails understanding and reasoning about spatial relationships across multiple sequential steps, which is crucial for tackling complex real-world applications, such as robotic manipulation, autonomous navigation, and automated assembly. To assess how well current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have acquired this fundamental capability, we introduce \textbf{LEGO-Puzzles}, a scalable benchmark designed to evaluate both \textbf{spatial understanding} and \textbf{sequential reasoning} in MLLMs through LEGO-based tasks. LEGO-Puzzles consists of 1,100 carefully curated visual question-answering (VQA) samples spanning 11 distinct tasks, ranging from basic spatial understanding to complex multi-step reasoning. Based on LEGO-Puzzles, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs and uncover significant limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities: even the most powerful MLLMs can answer only about half of the test cases, whereas human participants achieve over 90\% accuracy. In addition to VQA tasks, we evaluate MLLMs' abilities to generate LEGO images following assembly illustrations. Our experiments show that only Gemini-2.0-Flash and GPT-4o exhibit a limited ability to follow these instructions, while other MLLMs either replicate the input image or generate completely irrelevant outputs. Overall, LEGO-Puzzles exposes critical deficiencies in existing MLLMs' spatial understanding and sequential reasoning capabilities, and underscores the need for further advancements in multimodal spatial reasoning.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning for Quadratic Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PLUME search, a data-driven framework that enhances search efficiency in combinatorial optimization through unsupervised learning. Unlike supervised or reinforcement learning, PLUME search learns directly from problem instances using a permutation-based loss with a non-autoregressive approach. We evaluate its performance on the quadratic assignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard problem that encompasses various combinatorial optimization problems. Experimental results demonstrate that PLUME search consistently improves solution quality. Furthermore, we study the generalization behavior and show that the learned model generalizes across different densities and sizes.</description>

      <title>OmniNova:A General Multimodal Agent Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with specialized tools presents new opportunities for intelligent automation systems. However, orchestrating multiple LLM-driven agents to tackle complex tasks remains challenging due to coordination difficulties, inefficient resource utilization, and inconsistent information flow. We present OmniNova, a modular multi-agent automation framework that combines language models with specialized tools such as web search, crawling, and code execution capabilities. OmniNova introduces three key innovations: (1) a hierarchical multi-agent architecture with distinct coordinator, planner, supervisor, and specialist agents; (2) a dynamic task routing mechanism that optimizes agent deployment based on task complexity; and (3) a multi-layered LLM integration system that allocates appropriate models to different cognitive requirements. Our evaluations across 50 complex tasks in research, data analysis, and web interaction domains demonstrate that OmniNova outperforms existing frameworks in task completion rate (87\% vs. baseline 62\%), efficiency (41\% reduced token usage), and result quality (human evaluation score of 4.2/5 vs. baseline 3.1/5). We contribute both a theoretical framework for multi-agent system design and an open-source implementation that advances the state-of-the-art in LLM-based automation systems.</description>

      <title>Direct Post-Training Preference Alignment for Multi-Agent Motion Generation Models Using Implicit Feedback from Pre-training Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs have revolutionized motion generation models in embodied applications. While LLM-type auto-regressive motion generation models benefit from training scalability, there remains a discrepancy between their token prediction objectives and human preferences. As a result, models pre-trained solely with token-prediction objectives often generate behaviors that deviate from what humans would prefer, making post-training preference alignment crucial for producing human-preferred motions. Unfortunately, post-training alignment requires extensive preference rankings of motions generated by the pre-trained model, which are costly to annotate, especially in multi-agent settings. Recently, there has been growing interest in leveraging pre-training demonstrations to scalably generate preference data for post-training alignment. However, these methods often adopt an adversarial assumption, treating all pre-trained model-generated samples as unpreferred examples. This adversarial approach overlooks the valuable signal provided by preference rankings among the model's own generations, ultimately reducing alignment effectiveness and potentially leading to misaligned behaviors. In this work, instead of treating all generated samples as equally bad, we leverage implicit preferences encoded in pre-training demonstrations to construct preference rankings among the pre-trained model's generations, offering more nuanced preference alignment guidance with zero human cost. We apply our approach to large-scale traffic simulation and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the realism of pre-trained model's generated behaviors, making a lightweight 1M motion generation model comparable to SOTA large imitation-based models by relying solely on implicit feedback from pre-training demonstrations, without additional post-training human preference annotations or high computational costs.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing world models for bilevel planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex environments, such as video games. However, they still fall short of achieving human-like sample efficiency and adaptability when learning new domains. Theory-based reinforcement learning (TBRL) is an algorithmic framework specifically designed to address this gap. Modeled on cognitive theories, TBRL leverages structured, causal world models - "theories" - as forward simulators for use in planning, generalization and exploration. Although current TBRL systems provide compelling explanations of how humans learn to play video games, they face several technical limitations: their theory languages are restrictive, and their planning algorithms are not scalable. To address these challenges, we introduce TheoryCoder, an instantiation of TBRL that exploits hierarchical representations of theories and efficient program synthesis methods for more powerful learning and planning. TheoryCoder equips agents with general-purpose abstractions (e.g., "move to"), which are then grounded in a particular environment by learning a low-level transition model (a Python program synthesized from observations by a large language model). A bilevel planning algorithm can exploit this hierarchical structure to solve large domains. We demonstrate that this approach can be successfully applied to diverse and challenging grid-world games, where approaches based on directly synthesizing a policy perform poorly. Ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of using hierarchical abstractions.</description>

      <title>Perspective-Shifted Neuro-Symbolic World Models: A Framework for Socially-Aware Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating in environments alongside humans requires agents to reason under uncertainty and account for the beliefs and intentions of those around them. Under a sequential decision-making framework, egocentric navigation can naturally be represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, social navigation additionally requires reasoning about the hidden beliefs of others, inherently leading to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where agents lack direct access to others' mental states. Inspired by Theory of Mind and Epistemic Planning, we propose (1) a neuro-symbolic model-based reinforcement learning architecture for social navigation, addressing the challenge of belief tracking in partially observable environments; and (2) a perspective-shift operator for belief estimation, leveraging recent work on Influence-based Abstractions (IBA) in structured multi-agent settings.</description>

      <title>Procedural Knowledge Ontology (PKO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Processes, workflows and guidelines are core to ensure the correct functioning of industrial companies: for the successful operations of factory lines, machinery or services, often industry operators rely on their past experience and know-how. The effect is that this Procedural Knowledge (PK) remains tacit and, as such, difficult to exploit efficiently and effectively. This paper presents PKO, the Procedural Knowledge Ontology, which enables the explicit modeling of procedures and their executions, by reusing and extending existing ontologies. PKO is built on requirements collected from three heterogeneous industrial use cases and can be exploited by any AI and data-driven tools that rely on a shared and interoperable representation to support the governance of PK throughout its life cycle. We describe its structure and design methodology, and outline its relevance, quality, and impact by discussing applications leveraging PKO for PK elicitation and exploitation.</description>

      <title>Inductive Link Prediction on N-ary Relational Facts via Semantic Hypergraph Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: N-ary relational facts represent semantic correlations among more than two entities. While recent studies have developed link prediction (LP) methods to infer missing relations for knowledge graphs (KGs) containing n-ary relational facts, they are generally limited to transductive settings. Fully inductive settings, where predictions are made on previously unseen entities, remain a significant challenge. As existing methods are mainly entity embedding-based, they struggle to capture entity-independent logical rules. To fill in this gap, we propose an n-ary subgraph reasoning framework for fully inductive link prediction (ILP) on n-ary relational facts. This framework reasons over local subgraphs and has a strong inductive inference ability to capture n-ary patterns. Specifically, we introduce a novel graph structure, the n-ary semantic hypergraph, to facilitate subgraph extraction. Moreover, we develop a subgraph aggregating network, NS-HART, to effectively mine complex semantic correlations within subgraphs. Theoretically, we provide a thorough analysis from the score function optimization perspective to shed light on NS-HART's effectiveness for n-ary ILP tasks. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on a series of inductive benchmarks, including transfer reasoning (with and without entity features) and pairwise subgraph reasoning. The results highlight the superiority of the n-ary subgraph reasoning framework and the exceptional inductive ability of NS-HART. The source code of this paper has been made publicly available at https://github.com/yin-gz/Nary-Inductive-SubGraph.</description>

      <title>Graph-Enhanced Model-Free Reinforcement Learning Agents for Efficient Power Grid Topological Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of power grid management, driven by the emergence of prosumers and the demand for cleaner energy solutions, has needed innovative approaches to ensure stability and efficiency. This paper presents a novel approach within the model-free framework of reinforcement learning, aimed at optimizing power network operations without prior expert knowledge. We introduce a masked topological action space, enabling agents to explore diverse strategies for cost reduction while maintaining reliable service using the state logic as a guide for choosing proper actions. Through extensive experimentation across 20 different scenarios in a simulated 5-substation environment, we demonstrate that our approach achieves a consistent reduction in power losses, while ensuring grid stability against potential blackouts. The results underscore the effectiveness of combining dynamic observation formalization with opponent-based training, showing a viable way for autonomous management solutions in modern energy systems or even for building a foundational model for this field.</description>

      <title>Role of AI Innovation, Clean Energy and Digital Economy towards Net Zero Emission in the United States: An ARDL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current paper investigates the influences of AI innovation, GDP growth, renewable energy utilization, the digital economy, and industrialization on CO2 emissions in the USA from 1990 to 2022, incorporating the ARDL methodology. The outcomes observe that AI innovation, renewable energy usage, and the digital economy reduce CO2 emissions, while GDP expansion and industrialization intensify ecosystem damage. Unit root tests (ADF, PP, and DF-GLS) reveal heterogeneous integration levels amongst components, ensuring robustness in the ARDL analysis. Complementary methods (FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR) validate the results, enhancing their reliability. Pairwise Granger causality assessments identify strong unidirectional connections within CO2 emissions and AI innovation, as well as the digital economy, underscoring their significant roles in ecological sustainability. This research highlights the requirement for strategic actions to nurture equitable growth, including advancements in AI technology, green energy adoption, and environmentally conscious industrial development, to improve environmental quality in the United States.</description>

      <title>Reverse Prompt: Cracking the Recipe Inside Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image generation has become increasingly popular, but achieving the desired images often requires extensive prompt engineering. In this paper, we explore how to decode textual prompts from reference images, a process we refer to as image reverse prompt engineering. This technique enables us to gain insights from reference images, understand the creative processes of great artists, and generate impressive new images. To address this challenge, we propose a method known as automatic reverse prompt optimization (ARPO). Specifically, our method refines an initial prompt into a high-quality prompt through an iteratively imitative gradient prompt optimization process: 1) generating a recreated image from the current prompt to instantiate its guidance capability; 2) producing textual gradients, which are candidate prompts intended to reduce the difference between the recreated image and the reference image; 3) updating the current prompt with textual gradients using a greedy search method to maximize the CLIP similarity between prompt and reference image. We compare ARPO with several baseline methods, including handcrafted techniques, gradient-based prompt tuning methods, image captioning, and data-driven selection method. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our ARPO converges quickly to generate high-quality reverse prompts. More importantly, we can easily create novel images with diverse styles and content by directly editing these reverse prompts. Code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>FuXi-RTM: A Physics-Guided Prediction Framework with Radiative Transfer Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Similar to conventional video generation, current deep learning-based weather prediction frameworks often lack explicit physical constraints, leading to unphysical outputs that limit their reliability for operational forecasting. Among various physical processes requiring proper representation, radiation plays a fundamental role as it drives Earth's weather and climate systems. However, accurate simulation of radiative transfer processes remains challenging for traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models due to their inherent complexity and high computational costs. Here, we propose FuXi-RTM, a hybrid physics-guided deep learning framework designed to enhance weather forecast accuracy while enforcing physical consistency. FuXi-RTM integrates a primary forecasting model (FuXi) with a fixed deep learning-based radiative transfer model (DLRTM) surrogate that efficiently replaces conventional radiation parameterization schemes. This represents the first deep learning-based weather forecasting framework to explicitly incorporate physical process modeling. Evaluated over a comprehensive 5-year dataset, FuXi-RTM outperforms its unconstrained counterpart in 88.51% of 3320 variable and lead time combinations, with improvements in radiative flux predictions. By incorporating additional physical processes, FuXi-RTM paves the way for next-generation weather forecasting systems that are both accurate and physically consistent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of realizing artificial general intelligence (AGI), the importance of embodied artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly apparent. Following this trend, research integrating robots with AGI has become prominent. As various kinds of embodiments have been designed, adaptability to diverse embodiments will become important to AGI. We introduce a new challenge, termed "Body Discovery of Embodied AI", focusing on tasks of recognizing embodiments and summarizing neural signal functionality. The challenge encompasses the precise definition of an AI body and the intricate task of identifying embodiments in dynamic environments, where conventional approaches often prove inadequate. To address these challenges, we apply causal inference method and evaluate it by developing a simulator tailored for testing algorithms with virtual environments. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our algorithms through empirical testing, demonstrating their robust performance in various scenarios based on virtual environments.</description>

      <title>A Spatiotemporal Radar-Based Precipitation Model for Water Level Prediction and Flood Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Study Region: Goslar and G\"ottingen, Lower Saxony, Germany. Study Focus: In July 2017, the cities of Goslar and G\"ottingen experienced severe flood events characterized by short warning time of only 20 minutes, resulting in extensive regional flooding and significant damage. This highlights the critical need for a more reliable and timely flood forecasting system. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the impact of radar-based precipitation data on forecasting river water levels in Goslar. Additionally, the study examines how precipitation influences water level forecasts in G\"ottingen. The analysis integrates radar-derived spatiotemporal precipitation patterns with hydrological sensor data obtained from ground stations to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in improving flood prediction capabilities. New Hydrological Insights for the Region: A key innovation in this paper is the use of residual-based modeling to address the non-linearity between precipitation images and water levels, leading to a Spatiotemporal Radar-based Precipitation Model with residuals (STRPMr). Unlike traditional hydrological models, our approach does not rely on upstream data, making it independent of additional hydrological inputs. This independence enhances its adaptability and allows for broader applicability in other regions with RADOLAN precipitation. The deep learning architecture integrates (2+1)D convolutional neural networks for spatial and temporal feature extraction with LSTM for timeseries forecasting. The results demonstrate the potential of the STRPMr for capturing extreme events and more accurate flood forecasting.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Breast Cancer Detection in Mammograms: A Comprehensive Study of Transfer Learning, Resolution Reduction, and Multi-View Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores open questions in the application of machine learning for breast cancer detection in mammograms. Current approaches often employ a two-stage transfer learning process: first, adapting a backbone model trained on natural images to develop a patch classifier, which is then used to create a single-view whole-image classifier. Additionally, many studies leverage both mammographic views to enhance model performance. In this work, we systematically investigate five key questions: (1) Is the intermediate patch classifier essential for optimal performance? (2) Do backbone models that excel in natural image classification consistently outperform others on mammograms? (3) When reducing mammogram resolution for GPU processing, does the learn-to-resize technique outperform conventional methods? (4) Does incorporating both mammographic views in a two-view classifier significantly improve detection accuracy? (5) How do these findings vary when analyzing low-quality versus high-quality mammograms? By addressing these questions, we developed models that outperform previous results for both single-view and two-view classifiers. Our findings provide insights into model architecture and transfer learning strategies contributing to more accurate and efficient mammogram analysis.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Depth: A Depth Adapter with Positional Depth Encoding for Generalized Image Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized metric depth understanding is critical for precise vision-guided robotics, which current state-of-the-art (SOTA) vision-encoders do not support. To address this, we propose Vanishing Depth, a self-supervised training approach that extends pretrained RGB encoders to incorporate and align metric depth into their feature embeddings. Based on our novel positional depth encoding, we enable stable depth density and depth distribution invariant feature extraction. We achieve performance improvements and SOTA results across a spectrum of relevant RGBD downstream tasks - without the necessity of finetuning the encoder. Most notably, we achieve 56.05 mIoU on SUN-RGBD segmentation, 88.3 RMSE on Void's depth completion, and 83.8 Top 1 accuracy on NYUv2 scene classification. In 6D-object pose estimation, we outperform our predecessors of DinoV2, EVA-02, and Omnivore and achieve SOTA results for non-finetuned encoders in several related RGBD downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Reasoning Through Visual Human Preferences with VLMs and Soft Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can Visual Language Models (VLMs) effectively capture human visual preferences? This work addresses this question by training VLMs to think about preferences at test time, employing reinforcement learning methods inspired by DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI O1. Using datasets such as ImageReward and Human Preference Score v2 (HPSv2), our models achieve accuracies of 64.9% on the ImageReward test set (trained on ImageReward official split) and 65.4% on HPSv2 (trained on approximately 25% of its data). These results match traditional encoder-based models while providing transparent reasoning and enhanced generalization. This approach allows to use not only rich VLM world knowledge, but also its potential to think, yielding interpretable outcomes that help decision-making processes. By demonstrating that human visual preferences reasonable by current VLMs, we introduce efficient soft-reward strategies for image ranking, outperforming simplistic selection or scoring methods. This reasoning capability enables VLMs to rank arbitrary images-regardless of aspect ratio or complexity-thereby potentially amplifying the effectiveness of visual Preference Optimization. By reducing the need for extensive markup while improving reward generalization and explainability, our findings can be a strong mile-stone that will enhance text-to-vision models even further.</description>

      <title>LogQuant: Log-Distributed 2-Bit Quantization of KV Cache with Superior Accuracy Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LogQuant, a groundbreaking 2-bit quantization technique for KV Cache in large language model (LLM) inference, delivering substantial memory savings while preserving superior performance. Previous methods either assume that later tokens are more important or attempt to predict important tokens based on earlier attention patterns. Both approaches, however, can result in performance bottlenecks or frequent mispredictions.
  LogQuant takes a different approach. By applying a log-based filtering mechanism, it selectively compresses the KV Cache across the entire context, achieving better performance with the same or even reduced memory footprint compared to existing methods. In benchmark tests, it enhances throughput by 25% and boosts batch size by 60% without increasing memory consumption. For challenging tasks such as Math and Code Completion, LogQuant improves accuracy by 40% to 200% at the same compression ratio, outperforming comparable techniques.LogQuant integrates effortlessly with popular inference frameworks like Python's transformers library. Implementation can be available in https://github.com/Concyclics/LogQuantKV.</description>

      <title>ACVUBench: Audio-Centric Video Understanding Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio often serves as an auxiliary modality in video understanding tasks of audio-visual large language models (LLMs), merely assisting in the comprehension of visual information. However, a thorough understanding of videos significantly depends on auditory information, as audio offers critical context, emotional cues, and semantic meaning that visual data alone often lacks. This paper proposes an audio-centric video understanding benchmark (ACVUBench) to evaluate the video comprehension capabilities of multimodal LLMs with a particular focus on auditory information. Specifically, ACVUBench incorporates 2,662 videos spanning 18 different domains with rich auditory information, together with over 13k high-quality human annotated or validated question-answer pairs. Moreover, ACVUBench introduces a suite of carefully designed audio-centric tasks, holistically testing the understanding of both audio content and audio-visual interactions in videos. A thorough evaluation across a diverse range of open-source and proprietary multimodal LLMs is performed, followed by the analyses of deficiencies in audio-visual LLMs. Demos are available at https://github.com/lark-png/ACVUBench.</description>

      <title>ExCoT: Optimizing Reasoning for Text-to-SQL with Execution Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL demands precise reasoning to convert natural language questions into structured queries. While large language models (LLMs) excel in many reasoning tasks, their ability to leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for text-to-SQL remains underexplored. We identify critical limitations: zero-shot CoT offers minimal gains, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) applied without CoT yields marginal improvements. We propose ExCoT, a novel framework that iteratively optimizes open-source LLMs by combining CoT reasoning with off-policy and on-policy DPO, relying solely on execution accuracy as feedback. This approach eliminates the need for reward models or human-annotated preferences.
  Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains: ExCoT improves execution accuracy on BIRD dev set from 57.37% to 68.51% and on Spider test set from 78.81% to 86.59% for LLaMA-3 70B, with Qwen-2.5-Coder demonstrating similar improvements. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the single-model setting on both BIRD and Spider datasets, notably achieving 68.53% on the BIRD test set.</description>

      <title>Experience Replay Addresses Loss of Plasticity in Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loss of plasticity is one of the main challenges in continual learning with deep neural networks, where neural networks trained via backpropagation gradually lose their ability to adapt to new tasks and perform significantly worse than their freshly initialized counterparts. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new hypothesis that experience replay addresses the loss of plasticity in continual learning. Here, experience replay is a form of memory. We provide supporting evidence for this hypothesis. In particular, we demonstrate in multiple different tasks, including regression, classification, and policy evaluation, that by simply adding an experience replay and processing the data in the experience replay with Transformers, the loss of plasticity disappears. Notably, we do not alter any standard components of deep learning. For example, we do not change backpropagation. We do not modify the activation functions. And we do not use any regularization. We conjecture that experience replay and Transformers can address the loss of plasticity because of the in-context learning phenomenon.</description>

      <title>BugCraft: End-to-End Crash Bug Reproduction Using LLM Agents in Minecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reproducing game bugs, in our case crash bugs in continuously evolving games like Minecraft, is a notoriously manual, time-consuming, and challenging process to automate. Despite the success of LLM-driven bug reproduction in other software domains, games, with their complex interactive environments, remain largely unaddressed. This paper introduces BugCraft, a novel end-to-end framework designed to automate the reproduction of crash bugs in Minecraft directly from user-submitted bug reports, addressing the critical gap in automated game bug reproduction. BugCraft employs a two-stage approach: first, a Step Synthesizer leverages LLMs and Minecraft Wiki knowledge to transform bug reports into high-quality, structured steps to reproduce (S2R). Second, an Action Model, powered by a vision-based LLM agent (GPT-4o) and a custom macro API, executes these S2R steps within Minecraft to trigger the reported crash. To facilitate evaluation, we introduce BugCraft-Bench, a curated dataset of Minecraft crash bug reports. Evaluated on BugCraft-Bench, our framework successfully reproduced 30.23% of crash bugs end-to-end. The Step Synthesizer demonstrated a 66.28% accuracy in generating correct bug reproduction plans, highlighting its effectiveness in interpreting and structuring bug report information. BugCraft demonstrates the feasibility of automated reproduction of crash bugs in complex game environments using LLMs, opening promising avenues for game testing and development. The framework and the BugCraft-Bench dataset pave the way for future research in automated game bug analysis and hold potential for generalization to other interactive game platforms. Finally, we make our code open at https://bugcraft2025.github.io/</description>

      <title>Adaptive Orchestration for Large-Scale Inference on Heterogeneous Accelerator Systems Balancing Cost, Performance, and Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surge in generative AI workloads has created a need for scalable inference systems that can flexibly harness both GPUs and specialized accelerators while containing operational costs. This paper proposes a hardware-agnostic control loop that adaptively allocates requests across heterogeneous accelerators based on real-time cost and capacity signals. The approach sustains low latency and high throughput by dynamically shifting between cost-optimized and capacity-optimized modes, ensuring the most efficient use of expensive compute resources under fluctuating availability. Evaluated using the Stable Diffusion model, the framework consistently meets latency targets, automatically redirects traffic during capacity shortfalls, and capitalizes on lower-cost accelerators when possible. These results highlight how a feedback-driven deployment strategy, spanning the entire software and hardware stack, can help organizations efficiently scale generative AI workloads while maintaining resilience in the face of limited accelerator capacity.</description>

      <title>Abstracting Geo-specific Terrains to Scale Up Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is increasingly ubiquitous in training dynamic and adaptive synthetic characters for interactive simulations on geo-specific terrains. Frameworks such as Unity's ML-Agents help to make such reinforcement learning experiments more accessible to the simulation community. Military training simulations also benefit from advances in MARL, but they have immense computational requirements due to their complex, continuous, stochastic, partially observable, non-stationary, and doctrine-based nature. Furthermore, these simulations require geo-specific terrains, further exacerbating the computational resources problem. In our research, we leverage Unity's waypoints to automatically generate multi-layered representation abstractions of the geo-specific terrains to scale up reinforcement learning while still allowing the transfer of learned policies between different representations. Our early exploratory results on a novel MARL scenario, where each side has differing objectives, indicate that waypoint-based navigation enables faster and more efficient learning while producing trajectories similar to those taken by expert human players in CSGO gaming environments. This research points out the potential of waypoint-based navigation for reducing the computational costs of developing and training MARL models for military training simulations, where geo-specific terrains and differing objectives are crucial.</description>

      <title>Can Multi-modal (reasoning) LLMs work as deepfake detectors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a critical challenge in the era of advanced generative models, particularly as synthetic media becomes more sophisticated. In this study, we explore the potential of state of the art multi-modal (reasoning) large language models (LLMs) for deepfake image detection such as (OpenAI O1/4o, Gemini thinking Flash 2, Deepseek Janus, Grok 3, llama 3.2, Qwen 2/2.5 VL, Mistral Pixtral, Claude 3.5/3.7 sonnet) . We benchmark 12 latest multi-modal LLMs against traditional deepfake detection methods across multiple datasets, including recently published real-world deepfake imagery. To enhance performance, we employ prompt tuning and conduct an in-depth analysis of the models' reasoning pathways to identify key contributing factors in their decision-making process. Our findings indicate that best multi-modal LLMs achieve competitive performance with promising generalization ability with zero shot, even surpass traditional deepfake detection pipelines in out-of-distribution datasets while the rest of the LLM families performs extremely disappointing with some worse than random guess. Furthermore, we found newer model version and reasoning capabilities does not contribute to performance in such niche tasks of deepfake detection while model size do help in some cases. This study highlights the potential of integrating multi-modal reasoning in future deepfake detection frameworks and provides insights into model interpretability for robustness in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines how AI identity influences psychological empowerment and unethical AI behavior among college students, while also exploring the moderating role of IT mindfulness. Findings show that a strong AI identity enhances psychological empowerment and academic engagement but can also lead to increased unethical AI practices. Crucially, IT mindfulness acts as an ethical safeguard, promoting sensitivity to ethical concerns and reducing misuse of AI. These insights have implications for educators, policymakers, and AI developers, emphasizing For Peer Review the need for a balanced approach that encourages digital engagement without compromising student responsibility. The study also contributes to philosophical discussions of psychological agency, suggesting that empowerment through AI can yield both positive and negative outcomes. Mindfulness emerges as essential in guiding ethical AI interactions. Overall, the research informs ongoing debates on ethics in education and AI, offering strategies to align technological advancement with ethical accountability and responsible use.</description>

      <title>Efficient Model Development through Fine-tuning Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern LLMs struggle with efficient updates, as each new pretrained model version requires repeating expensive alignment processes. This challenge also applies to domain- or language-specific models, where fine-tuning on specialized data must be redone for every new base model release. In this paper, we explore the transfer of fine-tuning updates between model versions. Specifically, we derive the diff vector from one source model version, which represents the weight changes from fine-tuning, and apply it to the base model of a different target version. Through empirical evaluations on various open-weight model versions, we show that transferring diff vectors can significantly improve the target base model, often achieving performance comparable to its fine-tuned counterpart. For example, reusing the fine-tuning updates from Llama 3.0 8B leads to an absolute accuracy improvement of 10.7% on GPQA over the base Llama 3.1 8B without additional training, surpassing Llama 3.1 8B Instruct. In a multilingual model development setting, we show that this approach can significantly increase performance on target-language tasks without retraining, achieving an absolute improvement of 4.7% and 15.5% on Global MMLU for Malagasy and Turkish, respectively, compared to Llama 3.1 8B Instruct. Our controlled experiments reveal that fine-tuning transfer is most effective when the source and target models are linearly connected in the parameter space. Additionally, we demonstrate that fine-tuning transfer offers a stronger and more computationally efficient starting point for further fine-tuning. Finally, we propose an iterative recycling-then-finetuning approach for continuous model development, which improves both efficiency and effectiveness. Our findings suggest that fine-tuning transfer is a viable strategy to reduce training costs while maintaining model performance.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Human-Object Interaction Synthesis with Multimodal Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) synthesis is important for various applications, ranging from virtual reality to robotics. However, acquiring 3D HOI data is challenging due to its complexity and high cost, limiting existing methods to the narrow diversity of object types and interaction patterns in training datasets. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot HOI synthesis framework without relying on end-to-end training on currently limited 3D HOI datasets. The core idea of our method lies in leveraging extensive HOI knowledge from pre-trained Multimodal Models. Given a text description, our system first obtains temporally consistent 2D HOI image sequences using image or video generation models, which are then uplifted to 3D HOI milestones of human and object poses. We employ pre-trained human pose estimation models to extract human poses and introduce a generalizable category-level 6-DoF estimation method to obtain the object poses from 2D HOI images. Our estimation method is adaptive to various object templates obtained from text-to-3D models or online retrieval. A physics-based tracking of the 3D HOI kinematic milestone is further applied to refine both body motions and object poses, yielding more physically plausible HOI generation results. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating open-vocabulary HOIs with physical realism and semantic diversity.</description>

      <title>Can We Make Code Green? Understanding Trade-Offs in LLMs vs. Human Code Optimizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20126</link>

Abstract: The rapid technological evolution has accelerated software development for various domains and use cases, contributing to a growing share of global carbon emissions. While recent large language models (LLMs) claim to assist developers in optimizing code for performance and energy efficiency, their efficacy in real-world scenarios remains under exploration. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of LLMs in reducing the environmental footprint of real-world projects, focusing on software written in Matlab-widely used in both academia and industry for scientific and engineering applications. We analyze energy-focused optimization on 400 scripts across 100 top GitHub repositories. We examine potential 2,176 optimizations recommended by leading LLMs, such as GPT-3, GPT-4, Llama, and Mixtral, and a senior Matlab developer, on energy consumption, memory usage, execution time consumption, and code correctness. The developer serves as a real-world baseline for comparing typical human and LLM-generated optimizations.
  Mapping these optimizations to 13 high-level themes, we found that LLMs propose a broad spectrum of improvements--beyond energy efficiency--including improving code readability and maintainability, memory management, error handling while the developer overlooked some parallel processing, error handling etc. However, our statistical tests reveal that the energy-focused optimizations unexpectedly negatively impacted memory usage, with no clear benefits regarding execution time or energy consumption. Our qualitative analysis of energy-time trade-offs revealed that some themes, such as vectorization preallocation, were among the common themes shaping these trade-offs. With LLMs becoming ubiquitous in modern software development, our study serves as a call to action: prioritizing the evaluation of common coding practices to identify the green ones.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Value of Decentralized Data: A Federated Dual Learning Approach for Model Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have revolutionized numerous fields, yet their applications often rely on costly and time-consuming data collection processes. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising alternative by enabling AI models to be trained on decentralized data where data is scattered across clients (distributed nodes). However, existing FL approaches struggle to match the performance of centralized training due to challenges such as heterogeneous data distribution and communication delays, limiting their potential for breakthroughs. We observe that many real-world use cases involve hybrid data regimes, in which a server (center node) has access to some data while a large amount of data is distributed across associated clients. To improve the utilization of decentralized data under this regime, address data heterogeneity issue, and facilitate asynchronous communication between the server and clients, we propose a dual learning approach that leverages centralized data at the server to guide the merging of model updates from clients. Our method accommodates scenarios where server data is out-of-domain relative to decentralized client data, making it applicable to a wide range of use cases. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating the faster convergence of our method compared to existing methods. Furthermore, experimental results across various scenarios show that our approach significantly outperforms existing technologies, highlighting its potential to unlock the value of large amounts of decentralized data.</description>

      <title>Look Before Leap: Look-Ahead Planning with Uncertainty in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has demonstrated superior sample efficiency compared to model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). However, the presence of inaccurate models can introduce biases during policy learning, resulting in misleading trajectories. The challenge lies in obtaining accurate models due to limited diverse training data, particularly in regions with limited visits (uncertain regions). Existing approaches passively quantify uncertainty after sample generation, failing to actively collect uncertain samples that could enhance state coverage and improve model accuracy. Moreover, MBRL often faces difficulties in making accurate multi-step predictions, thereby impacting overall performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for uncertainty-aware policy optimization with model-based exploratory planning. In the model-based planning phase, we introduce an uncertainty-aware k-step lookahead planning approach to guide action selection at each step. This process involves a trade-off analysis between model uncertainty and value function approximation error, effectively enhancing policy performance. In the policy optimization phase, we leverage an uncertainty-driven exploratory policy to actively collect diverse training samples, resulting in improved model accuracy and overall performance of the RL agent. Our approach offers flexibility and applicability to tasks with varying state/action spaces and reward structures. We validate its effectiveness through experiments on challenging robotic manipulation tasks and Atari games, surpassing state-of-the-art methods with fewer interactions, thereby leading to significant performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Offline Reinforcement Learning with Discrete Diffusion Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skills have been introduced to offline reinforcement learning (RL) as temporal abstractions to tackle complex, long-horizon tasks, promoting consistent behavior and enabling meaningful exploration. While skills in offline RL are predominantly modeled within a continuous latent space, the potential of discrete skill spaces remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose a compact discrete skill space for offline RL tasks supported by state-of-the-art transformer-based encoder and diffusion-based decoder. Coupled with a high-level policy trained via offline RL techniques, our method establishes a hierarchical RL framework where the trained diffusion decoder plays a pivotal role. Empirical evaluations show that the proposed algorithm, Discrete Diffusion Skill (DDS), is a powerful offline RL method. DDS performs competitively on Locomotion and Kitchen tasks and excels on long-horizon tasks, achieving at least a 12 percent improvement on AntMaze-v2 benchmarks compared to existing offline RL approaches. Furthermore, DDS offers improved interpretability, training stability, and online exploration compared to previous skill-based methods.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Implicit Sentiments: Enhancing Reliability and Validity in Psychological Trait Evaluation of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their increasing integration into human life. With the transition from mere tools to human-like assistants, understanding their psychological aspects-such as emotional tendencies and personalities-becomes essential for ensuring their trustworthiness. However, current psychological evaluations of LLMs, often based on human psychological assessments like the BFI, face significant limitations. The results from these approaches often lack reliability and have limited validity when predicting LLM behavior in real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel evaluation instrument specifically designed for LLMs, called Core Sentiment Inventory (CSI). CSI is a bilingual tool, covering both English and Chinese, that implicitly evaluates models' sentiment tendencies, providing an insightful psychological portrait of LLM across three dimensions: optimism, pessimism, and neutrality. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that: 1) CSI effectively captures nuanced emotional patterns, revealing significant variation in LLMs across languages and contexts; 2) Compared to current approaches, CSI significantly improves reliability, yielding more consistent results; and 3) The correlation between CSI scores and the sentiment of LLM's real-world outputs exceeds 0.85, demonstrating its strong validity in predicting LLM behavior. We make CSI public available via: https://github.com/dependentsign/CSI.</description>

      <title>Assessing SAM for Tree Crown Instance Segmentation from Drone Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential of tree planting as a natural climate solution is often undermined by inadequate monitoring of tree planting projects. Current monitoring methods involve measuring trees by hand for each species, requiring extensive cost, time, and labour. Advances in drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping and characterizing trees from aerial imagery, and large pre-trained vision models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), may be a particularly compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare SAM methods for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in high resolution drone imagery of young tree plantations. We explore the potential of SAM for this task, and find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts, but that there is potential for methods which tune SAM further. We also show that predictions can be improved by adding Digital Surface Model (DSM) information as an input.</description>

      <title>SARGes: Semantically Aligned Reliable Gesture Generation via Intent Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Co-speech gesture generation enhances human-computer interaction realism through speech-synchronized gesture synthesis. However, generating semantically meaningful gestures remains a challenging problem. We propose SARGes, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to parse speech content and generate reliable semantic gesture labels, which subsequently guide the synthesis of meaningful co-speech gestures.First, we constructed a comprehensive co-speech gesture ethogram and developed an LLM-based intent chain reasoning mechanism that systematically parses and decomposes gesture semantics into structured inference steps following ethogram criteria, effectively guiding LLMs to generate context-aware gesture labels. Subsequently, we constructed an intent chain-annotated text-to-gesture label dataset and trained a lightweight gesture label generation model, which then guides the generation of credible and semantically coherent co-speech gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that SARGes achieves highly semantically-aligned gesture labeling (50.2% accuracy) with efficient single-pass inference (0.4 seconds). The proposed method provides an interpretable intent reasoning pathway for semantic gesture synthesis.</description>

      <title>Generalized Phase Pressure Control Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Appropriate traffic state representation is crucial for learning traffic signal control policies. However, most of the current traffic state representations are heuristically designed, with insufficient theoretical support. In this paper, we (1) develop a flexible, efficient, and theoretically grounded method, namely generalized phase pressure (G2P) control, which takes only simple lane features into consideration to decide which phase to be actuated; 2) extend the pressure control theory to a general form for multi-homogeneous-lane road networks based on queueing theory; (3) design a new traffic state representation based on the generalized phase state features from G2P control; and 4) develop a reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm template named G2P-XLight, and two RL algorithms, G2P-MPLight and G2P-CoLight, by combining the generalized phase state representation with MPLight and CoLight, two well-performed RL methods for learning traffic signal control policies. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that G2P control outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) heuristic method in the transportation field and other recent human-designed heuristic methods; and that the newly proposed G2P-XLight significantly outperforms SOTA learning-based approaches. Our code is available online.</description>

      <title>Learning Adaptive Dexterous Grasping from Single Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can robots learn dexterous grasping skills efficiently and apply them adaptively based on user instructions? This work tackles two key challenges: efficient skill acquisition from limited human demonstrations and context-driven skill selection. We introduce AdaDexGrasp, a framework that learns a library of grasping skills from a single human demonstration per skill and selects the most suitable one using a vision-language model (VLM). To improve sample efficiency, we propose a trajectory following reward that guides reinforcement learning (RL) toward states close to a human demonstration while allowing flexibility in exploration. To learn beyond the single demonstration, we employ curriculum learning, progressively increasing object pose variations to enhance robustness. At deployment, a VLM retrieves the appropriate skill based on user instructions, bridging low-level learned skills with high-level intent. We evaluate AdaDexGrasp in both simulation and real-world settings, showing that our approach significantly improves RL efficiency and enables learning human-like grasp strategies across varied object configurations. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of our learned policies to a real-world PSYONIC Ability Hand, with a 90% success rate across objects, significantly outperforming the baseline.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Natural Language Processing: Exploring Transformer-Based Architectures for Text Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has witnessed a transformative leap with the advent of transformer-based architectures, which have significantly enhanced the ability of machines to understand and generate human-like text. This paper explores the advancements in transformer models, such as BERT and GPT, focusing on their superior performance in text understanding tasks compared to traditional methods like recurrent neural networks (RNNs). By analyzing statistical properties through visual representations-including probability density functions of text length distributions and feature space classifications-the study highlights the models' proficiency in handling long-range dependencies, adapting to conditional shifts, and extracting features for classification, even with overlapping classes. Drawing on recent 2024 research, including enhancements in multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning and context-aware chat interactions, the paper outlines a methodology involving data preparation, model selection, pretraining, fine-tuning, and evaluation. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like GLUE and SQuAD, with F1 scores exceeding 90%, though challenges such as high computational costs persist. This work underscores the pivotal role of transformers in modern NLP and suggests future directions, including efficiency optimization and multimodal integration, to further advance language-based AI systems.</description>

      <title>TraNCE: Transformative Non-linear Concept Explainer for CNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have succeeded remarkably in various computer vision tasks. However, they are not intrinsically explainable. While the feature-level understanding of CNNs reveals where the models looked, concept-based explainability methods provide insights into what the models saw. However, their assumption of linear reconstructability of image activations fails to capture the intricate relationships within these activations. Their Fidelity-only approach to evaluating global explanations also presents a new concern. For the first time, we address these limitations with the novel Transformative Nonlinear Concept Explainer (TraNCE) for CNNs. Unlike linear reconstruction assumptions made by existing methods, TraNCE captures the intricate relationships within the activations. This study presents three original contributions to the CNN explainability literature: (i) An automatic concept discovery mechanism based on variational autoencoders (VAEs). This transformative concept discovery process enhances the identification of meaningful concepts from image activations. (ii) A visualization module that leverages the Bessel function to create a smooth transition between prototypical image pixels, revealing not only what the CNN saw but also what the CNN avoided, thereby mitigating the challenges of concept duplication as documented in previous works. (iii) A new metric, the Faith score, integrates both Coherence and Fidelity for a comprehensive evaluation of explainer faithfulness and consistency.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Algorithmic Content Amplification on TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent algorithms increasingly shape the content we encounter and engage with online. TikTok's For You feed exemplifies extreme algorithm-driven curation, tailoring the stream of video content almost exclusively based on users' explicit and implicit interactions with the platform. Despite growing attention, the dynamics of content amplification on TikTok remain largely unquantified. How quickly, and to what extent, does TikTok's algorithm amplify content aligned with users' interests? To address these questions, we conduct a sock-puppet audit, deploying bots with different interests to engage with TikTok's "For You" feed. Our findings reveal that content aligned with the bots' interests undergoes strong amplification, with rapid reinforcement typically occurring within the first 200 videos watched. While amplification is consistently observed across all interests, its intensity varies by interest, indicating the emergence of topic-specific biases. Time series analyses and Markov models uncover distinct phases of recommendation dynamics, including persistent content reinforcement and a gradual decline in content diversity over time. Although TikTok's algorithm preserves some content diversity, we find a strong negative correlation between amplification and exploration: as the amplification of interest-aligned content increases, engagement with unseen hashtags declines. These findings contribute to discussions on socio-algorithmic feedback loops in the digital age and the trade-offs between personalization and content diversity.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Learning and Productivity for Data Analysts: A Bayesian Hidden Markov Model Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data analysts are essential in organizations, transforming raw data into insights that drive decision-making and strategy. This study explores how analysts' productivity evolves on a collaborative platform, focusing on two key learning activities: writing queries and viewing peer queries. While traditional research often assumes static models, where performance improves steadily with cumulative learning, such models fail to capture the dynamic nature of real-world learning. To address this, we propose a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that tracks how analysts transition between distinct learning states based on their participation in these activities.
  Using an industry dataset with 2,001 analysts and 79,797 queries, this study identifies three learning states: novice, intermediate, and advanced. Productivity increases as analysts advance to higher states, reflecting the cumulative benefits of learning. Writing queries benefits analysts across all states, with the largest gains observed for novices. Viewing peer queries supports novices but may hinder analysts in higher states due to cognitive overload or inefficiencies. Transitions between states are also uneven, with progression from intermediate to advanced being particularly challenging. This study advances understanding of into dynamic learning behavior of knowledge worker and offers practical implications for designing systems, optimizing training, enabling personalized learning, and fostering effective knowledge sharing.</description>

      <title>LGR: LLM-Guided Ranking of Frontiers for Object Goal Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object Goal Navigation (OGN) is a fundamental task for robots and AI, with key applications such as mobile robot image databases (MRID). In particular, mapless OGN is essential in scenarios involving unknown or dynamic environments. This study aims to enhance recent modular mapless OGN systems by leveraging the commonsense reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we address the challenge of determining the visiting order in frontier-based exploration by framing it as a frontier ranking problem. Our approach is grounded in recent findings that, while LLMs cannot determine the absolute value of a frontier, they excel at evaluating the relative value between multiple frontiers viewed within a single image using the view image as context. We dynamically manage the frontier list by adding and removing elements, using an LLM as a ranking model. The ranking results are represented as reciprocal rank vectors, which are ideal for multi-view, multi-query information fusion. We validate the effectiveness of our method through evaluations in Habitat-Sim.</description>

      <title>ESSR: An 8K@30FPS Super-Resolution Accelerator With Edge Selective Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) is challenging to implement in resource-constrained edge devices for resolutions beyond full HD due to its high computational complexity and memory bandwidth requirements. This paper introduces an 8K@30FPS SR accelerator with edge-selective dynamic input processing. Dynamic processing chooses the appropriate subnets for different patches based on simple input edge criteria, achieving a 50\% MAC reduction with only a 0.1dB PSNR decrease. The quality of reconstruction images is guaranteed and maximized its potential with \textit{resource adaptive model switching} even under resource constraints. In conjunction with hardware-specific refinements, the model size is reduced by 84\% to 51K, but with a decrease of less than 0.6dB PSNR. Additionally, to support dynamic processing with high utilization, this design incorporates a \textit{configurable group of layer mapping} that synergizes with the \textit{structure-friendly fusion block}, resulting in 77\% hardware utilization and up to 79\% reduction in feature SRAM access. The implementation, using the TSMC 28nm process, can achieve 8K@30FPS throughput at 800MHz with a gate count of 2749K, 0.2075W power consumption, and 4797Mpixels/J energy efficiency, exceeding previous work.</description>

      <title>LogicQA: Logical Anomaly Detection with Vision Language Model Generated Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) focuses on detecting samples that differ from the standard pattern, making it a vital tool in process control. Logical anomalies may appear visually normal yet violate predefined constraints on object presence, arrangement, or quantity, depending on reasoning and explainability. We introduce LogicQA, a framework that enhances AD by providing industrial operators with explanations for logical anomalies. LogicQA compiles automatically generated questions into a checklist and collects responses to identify violations of logical constraints. LogicQA is training-free, annotation-free, and operates in a few-shot setting. We achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) Logical AD performance on public benchmarks, MVTec LOCO AD, with an AUROC of 87.6 percent and an F1-max of 87.0 percent along with the explanations of anomalies. Also, our approach has shown outstanding performance on semiconductor SEM corporate data, further validating its effectiveness in industrial applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as computer-use agents, autonomously performing tasks within real desktop or web environments. While this evolution greatly expands practical use cases for humans, it also creates serious security exposures. We present SUDO (Screen-based Universal Detox2Tox Offense), a novel attack framework that systematically bypasses refusal trained safeguards in commercial computer-use agents, such as Claude Computer Use. The core mechanism, Detox2Tox, transforms harmful requests (that agents initially reject) into seemingly benign requests via detoxification, secures detailed instructions from advanced vision language models (VLMs), and then reintroduces malicious content via toxification just before execution. Unlike conventional jailbreaks, SUDO iteratively refines its attacks based on a built-in refusal feedback, making it increasingly effective against robust policy filters. In extensive tests spanning 50 real-world tasks and multiple state-of-the-art VLMs, SUDO achieves a stark attack success rate of 24% (with no refinement), and up to 41% (by its iterative refinement) in Claude Computer Use. By revealing these vulnerabilities and demonstrating the ease with which they can be exploited in real-world computing environments, this paper highlights an immediate need for robust, context-aware safeguards. WARNING: This paper includes harmful or offensive model outputs.</description>

      <title>Are We There Yet? Unraveling the State-of-the-Art Graph Network Intrusion Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are vital for ensuring enterprise security. Recently, Graph-based NIDS (GIDS) have attracted considerable attention because of their capability to effectively capture the complex relationships within the graph structures of data communications. Despite their promise, the reproducibility and replicability of these GIDS remain largely unexplored, posing challenges for developing reliable and robust detection systems. This study bridges this gap by designing a systematic approach to evaluate state-of-the-art GIDS, which includes critically assessing, extending, and clarifying the findings of these systems. We further assess the robustness of GIDS under adversarial attacks. Evaluations were conducted on three public datasets as well as a newly collected large-scale enterprise dataset. Our findings reveal significant performance discrepancies, highlighting challenges related to dataset scale, model inputs, and implementation settings. We demonstrate difficulties in reproducing and replicating results, particularly concerning false positive rates and robustness against adversarial attacks. This work provides valuable insights and recommendations for future research, emphasizing the importance of rigorous reproduction and replication studies in developing robust and generalizable GIDS solutions.</description>

      <title>Faster Parameter-Efficient Tuning with Token Redundancy Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient tuning (PET) aims to transfer pre-trained foundation models to downstream tasks by learning a small number of parameters. Compared to traditional fine-tuning, which updates the entire model, PET significantly reduces storage and transfer costs for each task regardless of exponentially increasing pre-trained model capacity. However, most PET methods inherit the inference latency of their large backbone models and often introduce additional computational overhead due to additional modules (e.g. adapters), limiting their practicality for compute-intensive applications. In this paper, we propose Faster Parameter-Efficient Tuning (FPET), a novel approach that enhances inference speed and training efficiency while maintaining high storage efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a plug-and-play token redundancy reduction module delicately designed for PET. This module refines tokens from the self-attention layer using an adapter to learn the accurate similarity between tokens and cuts off the tokens through a fully-differentiable token merging strategy, which uses a straight-through estimator for optimal token reduction. Experimental results prove that our FPET achieves faster inference and higher memory efficiency than the pre-trained backbone while keeping competitive performance on par with state-of-the-art PET methods.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Offline Reinforcement Learning with Adversarial Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-based offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) constructs environment models from offline datasets to perform conservative policy optimization. Existing approaches focus on learning state transitions through ensemble models, rollouting conservative estimation to mitigate extrapolation errors. However, the static data makes it challenging to develop a robust policy, and offline agents cannot access the environment to gather new data. To address these challenges, we introduce Model-based Offline Reinforcement learning with AdversariaL data augmentation (MORAL). In MORAL, we replace the fixed horizon rollout by employing adversaria data augmentation to execute alternating sampling with ensemble models to enrich training data. Specifically, this adversarial process dynamically selects ensemble models against policy for biased sampling, mitigating the optimistic estimation of fixed models, thus robustly expanding the training data for policy optimization. Moreover, a differential factor is integrated into the adversarial process for regularization, ensuring error minimization in extrapolations. This data-augmented optimization adapts to diverse offline tasks without rollout horizon tuning, showing remarkable applicability. Extensive experiments on D4RL benchmark demonstrate that MORAL outperforms other model-based offline RL methods in terms of policy learning and sample efficiency.</description>

      <title>QualiSpeech: A Speech Quality Assessment Dataset with Natural Language Reasoning and Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel perspective to speech quality assessment by leveraging natural language descriptions, offering richer, more nuanced insights than traditional numerical scoring methods. Natural language feedback provides instructive recommendations and detailed evaluations, yet existing datasets lack the comprehensive annotations needed for this approach. To bridge this gap, we introduce QualiSpeech, a comprehensive low-level speech quality assessment dataset encompassing 11 key aspects and detailed natural language comments that include reasoning and contextual insights. Additionally, we propose the QualiSpeech Benchmark to evaluate the low-level speech understanding capabilities of auditory large language models (LLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that finetuned auditory LLMs can reliably generate detailed descriptions of noise and distortion, effectively identifying their types and temporal characteristics. The results further highlight the potential for incorporating reasoning to enhance the accuracy and reliability of quality assessments. The dataset will be released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tsinghua-ee/QualiSpeech.</description>

      <title>CryoSAMU: Enhancing 3D Cryo-EM Density Maps of Protein Structures at Intermediate Resolution with Structure-Aware Multimodal U-Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) 3D density maps at intermediate resolution (4-8 {\AA}) is crucial in protein structure determination. Recent advances in deep learning have led to the development of automated approaches for enhancing experimental cryo-EM density maps. Yet, these methods are not optimized for intermediate-resolution maps and rely on map density features alone. To address this, we propose CryoSAMU, a novel method designed to enhance 3D cryo-EM density maps of protein structures using structure-aware multimodal U-Nets and trained on curated intermediate-resolution density maps. We comprehensively evaluate CryoSAMU across various metrics and demonstrate its competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, CryoSAMU achieves significantly faster processing speed, showing promise for future practical applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/chenwei-zhang/CryoSAMU.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Weakly Supervised Image Manipulation Localization with SAM Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Malicious image manipulation poses societal risks, increasing the importance of effective image manipulation detection methods. Recent approaches in image manipulation detection have largely been driven by fully supervised approaches, which require labor-intensive pixel-level annotations. Thus, it is essential to explore weakly supervised image manipulation localization methods that only require image-level binary labels for training. However, existing weakly supervised image manipulation methods overlook the importance of edge information for accurate localization, leading to suboptimal localization performance. To address this, we propose a Context-Aware Boundary Localization (CABL) module to aggregate boundary features and learn context-inconsistency for localizing manipulated areas. Furthermore, by leveraging Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and Segment Anything Model (SAM), we introduce the CAM-Guided SAM Refinement (CGSR) module to generate more accurate manipulation localization maps. By integrating two modules, we present a novel weakly supervised framework based on a dual-branch Transformer-CNN architecture. Our method achieves outstanding localization performance across multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>A Multilingual, Culture-First Approach to Addressing Misgendering in LLM Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Misgendering is the act of referring to someone by a gender that does not match their chosen identity. It marginalizes and undermines a person's sense of self, causing significant harm. English-based approaches have clear-cut approaches to avoiding misgendering, such as the use of the pronoun ``they''. However, other languages pose unique challenges due to both grammatical and cultural constructs. In this work we develop methodologies to assess and mitigate misgendering across 42 languages and dialects using a participatory-design approach to design effective and appropriate guardrails across all languages. We test these guardrails in a standard large language model-based application (meeting transcript summarization), where both the data generation and the annotation steps followed a human-in-the-loop approach. We find that the proposed guardrails are very effective in reducing misgendering rates across all languages in the summaries generated, and without incurring loss of quality. Our human-in-the-loop approach demonstrates a method to feasibly scale inclusive and responsible AI-based solutions across multiple languages and cultures.</description>

      <title>Iterative Prompting with Persuasion Skills in Jailbreaking Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are designed to align with human values in their responses. This study exploits LLMs with an iterative prompting technique where each prompt is systematically modified and refined across multiple iterations to enhance its effectiveness in jailbreaking attacks progressively. This technique involves analyzing the response patterns of LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa2, Vicuna, and ChatGLM, allowing us to adjust and optimize prompts to evade the LLMs' ethical and security constraints. Persuasion strategies enhance prompt effectiveness while maintaining consistency with malicious intent. Our results show that the attack success rates (ASR) increase as the attacking prompts become more refined with the highest ASR of 90% for GPT4 and ChatGLM and the lowest ASR of 68% for LLaMa2. Our technique outperforms baseline techniques (PAIR and PAP) in ASR and shows comparable performance with GCG and ArtPrompt.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Bayesian Optimization with Continuous Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of sequential data-driven decision-making under context distributional uncertainty. This problem arises in numerous real-world scenarios where the learner optimizes black-box objective functions in the presence of uncontrollable contextual variables. We consider the setting where the context distribution is uncertain but known to lie within an ambiguity set defined as a ball in the Wasserstein distance. We propose a novel algorithm for Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Bayesian Optimization that can handle continuous context distributions while maintaining computational tractability. Our theoretical analysis combines recent results in self-normalized concentration in Hilbert spaces and finite-sample bounds for distributionally robust optimization to establish sublinear regret bounds that match state-of-the-art results. Through extensive comparisons with existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world problems, we demonstrate the simplicity, effectiveness, and practical applicability of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>VideoGEM: Training-free Action Grounding in Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language foundation models have shown impressive capabilities across various zero-shot tasks, including training-free localization and grounding, primarily focusing on localizing objects in images. However, leveraging those capabilities to localize actions and events in videos is challenging, as actions have less physical outline and are usually described by higher-level concepts. In this work, we propose VideoGEM, the first training-free spatial action grounding method based on pretrained image- and video-language backbones. Namely, we adapt the self-self attention formulation of GEM to spatial activity grounding. We observe that high-level semantic concepts, such as actions, usually emerge in the higher layers of the image- and video-language models. We, therefore, propose a layer weighting in the self-attention path to prioritize higher layers. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic weighting method to automatically tune layer weights to capture each layer`s relevance to a specific prompt. Finally, we introduce a prompt decomposition, processing action, verb, and object prompts separately, resulting in a better spatial localization of actions. We evaluate the proposed approach on three image- and video-language backbones, CLIP, OpenCLIP, and ViCLIP, and on four video grounding datasets, V-HICO, DALY, YouCook-Interactions, and GroundingYouTube, showing that the proposed training-free approach is able to outperform current trained state-of-the-art approaches for spatial video grounding.</description>

      <title>MoLe-VLA: Dynamic Layer-skipping Vision Language Action Model via Mixture-of-Layers for Efficient Robot Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in understanding complex language and visual data, enabling generalist robotic systems to interpret instructions and perform embodied tasks. Nevertheless, their real-world deployment is hindered by substantial computational and storage demands. Recent insights into the homogeneous patterns in the LLM layer have inspired sparsification techniques to address these challenges, such as early exit and token pruning. However, these methods often neglect the critical role of the final layers that encode the semantic information most relevant to downstream robotic tasks. Aligning with the recent breakthrough of the Shallow Brain Hypothesis (SBH) in neuroscience and the mixture of experts in model sparsification, we conceptualize each LLM layer as an expert and propose a Mixture-of-Layers Vision-Language-Action model (MoLe-VLA, or simply MoLe) architecture for dynamic LLM layer activation. We introduce a Spatial-Temporal Aware Router (STAR) for MoLe to selectively activate only parts of the layers based on the robot's current state, mimicking the brain's distinct signal pathways specialized for cognition and causal reasoning. Additionally, to compensate for the cognitive ability of LLMs lost in MoLe, we devise a Cognition Self-Knowledge Distillation (CogKD) framework. CogKD enhances the understanding of task demands and improves the generation of task-relevant action sequences by leveraging cognitive features. Extensive experiments conducted in both RLBench simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the superiority of MoLe-VLA in both efficiency and performance. Specifically, MoLe-VLA achieves an 8% improvement in the mean success rate across ten tasks while reducing computational costs by up to x5.6 compared to standard LLMs.</description>

      <title>FastFT: Accelerating Reinforced Feature Transformation via Advanced Exploration Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature Transformation is crucial for classic machine learning that aims to generate feature combinations to enhance the performance of downstream tasks from a data-centric perspective. Current methodologies, such as manual expert-driven processes, iterative-feedback techniques, and exploration-generative tactics, have shown promise in automating such data engineering workflow by minimizing human involvement. However, three challenges remain in those frameworks: (1) It predominantly depends on downstream task performance metrics, as assessment is time-consuming, especially for large datasets. (2) The diversity of feature combinations will hardly be guaranteed after random exploration ends. (3) Rare significant transformations lead to sparse valuable feedback that hinders the learning processes or leads to less effective results. In response to these challenges, we introduce FastFT, an innovative framework that leverages a trio of advanced strategies.We first decouple the feature transformation evaluation from the outcomes of the generated datasets via the performance predictor. To address the issue of reward sparsity, we developed a method to evaluate the novelty of generated transformation sequences. Incorporating this novelty into the reward function accelerates the model's exploration of effective transformations, thereby improving the search productivity. Additionally, we combine novelty and performance to create a prioritized memory buffer, ensuring that essential experiences are effectively revisited during exploration. Our extensive experimental evaluations validate the performance, efficiency, and traceability of our proposed framework, showcasing its superiority in handling complex feature transformation tasks.</description>

      <title>Including local feature interactions in deep non-negative matrix factorization networks improves performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain uses positive signals as a means of signaling. Forward interactions in the early visual cortex are also positive, realized by excitatory synapses. Only local interactions also include inhibition. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) captures the biological constraint of positive long-range interactions and can be implemented with stochastic spikes. While NMF can serve as an abstract formalization of early neural processing in the visual system, the performance of deep convolutional networks with NMF modules does not match that of CNNs of similar size. However, when the local NMF modules are each followed by a module that mixes the NMF's positive activities, the performances on the benchmark data exceed that of vanilla deep convolutional networks of similar size. This setting can be considered a biologically more plausible emulation of the processing in cortical (hyper-)columns with the potential to improve the performance of deep networks.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Facial Expression Recognition Datasets for Deep Learning: A Benchmark Study with Novel Similarity Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the key characteristics and suitability of widely used Facial Expression Recognition (FER) datasets for training deep learning models. In the field of affective computing, FER is essential for interpreting human emotions, yet the performance of FER systems is highly contingent on the quality and diversity of the underlying datasets. To address this issue, we compiled and analyzed 24 FER datasets, including those targeting specific age groups such as children, adults, and the elderly, and processed them through a comprehensive normalization pipeline. In addition, we enriched the datasets with automatic annotations for age and gender, enabling a more nuanced evaluation of their demographic properties. To further assess dataset efficacy, we introduce three novel metricsLocal, Global, and Paired Similarity, which quantitatively measure dataset difficulty, generalization capability, and cross-dataset transferability. Benchmark experiments using state-of-the-art neural networks reveal that large-scale, automatically collected datasets (e.g., AffectNet, FER2013) tend to generalize better, despite issues with labeling noise and demographic biases, whereas controlled datasets offer higher annotation quality but limited variability. Our findings provide actionable recommendations for dataset selection and design, advancing the development of more robust, fair, and effective FER systems.</description>

      <title>Attention Xception UNet (AXUNet): A Novel Combination of CNN and Self-Attention for Brain Tumor Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of glioma brain tumors is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep learning techniques offer promising solutions, but optimal model architectures remain under investigation. We used the BraTS 2021 dataset, selecting T1 with contrast enhancement (T1CE), T2, and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) sequences for model development. The proposed Attention Xception UNet (AXUNet) architecture integrates an Xception backbone with dot-product self-attention modules, inspired by state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models such as Google Bard and OpenAI ChatGPT, within a UNet-shaped model. We compared AXUNet with SOTA models. Comparative evaluation on the test set demonstrated improved results over baseline models. Inception-UNet and Xception-UNet achieved mean Dice scores of 90.88 and 93.24, respectively. Attention ResUNet (AResUNet) attained a mean Dice score of 92.80, with the highest score of 84.92 for enhancing tumor (ET) among all models. Attention Gate UNet (AGUNet) yielded a mean Dice score of 90.38. AXUNet outperformed all models with a mean Dice score of 93.73. It demonstrated superior Dice scores across whole tumor (WT) and tumor core (TC) regions, achieving 92.59 for WT, 86.81 for TC, and 84.89 for ET. The integration of the Xception backbone and dot-product self-attention mechanisms in AXUNet showcases enhanced performance in capturing spatial and contextual information. The findings underscore the potential utility of AXUNet in facilitating precise tumor delineation.</description>

      <title>From Trial to Triumph: Advancing Long Video Understanding via Visual Context Sample Scaling and Self-reward Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal Large language models (MLLMs) show remarkable ability in video understanding. Nevertheless, understanding long videos remains challenging as the models can only process a finite number of frames in a single inference, potentially omitting crucial visual information. To address the challenge, we propose generating multiple predictions through visual context sampling, followed by a scoring mechanism to select the final prediction. Specifically, we devise a bin-wise sampling strategy that enables MLLMs to generate diverse answers based on various combinations of keyframes, thereby enriching the visual context. To determine the final prediction from the sampled answers, we employ a self-reward by linearly combining three scores: (1) a frequency score indicating the prevalence of each option, (2) a marginal confidence score reflecting the inter-intra sample certainty of MLLM predictions, and (3) a reasoning score for different question types, including clue-guided answering for global questions and temporal self-refocusing for local questions. The frequency score ensures robustness through majority correctness, the confidence-aligned score reflects prediction certainty, and the typed-reasoning score addresses cases with sparse key visual information using tailored strategies. Experiments show that this approach covers the correct answer for a high percentage of long video questions, on seven datasets show that our method improves the performance of three MLLMs.</description>

      <title>A multi-agentic framework for real-time, autonomous freeform metasurface design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Innovation in nanophotonics currently relies on human experts who synergize specialized knowledge in photonics and coding with simulation and optimization algorithms, entailing design cycles that are time-consuming, computationally demanding, and frequently suboptimal. We introduce MetaChat, a multi-agentic design framework that can translate semantically described photonic design goals into high-performance, freeform device layouts in an automated, nearly real-time manner. Multi-step reasoning is enabled by our Agentic Iterative Monologue (AIM) paradigm, which coherently interfaces agents with code-based tools, other specialized agents, and human designers. Design acceleration is facilitated by Feature-wise Linear Modulation-conditioned Maxwell surrogate solvers that support the generalized evaluation of metasurface structures. We use freeform dielectric metasurfaces as a model system and demonstrate with MetaChat the design of multi-objective, multi-wavelength metasurfaces orders of magnitude faster than conventional methods. These concepts present a scientific computing blueprint for utilizing specialist design agents, surrogate solvers, and human interactions to drive multi-physics innovation and discovery.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning Guided Latent Diffusion Model for Image-to-Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusion model has demonstrated superior performance in synthesizing diverse and high-quality images for text-guided image translation. However, there remains room for improvement in both the formulation of text prompts and the preservation of reference image content. First, variations in target text prompts can significantly influence the quality of the generated images, and it is often challenging for users to craft an optimal prompt that fully captures the content of the input image. Second, while existing models can introduce desired modifications to specific regions of the reference image, they frequently induce unintended alterations in areas that should remain unchanged. To address these challenges, we propose pix2pix-zeroCon, a zero-shot diffusion-based method that eliminates the need for additional training by leveraging patch-wise contrastive loss. Specifically, we automatically determine the editing direction in the text embedding space based on the reference image and target prompts. Furthermore, to ensure precise content and structural preservation in the edited image, we introduce cross-attention guiding loss and patch-wise contrastive loss between the generated and original image embeddings within a pre-trained diffusion model. Notably, our approach requires no additional training and operates directly on a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing models in image-to-image translation, achieving enhanced fidelity and controllability.</description>

      <title>Underwater Image Enhancement by Convolutional Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) is fundamental for marine applications, including autonomous vision-based navigation. Deep learning methods using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and vision transformers advanced UIE performance. Recently, spiking neural networks (SNN) have gained attention for their lightweight design, energy efficiency, and scalability. This paper introduces UIE-SNN, the first SNN-based UIE algorithm to improve visibility of underwater images. UIE-SNN is a 19- layered convolutional spiking encoder-decoder framework with skip connections, directly trained using surrogate gradient-based backpropagation through time (BPTT) strategy. We explore and validate the influence of training datasets on energy reduction, a unique advantage of UIE-SNN architecture, in contrast to the conventional learning-based architectures, where energy consumption is model-dependent. UIE-SNN optimizes the loss function in latent space representation to reconstruct clear underwater images. Our algorithm performs on par with its non-spiking counterpart methods in terms of PSNR and structural similarity index (SSIM) at reduced timesteps ($T=5$) and energy consumption of $85\%$. The algorithm is trained on two publicly available benchmark datasets, UIEB and EUVP, and tested on unseen images from UIEB, EUVP, LSUI, U45, and our custom UIE dataset. The UIE-SNN algorithm achieves PSNR of \(17.7801~dB\) and SSIM of \(0.7454\) on UIEB, and PSNR of \(23.1725~dB\) and SSIM of \(0.7890\) on EUVP. UIE-SNN achieves this algorithmic performance with fewer operators (\(147.49\) GSOPs) and energy (\(0.1327~J\)) compared to its non-spiking counterpart (GFLOPs = \(218.88\) and Energy=\(1.0068~J\)). Compared with existing SOTA UIE methods, UIE-SNN achieves an average of \(6.5\times\) improvement in energy efficiency.

      <title>Towards Efficient and General-Purpose Few-Shot Misclassification Detection for Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable prediction by classifiers is crucial for their deployment in high security and dynamically changing situations. However, modern neural networks often exhibit overconfidence for misclassified predictions, highlighting the need for confidence estimation to detect errors. Despite the achievements obtained by existing methods on small-scale datasets, they all require training from scratch and there are no efficient and effective misclassification detection (MisD) methods, hindering practical application towards large-scale and ever-changing datasets. In this paper, we pave the way to exploit vision language model (VLM) leveraging text information to establish an efficient and general-purpose misclassification detection framework. By harnessing the power of VLM, we construct FSMisD, a Few-Shot prompt learning framework for MisD to refrain from training from scratch and therefore improve tuning efficiency. To enhance misclassification detection ability, we use adaptive pseudo sample generation and a novel negative loss to mitigate the issue of overconfidence by pushing category prompts away from pseudo features. We conduct comprehensive experiments with prompt learning methods and validate the generalization ability across various datasets with domain shift. Significant and consistent improvement demonstrates the effectiveness, efficiency and generalizability of our approach.</description>

Abstract: Neural network-based receivers leverage deep learning to optimize signal detection and decoding, significantly improving bit-error rate (BER) and block-error rate (BLER) in challenging environments. This study evaluates various architectures and compares their BER and BLER performance across different noise levels. Two novel models, the Dual Attention Transformer (DAT) and the Residual Dual Non-Local Attention Network (RDNLA), integrate self-attention and residual learning to enhance signal reconstruction. These models bypass conventional channel estimation and equalization by directly predicting log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) from received signals, with noise variance as an additional input. Simulations show that DAT and RDNLA outperform traditional and other neural receiver models under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), while their computational efficiency supports their feasibility for next-generation communication systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models offer a scalable and flexible paradigm for simulating complex environments, yet current approaches fall short in addressing the domain-specific requirements of autonomous driving - such as multi-agent interactions, fine-grained control, and multi-camera consistency. We introduce GAIA-2, Generative AI for Autonomy, a latent diffusion world model that unifies these capabilities within a single generative framework. GAIA-2 supports controllable video generation conditioned on a rich set of structured inputs: ego-vehicle dynamics, agent configurations, environmental factors, and road semantics. It generates high-resolution, spatiotemporally consistent multi-camera videos across geographically diverse driving environments (UK, US, Germany). The model integrates both structured conditioning and external latent embeddings (e.g., from a proprietary driving model) to facilitate flexible and semantically grounded scene synthesis. Through this integration, GAIA-2 enables scalable simulation of both common and rare driving scenarios, advancing the use of generative world models as a core tool in the development of autonomous systems. Videos are available at https://wayve.ai/thinking/gaia-2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has spurred significant interest in tool learning, where LLMs are augmented with external tools to tackle complex tasks. However, existing tool environments face challenges in balancing stability, scalability, and realness, particularly for benchmarking purposes. To address this problem, we propose MirrorAPI, a novel framework that trains specialized LLMs to accurately simulate real API responses, effectively acting as "mirrors" to tool environments. Using a comprehensive dataset of request-response pairs from 7,000+ APIs, we employ supervised fine-tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance simulation fidelity. MirrorAPI achieves superior accuracy and stability compared to state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated by its performance on the newly constructed MirrorAPI-Bench and its integration into StableToolBench.</description>

      <title>A decision-theoretic approach to dealing with uncertainty in quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a decision-theoretic framework for dealing with uncertainty in quantum mechanics. This uncertainty is two-fold: on the one hand there may be uncertainty about the state the quantum system is in, and on the other hand, as is essential to quantum mechanical uncertainty, even if the quantum state is known, measurements may still produce an uncertain outcome. In our framework, measurements therefore play the role of acts with an uncertain outcome and our simple decision-theoretic postulates ensure that Born's rule is encapsulated in the utility functions associated with such acts. This approach allows us to uncouple (precise) probability theory from quantum mechanics, in the sense that it leaves room for a more general, so-called imprecise probabilities approach. We discuss the mathematical implications of our findings, which allow us to give a decision-theoretic foundation to recent seminal work by Benavoli, Facchini and Zaffalon, and we compare our approach to earlier and different approaches by Deutsch and Wallace.</description>

      <title>State-Aware Perturbation Optimization for Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for robotic control. However, the deployment of DRL in real-world robots is hindered by its sensitivity to environmental perturbations. While existing whitebox adversarial attacks rely on local gradient information and apply uniform perturbations across all states to evaluate DRL robustness, they fail to account for temporal dynamics and state-specific vulnerabilities. To combat the above challenge, we first conduct a theoretical analysis of white-box attacks in DRL by establishing the adversarial victim-dynamics Markov decision process (AVD-MDP), to derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a successful attack. Based on this, we propose a selective state-aware reinforcement adversarial attack method, named STAR, to optimize perturbation stealthiness and state visitation dispersion. STAR first employs a soft mask-based state-targeting mechanism to minimize redundant perturbations, enhancing stealthiness and attack effectiveness. Then, it incorporates an information-theoretic optimization objective to maximize mutual information between perturbations, environmental states, and victim actions, ensuring a dispersed state-visitation distribution that steers the victim agent into vulnerable states for maximum return reduction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAR outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Storytelling and LLM: A Linguistic Analysis of Automatically-Generated Role-Playing Game Sessions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Role-playing games (RPG) are games in which players interact with one another to create narratives. The role of players in the RPG is largely based on the interaction between players and their characters. This emerging form of shared narrative, primarily oral, is receiving increasing attention. In particular, many authors investigated the use of an LLM as an actor in the game. In this paper, we aim to discover to what extent the language of Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit oral or written features when asked to generate an RPG session without human interference. We will conduct a linguistic analysis of the lexical and syntactic features of the generated texts and compare the results with analyses of conversations, transcripts of human RPG sessions, and books. We found that LLMs exhibit a pattern that is distinct from all other text categories, including oral conversations, human RPG sessions and books. Our analysis has shown how training influences the way LLMs express themselves and provides important indications of the narrative capabilities of these tools.</description>

      <title>$\beta$-GNN: A Robust Ensemble Approach Against Graph Structure Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are playing an increasingly important role in the efficient operation and security of computing systems, with applications in workload scheduling, anomaly detection, and resource management. However, their vulnerability to network perturbations poses a significant challenge. We propose $\beta$-GNN, a model enhancing GNN robustness without sacrificing clean data performance. $\beta$-GNN uses a weighted ensemble, combining any GNN with a multi-layer perceptron. A learned dynamic weight, $\beta$, modulates the GNN's contribution. This $\beta$ not only weights GNN influence but also indicates data perturbation levels, enabling proactive mitigation. Experimental results on diverse datasets show $\beta$-GNN's superior adversarial accuracy and attack severity quantification. Crucially, $\beta$-GNN avoids perturbation assumptions, preserving clean data structure and performance.</description>

      <title>TN-Eval: Rubric and Evaluation Protocols for Measuring the Quality of Behavioral Therapy Notes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Behavioral therapy notes are important for both legal compliance and patient care. Unlike progress notes in physical health, quality standards for behavioral therapy notes remain underdeveloped. To address this gap, we collaborated with licensed therapists to design a comprehensive rubric for evaluating therapy notes across key dimensions: completeness, conciseness, and faithfulness. Further, we extend a public dataset of behavioral health conversations with therapist-written notes and LLM-generated notes, and apply our evaluation framework to measure their quality. We find that: (1) A rubric-based manual evaluation protocol offers more reliable and interpretable results than traditional Likert-scale annotations. (2) LLMs can mimic human evaluators in assessing completeness and conciseness but struggle with faithfulness. (3) Therapist-written notes often lack completeness and conciseness, while LLM-generated notes contain hallucination. Surprisingly, in a blind test, therapists prefer and judge LLM-generated notes to be superior to therapist-written notes.</description>

      <title>AccidentSim: Generating Physically Realistic Vehicle Collision Videos from Real-World Accident Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collecting real-world vehicle accident videos for autonomous driving research is challenging due to their rarity and complexity. While existing driving video generation methods may produce visually realistic videos, they often fail to deliver physically realistic simulations because they lack the capability to generate accurate post-collision trajectories. In this paper, we introduce AccidentSim, a novel framework that generates physically realistic vehicle collision videos by extracting and utilizing the physical clues and contextual information available in real-world vehicle accident reports. Specifically, AccidentSim leverages a reliable physical simulator to replicate post-collision vehicle trajectories from the physical and contextual information in the accident reports and to build a vehicle collision trajectory dataset. This dataset is then used to fine-tune a language model, enabling it to respond to user prompts and predict physically consistent post-collision trajectories across various driving scenarios based on user descriptions. Finally, we employ Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to render high-quality backgrounds, merging them with the foreground vehicles that exhibit physically realistic trajectories to generate vehicle collision videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the videos produced by AccidentSim excel in both visual and physical authenticity.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Forecasting for Network Resource Analysis in Integrated Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient resource management is critical for Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) to provide consistent, high-quality service in remote and under-served regions. While traditional single-point prediction methods, such as Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), have been used in terrestrial networks, they often fall short in NTNs due to the complexity of satellite dynamics, signal latency and coverage variability. Probabilistic forecasting, which quantifies the uncertainties of the predictions, is a robust alternative. In this paper, we evaluate the application of probabilistic forecasting techniques, in particular SFF, to NTN resource allocation scenarios. Our results show their effectiveness in predicting bandwidth and capacity requirements in different NTN segments of probabilistic forecasting compared to single-point prediction techniques such as LSTM. The results show the potential of black probabilistic forecasting models to provide accurate and reliable predictions and to quantify their uncertainty, making them indispensable for optimizing NTN resource allocation. At the end of the paper, we also present application scenarios and a standardization roadmap for the use of probabilistic forecasting in integrated Terrestrial Network (TN)-NTN environments.</description>

      <title>Flip Learning: Weakly Supervised Erase to Segment Nodules in Breast Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of nodules in both 2D breast ultrasound (BUS) and 3D automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Therefore, developing an automated system for nodule segmentation can enhance user independence and expedite clinical analysis. Unlike fully-supervised learning, weakly-supervised segmentation (WSS) can streamline the laborious and intricate annotation process. However, current WSS methods face challenges in achieving precise nodule segmentation, as many of them depend on inaccurate activation maps or inefficient pseudo-mask generation algorithms. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning-based WSS framework called Flip Learning, which relies solely on 2D/3D boxes for accurate segmentation. Specifically, multiple agents are employed to erase the target from the box to facilitate classification tag flipping, with the erased region serving as the predicted segmentation mask. The key contributions of this research are as follows: (1) Adoption of a superpixel/supervoxel-based approach to encode the standardized environment, capturing boundary priors and expediting the learning process. (2) Introduction of three meticulously designed rewards, comprising a classification score reward and two intensity distribution rewards, to steer the agents' erasing process precisely, thereby avoiding both under- and over-segmentation. (3) Implementation of a progressive curriculum learning strategy to enable agents to interact with the environment in a progressively challenging manner, thereby enhancing learning efficiency. Extensively validated on the large in-house BUS and ABUS datasets, our Flip Learning method outperforms state-of-the-art WSS methods and foundation models, and achieves comparable performance as fully-supervised learning algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence becomes more and more ingrained in daily life, we present a novel system that uses deep learning for music recommendation and emotion-based detection. Through the use of facial recognition and the DeepFace framework, our method analyses human emotions in real-time and then plays music that reflects the mood it has discovered. The system uses a webcam to take pictures, analyses the most common facial expression, and then pulls a playlist from local storage that corresponds to the mood it has detected. An engaging and customised experience is ensured by allowing users to manually change the song selection via a dropdown menu or navigation buttons. By continuously looping over the playlist, the technology guarantees continuity. The objective of our system is to improve emotional well-being through music therapy by offering a responsive and automated music-selection experience.</description>

      <title>Quantum Neural Network Restatement of Markov Jump Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the many challenges in exploratory data analysis, artificial neural networks have motivated strong interests in scientists and researchers both in theoretical as well as practical applications. Among sources of such popularity of artificial neural networks the ability of modeling non-linear dynamical systems, generalization, and adaptation possibilities should be mentioned. Despite this, there is still significant debate about the role of various underlying stochastic processes in stabilizing a unique structure for data learning and prediction. One of such obstacles to the theoretical and numerical study of machine intelligent systems is the curse of dimensionality and the sampling from high-dimensional probability distributions. In general, this curse prevents efficient description of states, providing a significant complexity barrier for the system to be efficiently described and studied. In this strand of research, direct treatment and description of such abstract notions of learning theory in terms of quantum information be one of the most favorable candidates. Hence, the subject matter of these articles is devoted to problems of design, adaptation and the formulations of computationally hard problems in terms of quantum mechanical systems. In order to characterize the microscopic description of such dynamics in the language of inferential statistics, covariance matrix estimation of d-dimensional Gaussian densities and Bayesian interpretation of eigenvalue problem for dynamical systems is assessed.</description>

      <title>High Quality Diffusion Distillation on a Single GPU with Relative and Absolute Position Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce relative and absolute position matching (RAPM), a diffusion distillation method resulting in high quality generation that can be trained efficiently on a single GPU. Recent diffusion distillation research has achieved excellent results for high-resolution text-to-image generation with methods such as phased consistency models (PCM) and improved distribution matching distillation (DMD2). However, these methods generally require many GPUs (e.g.~8-64) and significant batchsizes (e.g.~128-2048) during training, resulting in memory and compute requirements that are beyond the resources of some researchers. RAPM provides effective single-GPU diffusion distillation training with a batchsize of 1. The new method attempts to mimic the sampling trajectories of the teacher model by matching the relative and absolute positions. The design of relative positions is inspired by PCM. Two discriminators are introduced accordingly in RAPM, one for matching relative positions and the other for absolute positions. Experimental results on StableDiffusion (SD) V1.5 and SDXL indicate that RAPM with 4 timesteps produces comparable FID scores as the best method with 1 timestep under very limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scaling Laws for Efficiency Gains in a Theoretical Transformer-Augmented Sectional MoE Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a theoretical framework for a Transformer-augmented, sectional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that aims to enhance computational efficiency while preserving model scalability. Unlike conventional MoE models, which route entire token embeddings to selected experts, our approach portions the embedding dimension itself -- assigning segments of each token's representation to dedicated experts. To combat losses in token representation, we utilize a pre-expert transformer layer to recompute attention across tokens and reduce the sequence length dimensionality. We extend our theory by deriving optimal scaling laws that a non-linear relationship between the number of experts and factors such as model dimensionality, sequence length, and system overhead. These formulations yield closed-form and numerically-solvable expressions for identifying the optimal expert count under given architectural and hardware constraints. As a result, our framework not only provides theoretical bounds for computing efficiency with varying frameworks but also guides practical design choices for scaling large models effectively. While empirical validation is pending, we present a comprehensive experimental road map to evaluate the framework's efficiency, scalability, and practicality in future work.</description>

      <title>Reason-RFT: Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Visual Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual reasoning abilities play a crucial role in understanding complex multimodal data, advancing both domain-specific applications and artificial general intelligence (AGI). Existing methods improve VLM reasoning via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning, using meticulously annotated training data to enhance visual reasoning capabilities. However, this training paradigm may lead to overfitting and cognitive rigidity, restricting the model's ability to transfer visual reasoning skills across domains and limiting its real-world applicability. To address these limitations, we propose Reason-RFT, a novel reinforcement fine-tuning framework that significantly enhances generalization capabilities in visual reasoning tasks. Reason-RFT introduces a two-phase training framework for visual reasoning: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with curated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data activates the reasoning potential of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), followed by (2) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based reinforcement learning that generates multiple reasoning-response pairs, significantly enhancing generalization in visual reasoning tasks. To evaluate Reason-RFT's visual reasoning capabilities, we reconstructed a comprehensive dataset spanning visual counting, structure perception, and spatial transformation.cExperimental results demonstrate Reasoning-RFT's three key advantages: (1) Performance Enhancement: achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple tasks, outperforming most mainstream open-source and proprietary models; (2) Generalization Superiority: consistently maintaining robust performance across diverse tasks and domains, outperforming alternative training paradigms; (3) Data Efficiency: excelling in few-shot learning scenarios while surpassing full-dataset SFT baselines.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promise in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). However, their direct application to ADS is hindered by challenges such as misunderstanding of traffic knowledge, complex road conditions, and diverse states of vehicle. To address these challenges, we propose the use of Knowledge Editing, which enables targeted modifications to a model's behavior without the need for full retraining. Meanwhile, we introduce ADS-Edit, a multimodal knowledge editing dataset specifically designed for ADS, which includes various real-world scenarios, multiple data types, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive experiments and derive several interesting conclusions. We hope that our work will contribute to the further advancement of knowledge editing applications in the field of autonomous driving.

      <title>Understanding R1-Zero-Like Training: A Critical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DeepSeek-R1-Zero has shown that reinforcement learning (RL) at scale can directly enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs without supervised fine-tuning. In this work, we critically examine R1-Zero-like training by analyzing its two core components: base models and RL. We investigate a wide range of base models, including DeepSeek-V3-Base, to understand how pretraining characteristics influence RL performance. Our analysis reveals that DeepSeek-V3-Base already exhibit ''Aha moment'', while Qwen2.5 base models demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities even without prompt templates, suggesting potential pretraining biases. Additionally, we identify an optimization bias in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which artificially increases response length (especially for incorrect outputs) during training. To address this, we introduce Dr. GRPO, an unbiased optimization method that improves token efficiency while maintaining reasoning performance. Leveraging these insights, we present a minimalist R1-Zero recipe that achieves 43.3% accuracy on AIME 2024 with a 7B base model, establishing a new state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/understand-r1-zero.</description>

      <title>Mobile-MMLU: A Mobile Intelligence Language Understanding Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have increased interest in deploying them on mobile devices for on-device AI applications. Mobile users interact differently with LLMs compared to desktop users, creating unique expectations and data biases. Current benchmark datasets primarily target at server and desktop environments, and there is a notable lack of extensive datasets specifically designed for mobile contexts. Additionally, mobile devices face strict limitations in storage and computing resources, constraining model size and capabilities, thus requiring optimized efficiency and prioritized knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce Mobile-MMLU, a large-scale benchmark dataset tailored for mobile intelligence. It consists of 16,186 questions across 80 mobile-related fields, designed to evaluate LLM performance in realistic mobile scenarios. A challenging subset, Mobile-MMLU-Pro, provides advanced evaluation similar in size to MMLU-Pro but significantly more difficult than our standard full set. Both benchmarks use multiple-choice, order-invariant questions focused on practical mobile interactions, such as recipe suggestions, travel planning, and essential daily tasks. The dataset emphasizes critical mobile-specific metrics like inference latency, energy consumption, memory usage, and response quality, offering comprehensive insights into model performance under mobile constraints. Moreover, it prioritizes privacy and adaptability, assessing models' ability to perform on-device processing, maintain user privacy, and adapt to personalized usage patterns. Mobile-MMLU family offers a standardized framework for developing and comparing mobile-optimized LLMs, enabling advancements in productivity and decision-making within mobile computing environments.

      <title>FREIDA: A Framework for developing quantitative agent based models based on qualitative expert knowledge: an example of organised crime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing ABMs of organized crime networks supports law enforcement strategies but is often limited by scarce quantitative data. This challenge extends to other psychosocial contexts like mental health and social systems. While qualitative data from reports and interviews is more accessible, current ABM methodologies struggle to integrate both data types effectively. To address this, we propose FREIDA, a mixed-methods framework that combines qualitative and quantitative data to develop, train, and validate ABMs in data-sparse contexts. FREIDA's four-phase process includes data acquisition, conceptual modeling, computational implementation, and model assessment. Using Thematic Content Analysis (TCA), Expected System Behaviors (ESBs) are translated into Training Statements (TS) for calibration and Validation Statements (VS) for assessment. Iterative sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification refine the model's accuracy. We apply FREIDA to a case study of the Netherlands cocaine network, producing the Criminal Cocaine Replacement Model (CCRM) to simulate kingpin removal dynamics. FREIDA enables robust ABM development with limited data, aiding law enforcement decisions and resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Truck Parking Usage Prediction with Decomposed Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Truck parking on freight corridors faces the major challenge of insufficient parking spaces. This is exacerbated by the Hour-of-Service (HOS) regulations, which often result in unauthorized parking practices, causing safety concerns. It has been shown that providing accurate parking usage prediction can be a cost-effective solution to reduce unsafe parking practices. In light of this, existing studies have developed various methods to predict the usage of a truck parking site and have demonstrated satisfactory accuracy. However, these studies focused on a single parking site, and few approaches have been proposed to predict the usage of multiple truck parking sites considering spatio-temporal dependencies, due to the lack of data. This paper aims to fill this gap and presents the Regional Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RegT-GCN) to predict parking usage across the entire state to provide more comprehensive truck parking information. The framework leverages the topological structures of truck parking site locations and historical parking data to predict the occupancy rate considering spatio-temporal dependencies across a state. To achieve this, we introduce a Regional Decomposition approach, which effectively captures the geographical characteristics of the truck parking locations and their spatial correlations. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other baseline models, showing the effectiveness of our regional decomposition.

      <title>TwoStep: Multi-agent Task Planning using Classical Planners and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical planning formulations like the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) admit action sequences guaranteed to achieve a goal state given an initial state if any are possible. However, reasoning problems defined in PDDL do not capture temporal aspects of action taking, such as concurrent actions between two agents when there are no conflicting conditions, without significant modification and definition to existing PDDL domains. A human expert aware of such constraints can decompose a goal into subgoals, each reachable through single agent planning, to take advantage of simultaneous actions. In contrast to classical planning, large language models (LLMs) directly used for inferring plan steps rarely guarantee execution success, but are capable of leveraging commonsense reasoning to assemble action sequences. We combine the strengths of both classical planning and LLMs by approximating human intuitions for multi-agent planning goal decomposition. We demonstrate that LLM-based goal decomposition leads to faster planning times than solving multi-agent PDDL problems directly while simultaneously achieving fewer plan execution steps than a single agent plan alone, as well as most multiagent plans, while guaranteeing execution success. Additionally, we find that LLM-based approximations of subgoals result in similar multi-agent execution lengths to those specified by human experts.

      <title>Socratic Planner: Self-QA-Based Zero-Shot Planning for Embodied Instruction Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) is the task of executing natural language instructions by navigating and interacting with objects in interactive environments. A key challenge in EIF is compositional task planning, typically addressed through supervised learning or few-shot in-context learning with labeled data. To this end, we introduce the Socratic Planner, a self-QA-based zero-shot planning method that infers an appropriate plan without any further training. The Socratic Planner first facilitates self-questioning and answering by the Large Language Model (LLM), which in turn helps generate a sequence of subgoals. While executing the subgoals, an embodied agent may encounter unexpected situations, such as unforeseen obstacles. The Socratic Planner then adjusts plans based on dense visual feedback through a visually-grounded re-planning mechanism. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the Socratic Planner, outperforming current state-of-the-art planning models on the ALFRED benchmark across all metrics, particularly excelling in long-horizon tasks that demand complex inference. We further demonstrate its real-world applicability through deployment on a physical robot for long-horizon tasks.</description>

      <title>Fully Distributed Fog Load Balancing with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time Internet of Things (IoT) applications require real-time support to handle the ever-growing demand for computing resources to process IoT workloads. Fog Computing provides high availability of such resources in a distributed manner. However, these resources must be efficiently managed to distribute unpredictable traffic demands among heterogeneous Fog resources. This paper proposes a fully distributed load-balancing solution with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) that intelligently distributes IoT workloads to optimize the waiting time while providing fair resource utilization in the Fog network. These agents use transfer learning for life-long self-adaptation to dynamic changes in the environment. By leveraging distributed decision-making, MARL agents effectively minimize the waiting time compared to a single centralized agent solution and other baselines, enhancing end-to-end execution delay. Besides performance gain, a fully distributed solution allows for a global-scale implementation where agents can work independently in small collaboration regions, leveraging nearby local resources. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of a realistic frequency to observe the state of the environment, unlike the unrealistic common assumption in the literature of having observations readily available in real-time for every required action. The findings highlight the trade-off between realism and performance using an interval-based Gossip-based multi-casting protocol against assuming real-time observation availability for every generated workload.</description>

      <title>Medical-GAT: Cancer Document Classification Leveraging Graph-Based Residual Network for Scenarios with Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate classification of cancer-related medical abstracts is crucial for healthcare management and research. However, obtaining large, labeled datasets in the medical domain is challenging due to privacy concerns and the complexity of clinical data. This scarcity of annotated data impedes the development of effective machine learning models for cancer document classification. To address this challenge, we present a curated dataset of 1,874 biomedical abstracts, categorized into thyroid cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, and generic topics. Our research focuses on leveraging this dataset to improve classification performance, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. We introduce a Residual Graph Attention Network (R-GAT) with multiple graph attention layers that capture the semantic information and structural relationships within cancer-related documents. Our R-GAT model is compared with various techniques, including transformer-based models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), RoBERTa, and domain-specific models like BioBERT and Bio+ClinicalBERT. We also evaluated deep learning models (CNNs, LSTMs) and traditional machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM). Additionally, we explore ensemble approaches that combine deep learning models to enhance classification. Various feature extraction methods are assessed, including Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) with unigrams and bigrams, Word2Vec, and tokenizers from BERT and RoBERTa. The R-GAT model outperforms other techniques, achieving precision, recall, and F1 scores of 0.99, 0.97, and 0.98 for thyroid cancer; 0.96, 0.94, and 0.95 for colon cancer; 0.96, 0.99, and 0.97 for lung cancer; and 0.95, 0.96, and 0.95 for generic topics.</description>

      <title>Human Motion Instruction Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16805v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents LLaMo (Large Language and Human Motion Assistant), a multimodal framework for human motion instruction tuning. In contrast to conventional instruction-tuning approaches that convert non-linguistic inputs, such as video or motion sequences, into language tokens, LLaMo retains motion in its native form for instruction tuning. This method preserves motion-specific details that are often diminished in tokenization, thereby improving the model's ability to interpret complex human behaviors. By processing both video and motion data alongside textual inputs, LLaMo enables a flexible, human-centric analysis. Experimental evaluations across high-complexity domains, including human behaviors and professional activities, indicate that LLaMo effectively captures domain-specific knowledge, enhancing comprehension and prediction in motion-intensive scenarios. We hope LLaMo offers a foundation for future multimodal AI systems with broad applications, from sports analytics to behavioral prediction.

      <title>Beyond Outlining: Heterogeneous Recursive Planning for Adaptive Long-form Writing with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-form writing agents require flexible integration and interaction across information retrieval, reasoning, and composition. Current approaches rely on predetermined workflows and rigid thinking patterns to generate outlines before writing, resulting in constrained adaptability during writing. In this paper we propose a general agent framework that achieves human-like adaptive writing through recursive task decomposition and dynamic integration of three fundamental task types, i.e. retrieval, reasoning, and composition. Our methodology features: 1) a planning mechanism that interleaves recursive task decomposition and execution, eliminating artificial restrictions on writing workflow; and 2) integration of task types that facilitates heterogeneous task decomposition. Evaluations on both fiction writing and technical report generation show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all automatic evaluation metrics, which demonstrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of our proposed framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-agent application system designed to enhance office collaboration efficiency and work quality. The system integrates artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing technologies, achieving functionalities such as task allocation, progress monitoring, and information sharing. The agents within the system are capable of providing personalized collaboration support based on team members' needs and incorporate data analysis tools to improve decision-making quality. The paper also proposes an intelligent agent architecture that separates Plan and Solver, and through techniques such as multi-turn query rewriting and business tool retrieval, it enhances the agent's multi-intent and multi-turn dialogue capabilities. Furthermore, the paper details the design of tools and multi-turn dialogue in the context of office collaboration scenarios, and validates the system's effectiveness through experiments and evaluations. Ultimately, the system has demonstrated outstanding performance in real business applications, particularly in query understanding, task planning, and tool calling. Looking forward, the system is expected to play a more significant role in addressing complex interaction issues within dynamic environments and large-scale multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Robust Experts (MoRE):A Robust Denoising Method towards multiple perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.10586v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To tackle the susceptibility of deep neural networks to adversarial examples, the adversarial training has been proposed which provides a notion of security through an inner maximization problem presenting the first-order adversaries embedded within the outer minimization of the training loss. To generalize the adversarial robustness over different perturbation types, the adversarial training method has been augmented with the improved inner maximization presenting a union of multiple perturbations e.g., various $\ell_p$ norm-bounded perturbations. However, the improved inner maximization only enjoys limited flexibility in terms of the allowable perturbation types. In this work, through a gating mechanism, we assemble a set of expert networks, each one either adversarially trained to deal with a particular perturbation type or normally trained for boosting accuracy on clean data. The gating module assigns weights dynamically to each expert to achieve superior accuracy under various data types e.g., adversarial examples, adverse weather perturbations, and clean input. In order to deal with the obfuscated gradients issue, the training of the gating module is conducted together with fine-tuning of the last fully connected layers of expert networks through adversarial training approach. Using extensive experiments, we show that our Mixture of Robust Experts (MoRE) approach enables a flexible integration of a broad range of robust experts with superior performance.</description>

      <title>Making AI Less "Thirsty": Uncovering and Addressing the Secret Water Footprint of AI Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03271v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing carbon footprint of artificial intelligence (AI) has been undergoing public scrutiny. Nonetheless, the equally important water (withdrawal and consumption) footprint of AI has largely remained under the radar. For example, training the GPT-3 language model in Microsoft's state-of-the-art U.S. data centers can directly evaporate 700,000 liters of clean freshwater, but such information has been kept a secret. More critically, the global AI demand is projected to account for 4.2-6.6 billion cubic meters of water withdrawal in 2027, which is more than the total annual water withdrawal of 4-6 Denmark or half of the United Kingdom. This is concerning, as freshwater scarcity has become one of the most pressing challenges. To respond to the global water challenges, AI can, and also must, take social responsibility and lead by example by addressing its own water footprint. In this paper, we provide a principled methodology to estimate the water footprint of AI, and also discuss the unique spatial-temporal diversities of AI's runtime water efficiency. Finally, we highlight the necessity of holistically addressing water footprint along with carbon footprint to enable truly sustainable AI.</description>

      <title>Elastic Federated Learning over Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) for Concurrent Execution of Multiple Distributed Learning Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02109v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a popular distributed machine learning (ML) technique in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where resource-constrained devices collaboratively train ML models while preserving data privacy. However, implementation of FL over 5G-and-beyond wireless networks faces key challenges caused by (i) dynamics of the wireless network conditions and (ii) the coexistence of multiple FL-services in the system. In this paper, we unveil two key phenomena that arise from these challenges: over/under-provisioning of resources and perspective-driven load balancing, both of which significantly impact FL performance in IoT environments. We take the first steps towards addressing these phenomena by proposing a novel distributed ML architecture called elastic FL (EFL). EFL unleashes the full potential of Open RAN (O-RAN) systems and introduces an elastic resource provisioning methodology to execute FL-services. It further constitutes a multi-time-scale FL management system that introduces three dedicated network control functionalities tailored for FL-services, including (i) non-real-time (non-RT) system descriptor, which trains ML-based applications to predict both system and FL-related dynamics and parameters; (ii) near-RT FL controller, which handles O-RAN slicing and mobility management for the seamless execution of FL-services; (iii) FL MAC scheduler, which conducts real-time resource allocation to the end clients of various FL-services. We finally prototype EFL to demonstrate its potential in improving the performance of FL-services.</description>

      <title>Certified Robustness via Dynamic Margin Maximization and Improved Lipschitz Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00116v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To improve the robustness of deep classifiers against adversarial perturbations, many approaches have been proposed, such as designing new architectures with better robustness properties (e.g., Lipschitz-capped networks), or modifying the training process itself (e.g., min-max optimization, constrained learning, or regularization). These approaches, however, might not be effective at increasing the margin in the input (feature) space. As a result, there has been an increasing interest in developing training procedures that can directly manipulate the decision boundary in the input space. In this paper, we build upon recent developments in this category by developing a robust training algorithm whose objective is to increase the margin in the output (logit) space while regularizing the Lipschitz constant of the model along vulnerable directions. We show that these two objectives can directly promote larger margins in the input space. To this end, we develop a scalable method for calculating guaranteed differentiable upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant of neural networks accurately and efficiently. The relative accuracy of the bounds prevents excessive regularization and allows for more direct manipulation of the decision boundary. Furthermore, our Lipschitz bounding algorithm exploits the monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity of the activation layers, and the resulting bounds can be used to design new layers with controllable bounds on their Lipschitz constant. Experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Tiny-ImageNet data sets verify that our proposed algorithm obtains competitively improved results compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Semiring Provenance for Lightweight Description Logics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate semiring provenance--a successful framework originally defined in the relational database setting--for description logics. In this context, the ontology axioms are annotated with elements of a commutative semiring and these annotations are propagated to the ontology consequences in a way that reflects how they are derived. We define a provenance semantics for a language that encompasses several lightweight description logics and show its relationships with semantics that have been defined for ontologies annotated with a specific kind of annotation (such as fuzzy degrees). We show that under some restrictions on the semiring, the semantics satisfies desirable properties (such as extending the semiring provenance defined for databases). We then focus on the well-known why-provenance, for which we study the complexity of problems related to the provenance of an assertion or a conjunctive query answer. Finally, we consider two more restricted cases which correspond to the so-called positive Boolean provenance and lineage in the database setting. For these cases, we exhibit relationships with well-known notions related to explanations in description logics and complete our complexity analysis. As a side contribution, we provide conditions on an $\mathcal{ELHI}_\bot$ ontology that guarantee tractable reasoning.</description>

      <title>Graph-Instructed Neural Networks for Sparse Grid-Based Discontinuity Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13652v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting the discontinuity interfaces of a discontinuous function. This approach leverages Graph-Instructed Neural Networks (GINNs) and sparse grids to address discontinuity detection also in domains of dimension larger than 3. GINNs, trained to identify troubled points on sparse grids, exploit graph structures built on the grids to achieve efficient and accurate discontinuity detection performances. We also introduce a recursive algorithm for general sparse grid-based detectors, characterized by convergence properties and easy applicability. Numerical experiments on functions with dimensions n = 2 and n = 4 demonstrate the efficiency and robust generalization properties of GINNs in detecting discontinuity interfaces. Notably, the trained GINNs offer portability and versatility, allowing integration into various algorithms and sharing among users.</description>

      <title>Lemur: Log Parsing with Entropy Sampling and Chain-of-Thought Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18205v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Logs produced by extensive software systems are integral to monitoring system behaviors. Advanced log analysis facilitates the detection, alerting, and diagnosis of system faults. Log parsing, which entails transforming raw log messages into structured templates, constitutes a critical phase in the automation of log analytics. Existing log parsers fail to identify the correct templates due to reliance on human-made rules. Besides, these methods focus on statistical features while ignoring semantic information in log messages. To address these challenges, we introduce a cutting-edge \textbf{L}og parsing framework with \textbf{E}ntropy sampling and chain-of-thought \textbf{M}erging (\model{}). Specifically, to discard the tedious manual rules, we propose a novel sampling method inspired by information entropy, which efficiently clusters typical logs. Furthermore, to enhance the merging of log templates, we design a chain-of-thought method for large language models (LLMs). LLMs exhibit exceptional semantic comprehension and deftly distinguish between parameters and invariant tokens. We have conducted experiments on large-scale public datasets. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that \model{} achieves state-of-the-art performance and impressive efficiency. The Code is available at https://github.com/zwpride/lemur.</description>

      <title>Motion-Boundary-Driven Unsupervised Surgical Instrument Segmentation in Low-Quality Optical Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised video-based surgical instrument segmentation has the potential to accelerate the adoption of robot-assisted procedures by reducing the reliance on manual annotations. However, the generally low quality of optical flow in endoscopic footage poses a great challenge for unsupervised methods that rely heavily on motion cues. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach that pinpoints motion boundaries, regions with abrupt flow changes, while selectively discarding frames with globally low-quality flow and adapting to varying motion patterns. Experiments on the EndoVis2017 VOS and EndoVis2017 Challenge datasets show that our method achieves mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) scores of 0.75 and 0.72, respectively, effectively alleviating the constraints imposed by suboptimal optical flow. This enables a more scalable and robust surgical instrument segmentation solution in clinical settings. The code will be publicly released.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07900v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread application of LLMs across various tasks and fields has necessitated the alignment of these models with human values and preferences. Given various approaches of human value alignment, there is an urgent need to understand the scope and nature of human values injected into these LLMs before their deployment and adoption. We propose UniVaR, a high-dimensional neural representation of symbolic human value distributions in LLMs, orthogonal to model architecture and training data. This is a continuous and scalable representation, self-supervised from the value-relevant output of 8 LLMs and evaluated on 15 open-source and commercial LLMs. Through UniVaR, we visualize and explore how LLMs prioritize different values in 25 languages and cultures, shedding light on complex interplay between human values and language modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing utilization of surveillance cameras in smart cities, coupled with the surge of online video applications, has heightened concerns regarding public security and privacy protection, which propelled automated Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) into a fundamental research task within the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community. With the advancements in deep learning and edge computing, VAD has made significant progress and advances synergized with emerging applications in smart cities and video internet, which has moved beyond the conventional research scope of algorithm engineering to deployable Networking Systems for VAD (NSVAD), a practical hotspot for intersection exploration in the AI, IoVT, and computing fields. In this article, we delineate the foundational assumptions, learning frameworks, and applicable scenarios of various deep learning-driven VAD routes, offering an exhaustive tutorial for novices in NSVAD. In addition, this article elucidates core concepts by reviewing recent advances and typical solutions and aggregating available research resources accessible at https://github.com/fdjingliu/NSVAD. Lastly, this article projects future development trends and discusses how the integration of AI and computing technologies can address existing research challenges and promote open opportunities, serving as an insightful guide for prospective researchers and engineers.</description>

      <title>ManiCM: Real-time 3D Diffusion Policy via Consistency Model for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been verified to be effective in generating complex distributions from natural images to motion trajectories. Recent diffusion-based methods show impressive performance in 3D robotic manipulation tasks, whereas they suffer from severe runtime inefficiency due to multiple denoising steps, especially with high-dimensional observations. To this end, we propose a real-time robotic manipulation model named ManiCM that imposes the consistency constraint to the diffusion process, so that the model can generate robot actions in only one-step inference. Specifically, we formulate a consistent diffusion process in the robot action space conditioned on the point cloud input, where the original action is required to be directly denoised from any point along the ODE trajectory. To model this process, we design a consistency distillation technique to predict the action sample directly instead of predicting the noise within the vision community for fast convergence in the low-dimensional action manifold. We evaluate ManiCM on 31 robotic manipulation tasks from Adroit and Metaworld, and the results demonstrate that our approach accelerates the state-of-the-art method by 10 times in average inference speed while maintaining competitive average success rate.</description>

      <title>Data Augmentation in Earth Observation: A Diffusion Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-quality Earth Observation (EO) imagery is essential for accurate analysis and informed decision making across sectors. However, data scarcity caused by atmospheric conditions, seasonal variations, and limited geographical coverage hinders the effective application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in EO. Traditional data augmentation techniques, which rely on basic parameterized image transformations, often fail to introduce sufficient diversity across key semantic axes. These axes include natural changes such as snow and floods, human impacts like urbanization and roads, and disasters such as wildfires and storms, which limits the accuracy of AI models in EO applications. To address this, we propose a four-stage data augmentation approach that integrates diffusion models to enhance semantic diversity. Our method employs meta-prompts for instruction generation, vision-language models for rich captioning, EO-specific diffusion model fine-tuning, and iterative data augmentation. Extensive experiments using four augmentation techniques demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms established methods, generating semantically diverse EO images and improving AI model performance.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Domain Generalization with Feature Structuralization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-grained domain generalization (FGDG) is a more challenging task than traditional DG tasks due to its small inter-class variations and relatively large intra-class disparities. When domain distribution changes, the vulnerability of subtle features leads to a severe deterioration in model performance. Nevertheless, humans inherently demonstrate the capacity for generalizing to out-of-distribution data, leveraging structured multi-granularity knowledge that emerges from discerning the commonality and specificity within categories. Likewise, we propose a Feature Structuralized Domain Generalization (FSDG) model, wherein features experience structuralization into common, specific, and confounding segments, harmoniously aligned with their relevant semantic concepts, to elevate performance in FGDG. Specifically, feature structuralization (FS) is accomplished through joint optimization of five constraints: a decorrelation function applied to disentangled segments, three constraints ensuring common feature consistency and specific feature distinctiveness, and a prediction calibration term. By imposing these stipulations, FSDG is prompted to disentangle and align features based on multi-granularity knowledge, facilitating robust subtle distinctions among categories. Extensive experimentation on three benchmarks consistently validates the superiority of FSDG over state-of-the-art counterparts, with an average improvement of 6.2% in FGDG performance. Beyond that, the explainability analysis on explicit concept matching intensity between the shared concepts among categories and the model channels, along with experiments on various mainstream model architectures, substantiates the validity of FS.</description>

      <title>Fantastic Copyrighted Beasts and How (Not) to Generate Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies show that image and video generation models can be prompted to reproduce copyrighted content from their training data, raising serious legal concerns about copyright infringement. Copyrighted characters (e.g., Mario, Batman) present a significant challenge: at least one lawsuit has already awarded damages based on the generation of such characters. Consequently, commercial services like DALL-E have started deploying interventions. However, little research has systematically examined these problems: (1) Can users easily prompt models to generate copyrighted characters, even if it is unintentional?; (2) How effective are the existing mitigation strategies? To address these questions, we introduce a novel evaluation framework with metrics that assess both the generated image's similarity to copyrighted characters and its consistency with user intent, grounded in a set of popular copyrighted characters from diverse studios and regions. We show that state-of-the-art image and video generation models can still generate characters even if characters' names are not explicitly mentioned, sometimes with only two generic keywords (e.g., prompting with "videogame, plumber" consistently generates Nintendo's Mario character). We also introduce semi-automatic techniques to identify such keywords or descriptions that trigger character generation. Using this framework, we evaluate mitigation strategies, including prompt rewriting and new approaches we propose. Our findings reveal that common methods, such as DALL-E's prompt rewriting, are insufficient alone and require supplementary strategies like negative prompting. Our work provides empirical grounding for discussions on copyright mitigation strategies and offers actionable insights for model deployers implementing these safeguards.</description>

      <title>BRIGHT: A Realistic and Challenging Benchmark for Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12883v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing retrieval benchmarks primarily consist of information-seeking queries (e.g., aggregated questions from search engines) where keyword or semantic-based retrieval is usually sufficient. However, many complex real-world queries require in-depth reasoning to identify relevant documents that go beyond surface form matching. For example, finding documentation for a coding question requires understanding the logic and syntax of the functions involved. To better benchmark retrieval on such challenging queries, we introduce BRIGHT, the first text retrieval benchmark that requires intensive reasoning to retrieve relevant documents. Our dataset consists of 1,384 real-world queries spanning diverse domains, such as economics, psychology, mathematics, and coding. These queries are drawn from naturally occurring and carefully curated human data. Extensive evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art retrieval models perform poorly on BRIGHT. The leading model on the MTEB leaderboard (Muennighoff et al., 2023) SFR-Embedding-Mistral (Meng et al., 2024), which achieves a score of 59.0 nDCG@10,1 produces a score of nDCG@10 of 18.3 on BRIGHT. We show that incorporating explicit reasoning about the query improves retrieval performance by up to 12.2 points. Moreover, incorporating retrieved documents from the top-performing retriever boosts question-answering performance. We believe that BRIGHT paves the way for future research on retrieval systems in more realistic and challenging settings.</description>

      <title>General-purpose Clothes Manipulation with Semantic Keypoints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clothes manipulation is a critical capability for household robots; yet, existing methods are often confined to specific tasks, such as folding or flattening, due to the complex high-dimensional geometry of deformable fabric. This paper presents CLothes mAnipulation with Semantic keyPoints (CLASP) for general-purpose clothes manipulation, which enables the robot to perform diverse manipulation tasks over different types of clothes. The key idea of CLASP is semantic keypoints -- e.g., "right shoulder", "left sleeve", etc. -- a sparse spatial-semantic representation that is salient for both perception and action. Semantic keypoints of clothes can be effectively extracted from depth images and are sufficient to represent a broad range of clothes manipulation policies. CLASP leverages semantic keypoints to bridge LLM-powered task planning and low-level action execution in a two-level hierarchy. Extensive simulation experiments show that CLASP outperforms baseline methods across diverse clothes types in both seen and unseen tasks. Further, experiments with a Kinova dual-arm system on four distinct tasks -- folding, flattening, hanging, and placing -- confirm CLASP's performance on a real robot.</description>

      <title>Retro-li: Small-Scale Retrieval Augmented Generation Supporting Noisy Similarity Searches and Domain Shift Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system such as Retro has been shown to improve language modeling capabilities and reduce toxicity and hallucinations by retrieving from a database of non-parametric memory containing trillions of entries. We introduce Retro-li that shows retrieval can also help using a small-scale database, but it demands more accurate and better neighbors when searching in a smaller hence sparser non-parametric memory. This can be met by using a proper semantic similarity search. We further propose adding a regularization to the non-parametric memory for the first time: it significantly reduces perplexity when the neighbor search operations are noisy during inference, and it improves generalization when a domain shift occurs. We also show that Retro-li's non-parametric memory can potentially be implemented on analog in-memory computing hardware, exhibiting O(1) search time while causing noise in retrieving neighbors, with minimal (&lt;1%) performance loss. Our code is available at: https://github.com/IBM/Retrieval-Enhanced-Transformer-Little.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Action Sequence Learning for Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03132v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing a universal policy architecture that performs well across diverse robots and task configurations remains a key challenge. In this work, we address this by representing robot actions as sequential data and generating actions through autoregressive sequence modeling. Existing autoregressive architectures generate end-effector waypoints sequentially as word tokens in language modeling, which are limited to low-frequency control tasks. Unlike language, robot actions are heterogeneous and often include continuous values -- such as joint positions, 2D pixel coordinates, and end-effector poses -- which are not easily suited for language-based modeling. Based on this insight, we introduce a straightforward enhancement: we extend causal transformers' single-token prediction to support predicting a variable number of tokens in a single step through our Chunking Causal Transformer (CCT). This enhancement enables robust performance across diverse tasks of various control frequencies, greater efficiency by having fewer autoregression steps, and lead to a hybrid action sequence design by mixing different types of actions and using a different chunk size for each action type. Based on CCT, we propose the Autoregressive Policy (ARP) architecture, which solves manipulation tasks by generating hybrid action sequences. We evaluate ARP across diverse robotic manipulation environments, including Push-T, ALOHA, and RLBench, and show that ARP, as a universal architecture, matches or outperforms the environment-specific state-of-the-art in all tested benchmarks, while being more efficient in computation and parameter sizes. Videos of our real robot demonstrations, all source code and the pretrained models of ARP can be found at http://github.com/mlzxy/arp.</description>

Abstract: Talking head generation intends to produce vivid and realistic talking head videos from a single portrait and speech audio clip. Although significant progress has been made in diffusion-based talking head generation, almost all methods rely on autoregressive strategies, which suffer from limited context utilization beyond the current generation step, error accumulation, and slower generation speed. To address these challenges, we present DAWN (Dynamic frame Avatar With Non-autoregressive diffusion), a framework that enables all-at-once generation of dynamic-length video sequences. Specifically, it consists of two main components: (1) audio-driven holistic facial dynamics generation in the latent motion space, and (2) audio-driven head pose and blink generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates authentic and vivid videos with precise lip motions, and natural pose/blink movements. Additionally, with a high generation speed, DAWN possesses strong extrapolation capabilities, ensuring the stable production of high-quality long videos. These results highlight the considerable promise and potential impact of DAWN in the field of talking head video generation. Furthermore, we hope that DAWN sparks further exploration of non-autoregressive approaches in diffusion models. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Hanbo-Cheng/DAWN-pytorch.</description>

Abstract: Diagnosing and treating skin diseases require advanced visual skills across domains and the ability to synthesize information from multiple imaging modalities. While current deep learning models excel at specific tasks like skin cancer diagnosis from dermoscopic images, they struggle to meet the complex, multimodal requirements of clinical practice. Here, we introduce PanDerm, a multimodal dermatology foundation model pretrained through self-supervised learning on over 2 million real-world skin disease images from 11 clinical institutions across 4 imaging modalities. We evaluated PanDerm on 28 diverse benchmarks, including skin cancer screening, risk stratification, differential diagnosis of common and rare skin conditions, lesion segmentation, longitudinal monitoring, and metastasis prediction and prognosis. PanDerm achieved state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated tasks, often outperforming existing models when using only 10% of labeled data. We conducted three reader studies to assess PanDerm's potential clinical utility. PanDerm outperformed clinicians by 10.2% in early-stage melanoma detection through longitudinal analysis, improved clinicians' skin cancer diagnostic accuracy by 11% on dermoscopy images, and enhanced non-dermatologist healthcare providers' differential diagnosis by 16.5% across 128 skin conditions on clinical photographs. These results demonstrate PanDerm's potential to improve patient care across diverse clinical scenarios and serve as a model for developing multimodal foundation models in other medical specialties, potentially accelerating the integration of AI support in healthcare.</description>

      <title>Bonsai: Gradient-free Graph Condensation for Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17579v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph condensation has emerged as a promising avenue to enable scalable training of GNNs by compressing the training dataset while preserving essential graph characteristics. Our study uncovers significant shortcomings in current graph condensation techniques. First, the majority of the algorithms paradoxically require training on the full dataset to perform condensation. Second, due to their gradient-emulating approach, these methods require fresh condensation for any change in hyperparameters or GNN architecture, limiting their flexibility and reusability. Finally, they fail to achieve substantial size reduction due to synthesizing fully-connected, edge-weighted graphs. To address these challenges, we present Bonsai, a novel graph condensation method empowered by the observation that \textit{computation trees} form the fundamental processing units of message-passing GNNs. Bonsai condenses datasets by encoding a careful selection of \textit{exemplar} trees that maximize the representation of all computation trees in the training set. This unique approach imparts Bonsai as the first linear-time, model-agnostic graph condensation algorithm for node classification that outperforms existing baselines across $7$ real-world datasets on accuracy, while being $22$ times faster on average. Bonsai is grounded in rigorous mathematical guarantees on the adopted approximation strategies making it robust to GNN architectures, datasets, and parameters.</description>

      <title>Two pathways to resolve relational inconsistencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When individuals encounter observations that violate their expectations, when will they adjust their expectations and when will they maintain them despite these observations? For example, when individuals expect objects of type A to be smaller than objects B, but observe the opposite, when will they adjust their expectation about the relationship between the two objects (to A being larger than B)? Naively, one would predict that the larger the violation, the greater the adaptation. However, experiments reveal that when violations are extreme, individuals are more likely to hold on to their prior expectations rather than adjust them. To address this puzzle, we tested the adaptation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) capable of relational learning and found a similar phenomenon: Standard learning dynamics dictates that small violations would lead to adjustments of expected relations while larger ones would be resolved using a different mechanism -- a change in object representation that bypasses the need for adaptation of the relational expectations. These results suggest that the experimentally-observed stability of prior expectations when facing large expectation violations is a natural consequence of learning dynamics and does not require any additional mechanisms. We conclude by discussing the effect of intermediate adaptation steps on this stability.</description>

      <title>MC-LLaVA: Multi-Concept Personalized Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) show exceptional abilities across diverse tasks, such as visual question answering. To enhance user experience, recent studies investigate VLM personalization to understand user-provided concepts. However, they mainly focus on single-concept personalization, neglecting the existence and interplay of multiple concepts, which limits real-world applicability. This paper proposes the first multi-concept personalization paradigm, MC-LLaVA. Specifically, MC-LLaVA employs a multi-concept instruction tuning strategy, effectively integrating multiple concepts in a single training step. To reduce the costs related to joint training, we propose a personalized textual prompt that uses visual token information to initialize concept tokens. Additionally, we introduce a personalized visual prompt during inference, aggregating location confidence maps for enhanced recognition and grounding capabilities. To advance multi-concept personalization research, we further contribute a high-quality instruction tuning dataset. We carefully collect images with multiple characters and objects from movies and manually generate question-answer samples for multi-concept scenarios, featuring superior diversity. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that MC-LLaVA can achieve impressive multi-concept personalized responses, paving the way for VLMs to become better user-specific assistants. The code and dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/arctanxarc/MC-LLaVA.</description>

      <title>The importance of the clustering model to detect new types of intrusion in data traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the current digital age, the volume of data generated by various cyber activities has become enormous and is constantly increasing. The data may contain valuable insights that can be harnessed to improve cyber security measures. However, much of this data is unclassified and qualitative, which poses significant challenges to traditional analysis methods. Clustering facilitates the identification of hidden patterns and structures in data through grouping similar data points, which makes it simpler to identify and address threats. Clustering can be defined as a data mining (DM) approach, which uses similarity calculations for dividing a data set into several categories. Hierarchical, density-based, along with partitioning clustering algorithms are typical. The presented work use K-means algorithm, which is a popular clustering technique. Utilizing K-means algorithm, we worked with two different types of data: first, we gathered data with the use of XG-boost algorithm following completing the aggregation with K-means algorithm. Data was gathered utilizing Kali Linux environment, cicflowmeter traffic, and Putty Software tools with the use of diverse and simple attacks. The concept could assist in identifying new attack types, which are distinct from the known attacks, and labeling them based on the characteristics they will exhibit, as the dynamic nature regarding cyber threats means that new attack types often emerge, for which labeled data might not yet exist. The model counted the attacks and assigned numbers to each one of them. Secondly, We tried the same work on the ready data inside the Kaggle repository called (Intrusion Detection in Internet of Things Network), and the clustering model worked well and detected the number of attacks correctly as shown in the results section.</description>

      <title>TopV-Nav: Unlocking the Top-View Spatial Reasoning Potential of MLLM for Zero-shot Object Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Zero-Shot Object Navigation (ZSON) task requires embodied agents to find a previously unseen object by navigating in unfamiliar environments. Such a goal-oriented exploration heavily relies on the ability to perceive, understand, and reason based on the spatial information of the environment. However, current LLM-based approaches convert visual observations to language descriptions and reason in the linguistic space, leading to the loss of spatial information. In this paper, we introduce TopV-Nav, an MLLM-based method that directly reasons on the top-view map with sufficient spatial information. To fully unlock the MLLM's spatial reasoning potential in top-view perspective, we propose the Adaptive Visual Prompt Generation (AVPG) method to adaptively construct semantically-rich top-view map. It enables the agent to directly utilize spatial information contained in the top-view map to conduct thorough reasoning. Besides, we design a Dynamic Map Scaling (DMS) mechanism to dynamically zoom top-view map at preferred scales, enhancing local fine-grained reasoning. Additionally, we devise a Potential Target Driven (PTD) mechanism to predict and to utilize target locations, facilitating global and human-like exploration. Experiments on MP3D and HM3D datasets demonstrate the superiority of our TopV-Nav.</description>

      <title>RoboSpatial: Teaching Spatial Understanding to 2D and 3D Vision-Language Models for Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial understanding is a crucial capability that enables robots to perceive their surroundings, reason about their environment, and interact with it meaningfully. In modern robotics, these capabilities are increasingly provided by vision-language models. However, these models face significant challenges in spatial reasoning tasks, as their training data are based on general-purpose image datasets that often lack sophisticated spatial understanding. For example, datasets frequently do not capture reference frame comprehension, yet effective spatial reasoning requires understanding whether to reason from ego-, world-, or object-centric perspectives. To address this issue, we introduce RoboSpatial, a large-scale dataset for spatial understanding in robotics. It consists of real indoor and tabletop scenes, captured as 3D scans and egocentric images, and annotated with rich spatial information relevant to robotics. The dataset includes 1M images, 5k 3D scans, and 3M annotated spatial relationships, and the pairing of 2D egocentric images with 3D scans makes it both 2D- and 3D- ready. Our experiments show that models trained with RoboSpatial outperform baselines on downstream tasks such as spatial affordance prediction, spatial relationship prediction, and robot manipulation.</description>

      <title>Inference-Time Policy Steering through Human Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative policies trained with human demonstrations can autonomously accomplish multimodal, long-horizon tasks. However, during inference, humans are often removed from the policy execution loop, limiting the ability to guide a pre-trained policy towards a specific sub-goal or trajectory shape among multiple predictions. Naive human intervention may inadvertently exacerbate distribution shift, leading to constraint violations or execution failures. To better align policy output with human intent without inducing out-of-distribution errors, we propose an Inference-Time Policy Steering (ITPS) framework that leverages human interactions to bias the generative sampling process, rather than fine-tuning the policy on interaction data. We evaluate ITPS across three simulated and real-world benchmarks, testing three forms of human interaction and associated alignment distance metrics. Among six sampling strategies, our proposed stochastic sampling with diffusion policy achieves the best trade-off between alignment and distribution shift.

      <title>MARVEL-40M+: Multi-Level Visual Elaboration for High-Fidelity Text-to-3D Content Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D content from text prompts remains a significant challenge in computer vision due to the limited size, diversity, and annotation depth of the existing datasets. To address this, we introduce MARVEL-40M+, an extensive dataset with 40 million text annotations for over 8.9 million 3D assets aggregated from seven major 3D datasets. Our contribution is a novel multi-stage annotation pipeline that integrates open-source pretrained multi-view VLMs and LLMs to automatically produce multi-level descriptions, ranging from detailed (150-200 words) to concise semantic tags (10-20 words). This structure supports both fine-grained 3D reconstruction and rapid prototyping. Furthermore, we incorporate human metadata from source datasets into our annotation pipeline to add domain-specific information in our annotation and reduce VLM hallucinations. Additionally, we develop MARVEL-FX3D, a two-stage text-to-3D pipeline. We fine-tune Stable Diffusion with our annotations and use a pretrained image-to-3D network to generate 3D textured meshes within 15s. Extensive evaluations show that MARVEL-40M+ significantly outperforms existing datasets in annotation quality and linguistic diversity, achieving win rates of 72.41% by GPT-4 and 73.40% by human evaluators.

      <title>COSMOS: Cross-Modality Self-Distillation for Vision Language Pre-training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained with contrastive loss have achieved significant advancements in various vision and language tasks. However, the global nature of the contrastive loss makes VLMs focus predominantly on foreground objects, neglecting other crucial information in the image, which limits their effectiveness in downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose COSMOS: CrOSs-MOdality Self-distillation for vision-language pre-training that integrates a novel text-cropping strategy and cross-attention module into a self-supervised learning framework. We create global and local views of images and texts (i.e., multi-modal augmentations), which are essential for self-distillation in VLMs. We further introduce a cross-attention module, enabling COSMOS to learn comprehensive cross-modal representations optimized via a cross-modality self-distillation loss. COSMOS consistently outperforms previous strong baselines on various zero-shot downstream tasks, including retrieval, classification, and semantic segmentation. Additionally, it surpasses CLIP-based models trained on larger datasets in visual perception and contextual understanding tasks.

      <title>Black-Box Forgery Attacks on Semantic Watermarks for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating watermarking into the generation process of latent diffusion models (LDMs) simplifies detection and attribution of generated content. Semantic watermarks, such as Tree-Rings and Gaussian Shading, represent a novel class of watermarking techniques that are easy to implement and highly robust against various perturbations. However, our work demonstrates a fundamental security vulnerability of semantic watermarks. We show that attackers can leverage unrelated models, even with different latent spaces and architectures (UNet vs DiT), to perform powerful and realistic forgery attacks. Specifically, we design two watermark forgery attacks. The first imprints a targeted watermark into real images by manipulating the latent representation of an arbitrary image in an unrelated LDM to get closer to the latent representation of a watermarked image. We also show that this technique can be used for watermark removal. The second attack generates new images with the target watermark by inverting a watermarked image and re-generating it with an arbitrary prompt. Both attacks just need a single reference image with the target watermark. Overall, our findings question the applicability of semantic watermarks by revealing that attackers can easily forge or remove these watermarks under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Intuitive Axial Augmentation Using Polar-Sine-Based Piecewise Distortion for Medical Slice-Wise Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most data-driven models for medical image analysis rely on universal augmentations to improve accuracy. Experimental evidence has confirmed their effectiveness, but the unclear mechanism underlying them poses a barrier to the widespread acceptance and trust in such methods within the medical community. We revisit and acknowledge the unique characteristics of medical images apart from traditional digital images, and consequently, proposed a medical-specific augmentation algorithm that is more elastic and aligns well with radiology scan procedure. The method performs piecewise affine with sinusoidal distorted ray according to radius on polar coordinates, thus simulating uncertain postures of human lying flat on the scanning table. Our method could generate human visceral distribution without affecting the fundamental relative position on axial plane. Two non-adaptive algorithms, namely Meta-based Scan Table Removal and Similarity-Guided Parameter Search, are introduced to bolster robustness of our augmentation method. In contrast to other methodologies, our method is highlighted for its intuitive design and ease of understanding for medical professionals, thereby enhancing its applicability in clinical scenarios. Experiments show our method improves accuracy with two modality across multiple famous segmentation frameworks without requiring more data samples.

Abstract: We introduce DEIM, an innovative and efficient training framework designed to accelerate convergence in real-time object detection with Transformer-based architectures (DETR). To mitigate the sparse supervision inherent in one-to-one (O2O) matching in DETR models, DEIM employs a Dense O2O matching strategy. This approach increases the number of positive samples per image by incorporating additional targets, using standard data augmentation techniques. While Dense O2O matching speeds up convergence, it also introduces numerous low-quality matches that could affect performance. To address this, we propose the Matchability-Aware Loss (MAL), a novel loss function that optimizes matches across various quality levels, enhancing the effectiveness of Dense O2O. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset validate the efficacy of DEIM. When integrated with RT-DETR and D-FINE, it consistently boosts performance while reducing training time by 50%. Notably, paired with RT-DETRv2, DEIM achieves 53.2% AP in a single day of training on an NVIDIA 4090 GPU. Additionally, DEIM-trained real-time models outperform leading real-time object detectors, with DEIM-D-FINE-L and DEIM-D-FINE-X achieving 54.7% and 56.5% AP at 124 and 78 FPS on an NVIDIA T4 GPU, respectively, without the need for additional data. We believe DEIM sets a new baseline for advancements in real-time object detection. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/ShihuaHuang95/DEIM.</description>

      <title>Forest-of-Thought: Scaling Test-Time Compute for Enhancing LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09078v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities across various language tasks, but solving complex reasoning problems remains a significant challenge. While existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), enhance reasoning by decomposing problems or structuring prompts, they typically perform a single pass of reasoning and may fail to revisit flawed paths, compromising accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Forest-of-Thought (FoT), which integrates multiple reasoning trees to leverage collective decision-making for solving complex logical problems. FoT employs sparse activation strategies to select the most relevant reasoning paths, improving both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic self-correction strategy that enables real-time error correction, along with consensus-guided decision-making strategies to optimize both correctness and computational resources. Experimental results demonstrate that the FoT framework, combined with these strategies, significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to solve complex tasks with greater precision and efficiency. Code will be available at https://github.com/iamhankai/Forest-of-Thought.</description>

      <title>DiTCtrl: Exploring Attention Control in Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Tuning-Free Multi-Prompt Longer Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sora-like video generation models have achieved remarkable progress with a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer MM-DiT architecture. However, the current video generation models predominantly focus on single-prompt, struggling to generate coherent scenes with multiple sequential prompts that better reflect real-world dynamic scenarios. While some pioneering works have explored multi-prompt video generation, they face significant challenges including strict training data requirements, weak prompt following, and unnatural transitions. To address these problems, we propose DiTCtrl, a training-free multi-prompt video generation method under MM-DiT architectures for the first time. Our key idea is to take the multi-prompt video generation task as temporal video editing with smooth transitions. To achieve this goal, we first analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism, finding that the 3D full attention behaves similarly to that of the cross/self-attention blocks in the UNet-like diffusion models, enabling mask-guided precise semantic control across different prompts with attention sharing for multi-prompt video generation. Based on our careful design, the video generated by DiTCtrl achieves smooth transitions and consistent object motion given multiple sequential prompts without additional training. Besides, we also present MPVBench, a new benchmark specially designed for multi-prompt video generation to evaluate the performance of multi-prompt generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without additional training.</description>

      <title>Towards End-to-End Neuromorphic Voxel-based 3D Object Reconstruction Without Physical Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic cameras, also known as event cameras, are asynchronous brightness-change sensors that can capture extremely fast motion without suffering from motion blur, making them particularly promising for 3D reconstruction in extreme environments. However, existing research on 3D reconstruction using monocular neuromorphic cameras is limited, and most of the methods rely on estimating physical priors and employ complex multi-step pipelines. In this work, we propose an end-to-end method for dense voxel 3D reconstruction using neuromorphic cameras that eliminates the need to estimate physical priors. Our method incorporates a novel event representation to enhance edge features, enabling the proposed feature-enhancement model to learn more effectively. Additionally, we introduced Optimal Binarization Threshold Selection Principle as a guideline for future related work, using the optimal reconstruction results achieved with threshold optimization as the benchmark. Our method achieves a 54.6% improvement in reconstruction accuracy compared to the baseline method.</description>

      <title>HLV-1K: A Large-scale Hour-Long Video Benchmark for Time-Specific Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models have become a popular topic in deep visual understanding due to many promising real-world applications. However, hour-long video understanding, spanning over one hour and containing tens of thousands of visual frames, remains under-explored because of 1) challenging long-term video analyses, 2) inefficient large-model approaches, and 3) lack of large-scale benchmark datasets. Among them, in this paper, we focus on building a large-scale hour-long long video benchmark, HLV-1K, designed to evaluate long video understanding models. HLV-1K comprises 1009 hour-long videos with 14,847 high-quality question answering (QA) and multi-choice question asnwering (MCQA) pairs with time-aware query and diverse annotations, covering frame-level, within-event-level, cross-event-level, and long-term reasoning tasks. We evaluate our benchmark using existing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate its value for testing deep long video understanding capabilities at different levels and for various tasks. This includes promoting future long video understanding tasks at a granular level, such as deep understanding of long live videos, meeting recordings, and movies.</description>

      <title>TransPlace: Transferable Circuit Global Placement via Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global placement, a critical step in designing the physical layout of computer chips, is essential to optimize chip performance. Prior global placement methods optimize each circuit design individually from scratch. Their neglect of transferable knowledge limits solution efficiency and chip performance as circuit complexity drastically increases. This study presents TransPlace, a global placement framework that learns to place millions of mixed-size cells in continuous space. TransPlace introduces i) Netlist Graph to efficiently model netlist topology, ii) Cell-flow and relative position encoding to learn SE(2)-invariant representation, iii) a tailored graph neural network architecture for informed parameterization of placement knowledge, and iv) a two-stage strategy for coarse-to-fine placement. Compared to state-of-the-art placement methods, TransPlace-trained on a few high-quality placements-can place unseen circuits with 1.2x speedup while reducing congestion by 30%, timing by 9%, and wirelength by 5%.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Code Embedding Framework for High-Precision Ransomware Detection via Multimodal Execution Path Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern threat landscapes continue to evolve with increasing sophistication, challenging traditional detection methodologies and necessitating innovative solutions capable of addressing complex adversarial tactics. A novel framework was developed to identify ransomware activity through multimodal execution path analysis, integrating high-dimensional embeddings and dynamic heuristic derivation mechanisms to capture behavioral patterns across diverse attack variants. The approach demonstrated high adaptability, effectively mitigating obfuscation strategies and polymorphic characteristics often employed by ransomware families to evade detection. Comprehensive experimental evaluations revealed significant advancements in precision, recall, and accuracy metrics compared to baseline techniques, particularly under conditions of variable encryption speeds and obfuscated execution flows. The framework achieved scalable and computationally efficient performance, ensuring robust applicability across a range of system configurations, from resource-constrained environments to high-performance infrastructures. Notable findings included reduced false positive rates and enhanced detection latency, even for ransomware families employing sophisticated encryption mechanisms. The modular design allowed seamless integration of additional modalities, enabling extensibility and future-proofing against emerging threat vectors. Quantitative analyses further highlighted the system's energy efficiency, emphasizing its practicality for deployment in environments with stringent operational constraints. The results underline the importance of integrating advanced computational techniques and dynamic adaptability to safeguard digital ecosystems from increasingly complex threats.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Semantic Recomposition Mechanism for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context-aware processing mechanisms have increasingly become a critical area of exploration for improving the semantic and contextual capabilities of language generation models. The Context-Aware Semantic Recomposition Mechanism (CASRM) was introduced as a novel framework designed to address limitations in coherence, contextual adaptability, and error propagation in large-scale text generation tasks. Through the integration of dynamically generated context vectors and attention modulation layers, CASRM enhances the alignment between token-level representations and broader contextual dependencies. Experimental evaluations demonstrated significant improvements in semantic coherence across multiple domains, including technical, conversational, and narrative text. The ability to adapt to unseen domains and ambiguous inputs was evaluated using a diverse set of test scenarios, highlighting the robustness of the proposed mechanism. A detailed computational analysis revealed that while CASRM introduces additional processing overhead, the gains in linguistic precision and contextual relevance outweigh the marginal increase in complexity. The framework also successfully mitigates error propagation in sequential tasks, improving performance in dialogue continuation and multi-step text synthesis. Additional investigations into token-level attention distribution emphasized the dynamic focus shifts enabled through context-aware enhancements. The findings suggest that CASRM offers a scalable and flexible solution for integrating contextual intelligence into existing language model architectures.</description>

      <title>MMGDreamer: Mixed-Modality Graph for Geometry-Controllable 3D Indoor Scene Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controllable 3D scene generation has extensive applications in virtual reality and interior design, where the generated scenes should exhibit high levels of realism and controllability in terms of geometry. Scene graphs provide a suitable data representation that facilitates these applications. However, current graph-based methods for scene generation are constrained to text-based inputs and exhibit insufficient adaptability to flexible user inputs, hindering the ability to precisely control object geometry. To address this issue, we propose MMGDreamer, a dual-branch diffusion model for scene generation that incorporates a novel Mixed-Modality Graph, visual enhancement module, and relation predictor. The mixed-modality graph allows object nodes to integrate textual and visual modalities, with optional relationships between nodes. It enhances adaptability to flexible user inputs and enables meticulous control over the geometry of objects in the generated scenes. The visual enhancement module enriches the visual fidelity of text-only nodes by constructing visual representations using text embeddings. Furthermore, our relation predictor leverages node representations to infer absent relationships between nodes, resulting in more coherent scene layouts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MMGDreamer exhibits superior control of object geometry, achieving state-of-the-art scene generation performance.

      <title>MetaDE: Evolving Differential Evolution by Differential Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a cornerstone in the Evolutionary Computation (EC) domain, Differential Evolution (DE) is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling challenging black-box optimization problems. While the advantages of DE are well-recognized, achieving peak performance heavily depends on its hyperparameters such as the mutation factor, crossover probability, and the selection of specific DE strategies. Traditional approaches to this hyperparameter dilemma have leaned towards parameter tuning or adaptive mechanisms. However, identifying the optimal settings tailored for specific problems remains a persistent challenge. In response, we introduce MetaDE, an approach that evolves DE's intrinsic hyperparameters and strategies using DE itself at a meta-level. A pivotal aspect of MetaDE is a specialized parameterization technique, which endows it with the capability to dynamically modify DE's parameters and strategies throughout the evolutionary process. To augment computational efficiency, MetaDE incorporates a design that leverages parallel processing through a GPU-accelerated computing framework. Within such a framework, DE is not just a solver but also an optimizer for its own configurations, thus streamlining the process of hyperparameter optimization and problem-solving into a cohesive and automated workflow. Extensive evaluations on the CEC2022 benchmark suite demonstrate MetaDE's promising performance. Moreover, when applied to robot control via evolutionary reinforcement learning, MetaDE also demonstrates promising performance. The source code of MetaDE is publicly accessible at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/metade.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown surprising proficiency in generating code snippets, promising to automate large parts of software engineering via artificial intelligence (AI). We argue that successfully deploying AI software engineers requires a level of trust equal to or even greater than the trust established by human-driven software engineering practices. The recent trend toward LLM agents offers a path toward integrating the power of LLMs to create new code with the power of analysis tools to increase trust in the code. This opinion piece comments on whether LLM agents could dominate software engineering workflows in the future and whether the focus of programming will shift from programming at scale to programming with trust.</description>

      <title>VesselSAM: Leveraging SAM for Aortic Vessel Segmentation with LoRA and Atrous Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18185v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, especially when dealing with complex anatomical structures such as vessels. However, accurately segmenting vessels remains challenging due to their small size, intricate edge structures, and susceptibility to artifacts and imaging noise. In this work, we propose VesselSAM, an enhanced version of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), specifically tailored for aortic vessel segmentation. VesselSAM incorporates AtrousLoRA, a novel module integrating Atrous Attention and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to enhance segmentation performance. Atrous Attention enables the model to capture multi-scale contextual information, preserving both fine-grained local details and broader global context. Additionally, LoRA facilitates efficient fine-tuning of the frozen SAM image encoder, reducing the number of trainable parameters and thereby enhancing computational efficiency. We evaluate VesselSAM using two challenging datasets: the Aortic Vessel Tree (AVT) dataset and the Type-B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) dataset. VesselSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining DSC scores of 93.50\%, 93.25\%, 93.02\%, and 93.26\% across multi-center datasets. Our results demonstrate that VesselSAM delivers high segmentation accuracy while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to existing large-scale models. This development paves the way for enhanced AI-based aortic vessel segmentation in clinical environments. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/Adnan-CAS/AtrousLora.</description>

      <title>END: Early Noise Dropping for Efficient and Effective Context Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, they are often distracted by irrelevant or noisy context in input sequences that degrades output quality. This problem affects both long- and short-context scenarios, such as retrieval-augmented generation, table question-answering, and in-context learning. We reveal that LLMs can implicitly identify whether input sequences contain useful information at early layers, prior to token generation. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Early Noise Dropping (\textsc{END}), a novel approach to mitigate this issue without requiring fine-tuning the LLMs. \textsc{END} segments input sequences into chunks and employs a linear prober on the early layers of LLMs to differentiate between informative and noisy chunks. By discarding noisy chunks early in the process, \textsc{END} preserves critical information, reduces distraction, and lowers computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textsc{END} significantly improves both performance and efficiency across different LLMs on multiple evaluation datasets. Furthermore, by investigating LLMs' implicit understanding to the input with the prober, this work also deepens understanding of how LLMs do reasoning with contexts internally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the piloting of CyberScholar, a Generative AI (GenAI) assistant tool that aims to provide feedback on writing K-12 contexts. The aim was to use GenAI to provide formative and summative feedback on students' texts in English Language Arts (ELA), Social Studies, and Modern World History. The trials discussed in this paper involved Grades 7, 8, 10, and 11 and were conducted in three schools in the Midwest and one in the Northwest of the United States. The tool used two main mechanisms: "prompt engineering" based on participant teachers' assessment rubric and "fine-tuning" a Large Language Model (LLM) from a customized corpus of teaching materials using Retrieval Augmented Generation. This paper focuses on CyberScholar's potential to enhance students' writing abilities and support teachers in diverse subject areas requiring written assignments.</description>

      <title>Towards Visual Discrimination and Reasoning of Real-World Physical Dynamics: Physics-Grounded Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03562v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans detect real-world object anomalies by perceiving, interacting, and reasoning based on object-conditioned physical knowledge. The long-term goal of Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is to enable machines to autonomously replicate this skill. However, current IAD algorithms are largely developed and tested on static, semantically simple datasets, which diverge from real-world scenarios where physical understanding and reasoning are essential. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Physics Anomaly Detection (Phys-AD) dataset, the first large-scale, real-world, physics-grounded video dataset for industrial anomaly detection. Collected using a real robot arm and motor, Phys-AD provides a diverse set of dynamic, semantically rich scenarios. The dataset includes more than 6400 videos across 22 real-world object categories, interacting with robot arms and motors, and exhibits 47 types of anomalies. Anomaly detection in Phys-AD requires visual reasoning, combining both physical knowledge and video content to determine object abnormality. We benchmark state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods under three settings: unsupervised AD, weakly-supervised AD, and video-understanding AD, highlighting their limitations in handling physics-grounded anomalies. Additionally, we introduce the Physics Anomaly Explanation (PAEval) metric, designed to assess the ability of visual-language foundation models to not only detect anomalies but also provide accurate explanations for their underlying physical causes.

      <title>Training Domain Draft Models for Speculative Decoding: Best Practices and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective method for accelerating inference of large language models (LLMs) by employing a small draft model to predict the output of a target model. However, when adapting speculative decoding to domain-specific target models, the acceptance rate of the generic draft model drops significantly due to domain shift. In this work, we systematically investigate knowledge distillation techniques for training domain draft models to improve their speculation accuracy. We compare white-box and black-box distillation approaches and explore their effectiveness in various data accessibility scenarios, including historical user queries, curated domain data, and synthetically generated alignment data. Our experiments across Function Calling, Biology, and Chinese domains show that offline distillation consistently outperforms online distillation by 11% to 25%, white-box distillation surpasses black-box distillation by 2% to 10%, and data scaling trends hold across domains. Additionally, we find that synthetic data can effectively align draft models and achieve 80% to 93% of the performance of training on historical user queries. These findings provide practical guidelines for training domain-specific draft models to improve speculative decoding efficiency.</description>

      <title>Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace: Fine-grained Face Understanding and Generation with Unified Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in foundational computer vision research, demonstrating significant potential in both image understanding and generation. However, existing research in the face domain primarily focuses on $\textbf{coarse}$ facial attribute understanding, with limited capacity to handle $\textbf{fine-grained}$ facial attributes and without addressing generation capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace, the first UMM tailored specifically for fine-grained face understanding and generation. In general, we train Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace on a self-constructed, specialized dataset utilizing two mutually beneficial diffusion techniques and a two-level mixture-of-experts architecture. Specifically, we first build a large-scale facial dataset, Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace-130K, which contains 130K image-text pairs with one million question-answering pairs that span a wide range of facial attributes. Second, we establish a theoretical connection between discrete diffusion score matching and masked generative models, optimizing both evidence lower bounds simultaneously, which significantly improves the model's ability to synthesize facial details. Finally, we introduce both token-level and sequence-level mixture-of-experts, enabling efficient fine-grained representation learning for both understanding and generation tasks. Extensive experiments on Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace-130K demonstrate that Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace outperforms existing UMMs and generative models, achieving superior performance across both understanding and generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Oasis: One Image is All You Need for Multimodal Instruction Data Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08741v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has been largely attributed to the large-scale training data. However, the training data of many MLLMs is unavailable due to privacy concerns. The expensive and labor-intensive process of collecting multi-modal data further exacerbates the problem. Is it possible to synthesize multi-modal training data automatically without compromising diversity and quality? In this paper, we propose a new method, Oasis, to synthesize high-quality multi-modal data with only images. Oasis breaks through traditional methods by prompting only images to the MLLMs, thus extending the data diversity by a large margin. Our method features a delicate quality control method which ensures the data quality. We collected over 500k data and conducted incremental experiments on LLaVA-NeXT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the performance of MLLMs. The image-based synthesis also allows us to focus on the specific-domain ability of MLLMs. Code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/Letian2003/MM_INF.</description>

      <title>Task-Specific Activation Functions for Neuroevolution using Grammatical Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Activation functions play a critical role in the performance and behaviour of neural networks, significantly impacting their ability to learn and generalise. Traditional activation functions, such as ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh, have been widely used with considerable success. However, these functions may not always provide optimal performance for all tasks and datasets. In this paper, we introduce Neuvo GEAF - an innovative approach leveraging grammatical evolution (GE) to automatically evolve novel activation functions tailored to specific neural network architectures and datasets. Experiments conducted on well-known binary classification datasets show statistically significant improvements in F1-score (between 2.4% and 9.4%) over ReLU using identical network architectures. Notably, these performance gains were achieved without increasing the network's parameter count, supporting the trend toward more efficient neural networks that can operate effectively on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper's findings suggest that evolved activation functions can provide significant performance improvements for compact networks while maintaining energy efficiency during both training and inference phases.</description>

      <title>OASST-ETC Dataset: Alignment Signals from Eye-tracking Analysis of LLM Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, aligning them with human preferences remains an open challenge. Although current alignment methods rely primarily on explicit feedback, eye-tracking (ET) data offers insights into real-time cognitive processing during reading. In this paper, we present OASST-ETC, a novel eye-tracking corpus capturing reading patterns from 24 participants, while evaluating LLM-generated responses from the OASST1 dataset. Our analysis reveals distinct reading patterns between preferred and non-preferred responses, which we compare with synthetic eye-tracking data. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human reading measures and attention patterns from various transformer-based models, discovering stronger correlations in preferred responses. This work introduces a unique resource for studying human cognitive processing in LLM evaluation and suggests promising directions for incorporating eye-tracking data into alignment methods. The dataset and analysis code are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Contextual Similarity Distillation: Ensemble Uncertainties with a Single Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is a critical aspect of reinforcement learning and deep learning, with numerous applications ranging from efficient exploration and stable offline reinforcement learning to outlier detection in medical diagnostics. The scale of modern neural networks, however, complicates the use of many theoretically well-motivated approaches such as full Bayesian inference. Approximate methods like deep ensembles can provide reliable uncertainty estimates but still remain computationally expensive. In this work, we propose contextual similarity distillation, a novel approach that explicitly estimates the variance of an ensemble of deep neural networks with a single model, without ever learning or evaluating such an ensemble in the first place. Our method builds on the predictable learning dynamics of wide neural networks, governed by the neural tangent kernel, to derive an efficient approximation of the predictive variance of an infinite ensemble. Specifically, we reinterpret the computation of ensemble variance as a supervised regression problem with kernel similarities as regression targets. The resulting model can estimate predictive variance at inference time with a single forward pass, and can make use of unlabeled target-domain data or data augmentations to refine its uncertainty estimates. We empirically validate our method across a variety of out-of-distribution detection benchmarks and sparse-reward reinforcement learning environments. We find that our single-model method performs competitively and sometimes superior to ensemble-based baselines and serves as a reliable signal for efficient exploration. These results, we believe, position contextual similarity distillation as a principled and scalable alternative for uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning and general deep learning.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Foundation Model for Multi-modal and Hyperspectral Geospatial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geospatial raster data, such as that collected by satellite-based imaging systems at different times and spectral bands, hold immense potential for enabling a wide range of high-impact applications. This potential stems from the rich information that is spatially and temporally contextualized across multiple channels and sensing modalities. Recent work has adapted existing self-supervised learning approaches for such geospatial data. However, they fall short of scalable model architectures, leading to inflexibility and computational inefficiencies when faced with an increasing number of channels and modalities. To address these limitations, we introduce Low-rank Efficient Spatial-Spectral Vision Transformer with three key innovations: i) the LESS Attention Block that approximates high-dimensional spatial-spectral attention through Kronecker's product of the low-dimensional spatial and spectral attention components; ii) the Continuous Positional-Channel Embedding Layer that preserves both the continuity and physical characteristics of each spatial-spectral patch; and iii) the Perception Field Mask that exploits local spatial dependencies by constraining attention to neighboring patches. To evaluate the proposed innovations, we construct GFM-Bench, which serves as a comprehensive benchmark for such geospatial raster data. We pretrain LESS ViT using a Hyperspectral Masked Autoencoder framework with integrated positional and channel masking strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art multi-modal geospatial foundation models while outperforming them on cross-satellite generalization tasks with higher computational efficiency. The flexibility and extensibility of our framework make it a promising direction for future geospatial data analysis tasks that involve a wide range of modalities and channels.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Modeling of Zero-Shot Classifications for Urban Flood Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Street scene datasets, collected from Street View or dashboard cameras, offer a promising means of detecting urban objects and incidents like street flooding. However, a major challenge in using these datasets is their lack of reliable labels: there are myriad types of incidents, many types occur rarely, and ground-truth measures of where incidents occur are lacking. Here, we propose BayFlood, a two-stage approach which circumvents this difficulty. First, we perform zero-shot classification of where incidents occur using a pretrained vision-language model (VLM). Second, we fit a spatial Bayesian model on the VLM classifications. The zero-shot approach avoids the need to annotate large training sets, and the Bayesian model provides frequent desiderata in urban settings - principled measures of uncertainty, smoothing across locations, and incorporation of external data like stormwater accumulation zones. We comprehensively validate this two-stage approach, showing that VLMs provide strong zero-shot signal for floods across multiple cities and time periods, the Bayesian model improves out-of-sample prediction relative to baseline methods, and our inferred flood risk correlates with known external predictors of risk. Having validated our approach, we show it can be used to improve urban flood detection: our analysis reveals 113,738 people who are at high risk of flooding overlooked by current methods, identifies demographic biases in existing methods, and suggests locations for new flood sensors. More broadly, our results showcase how Bayesian modeling of zero-shot LM annotations represents a promising paradigm because it avoids the need to collect large labeled datasets and leverages the power of foundation models while providing the expressiveness and uncertainty quantification of Bayesian models.</description>

      <title>Unleashing Vecset Diffusion Model for Fast Shape Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D shape generation has greatly flourished through the development of so-called "native" 3D diffusion, particularly through the Vecset Diffusion Model (VDM). While recent advancements have shown promising results in generating high-resolution 3D shapes, VDM still struggles with high-speed generation. Challenges exist because of difficulties not only in accelerating diffusion sampling but also VAE decoding in VDM, areas under-explored in previous works. To address these challenges, we present FlashVDM, a systematic framework for accelerating both VAE and DiT in VDM. For DiT, FlashVDM enables flexible diffusion sampling with as few as 5 inference steps and comparable quality, which is made possible by stabilizing consistency distillation with our newly introduced Progressive Flow Distillation. For VAE, we introduce a lightning vecset decoder equipped with Adaptive KV Selection, Hierarchical Volume Decoding, and Efficient Network Design. By exploiting the locality of the vecset and the sparsity of shape surface in the volume, our decoder drastically lowers FLOPs, minimizing the overall decoding overhead. We apply FlashVDM to Hunyuan3D-2 to obtain Hunyuan3D-2 Turbo. Through systematic evaluation, we show that our model significantly outperforms existing fast 3D generation methods, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art while reducing inference time by over 45x for reconstruction and 32x for generation.

      <title>ARFlow: Human Action-Reaction Flow Matching with Physical Guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human action-reaction synthesis, a fundamental challenge in modeling causal human interactions, plays a critical role in applications ranging from virtual reality to social robotics. While diffusion-based models have demonstrated promising performance, they exhibit two key limitations for interaction synthesis: reliance on complex noise-to-reaction generators with intricate conditional mechanisms, and frequent physical violations in generated motions. To address these issues, we propose Action-Reaction Flow Matching (ARFlow), a novel framework that establishes direct action-to-reaction mappings, eliminating the need for complex conditional mechanisms. Our approach introduces two key innovations: an x1-prediction method that directly outputs human motions instead of velocity fields, enabling explicit constraint enforcement; and a training-free, gradient-based physical guidance mechanism that effectively prevents body penetration artifacts during sampling. Extensive experiments on NTU120 and Chi3D datasets demonstrate that ARFlow not only outperforms existing methods in terms of Fr\'echet Inception Distance and motion diversity but also significantly reduces body collisions, as measured by our new Intersection Volume and Intersection Frequency metrics.</description>

      <title>Assessing Consistency and Reproducibility in the Outputs of Large Language Models: Evidence Across Diverse Finance and Accounting Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of consistency and reproducibility in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in finance and accounting research. We evaluate how consistently LLMs produce outputs given identical inputs through extensive experimentation with 50 independent runs across five common tasks: classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, text generation, and prediction. Using three OpenAI models (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o), we generate over 3.4 million outputs from diverse financial source texts and data, covering MD&amp;As, FOMC statements, finance news articles, earnings call transcripts, and financial statements. Our findings reveal substantial but task-dependent consistency, with binary classification and sentiment analysis achieving near-perfect reproducibility, while complex tasks show greater variability. More advanced models do not consistently demonstrate better consistency and reproducibility, with task-specific patterns emerging. LLMs significantly outperform expert human annotators in consistency and maintain high agreement even where human experts significantly disagree. We further find that simple aggregation strategies across 3-5 runs dramatically improve consistency. We also find that aggregation may come with an additional benefit of improved accuracy for sentiment analysis when using newer models. Simulation analysis reveals that despite measurable inconsistency in LLM outputs, downstream statistical inferences remain remarkably robust. These findings address concerns about what we term "G-hacking," the selective reporting of favorable outcomes from multiple Generative AI runs, by demonstrating that such risks are relatively low for finance and accounting tasks.</description>

      <title>LaMOuR: Leveraging Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Recovery in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has demonstrated strong performance in robotic control but remains susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) states, often resulting in unreliable actions and task failure. While previous methods have focused on minimizing or preventing OOD occurrences, they largely neglect recovery once an agent encounters such states. Although the latest research has attempted to address this by guiding agents back to in-distribution states, their reliance on uncertainty estimation hinders scalability in complex environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Recovery (LaMOuR), which enables recovery learning without relying on uncertainty estimation. LaMOuR generates dense reward codes that guide the agent back to a state where it can successfully perform its original task, leveraging the capabilities of LVLMs in image description, logical reasoning, and code generation. Experimental results show that LaMOuR substantially enhances recovery efficiency across diverse locomotion tasks and even generalizes effectively to complex environments, including humanoid locomotion and mobile manipulation, where existing methods struggle.

      <title>PG-SAM: Prior-Guided SAM with Medical for Multi-organ Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates powerful zero-shot capabilities; however, its accuracy and robustness significantly decrease when applied to medical image segmentation. Existing methods address this issue through modality fusion, integrating textual and image information to provide more detailed priors. In this study, we argue that the granularity of text and the domain gap affect the accuracy of the priors. Furthermore, the discrepancy between high-level abstract semantics and pixel-level boundary details in images can introduce noise into the fusion process. To address this, we propose Prior-Guided SAM (PG-SAM), which employs a fine-grained modality prior aligner to leverage specialized medical knowledge for better modality alignment. The core of our method lies in efficiently addressing the domain gap with fine-grained text from a medical LLM. Meanwhile, it also enhances the priors' quality after modality alignment, ensuring more accurate segmentation. In addition, our decoder enhances the model's expressive capabilities through multi-level feature fusion and iterative mask optimizer operations, supporting unprompted learning. We also propose a unified pipeline that effectively supplies high-quality semantic information to SAM. Extensive experiments on the Synapse dataset demonstrate that the proposed PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code is released at https://github.com/logan-0623/PG-SAM.</description>

      <title>PRECTR: A Synergistic Framework for Integrating Personalized Search Relevance Matching and CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two primary tasks in the search recommendation system are search relevance matching and click-through rate (CTR) prediction -- the former focuses on seeking relevant items for user queries whereas the latter forecasts which item may better match user interest. Prior research typically develops two models to predict the CTR and search relevance separately, then ranking candidate items based on the fusion of the two outputs. However, such a divide-and-conquer paradigm creates the inconsistency between different models. Meanwhile, the search relevance model mainly concentrates on the degree of objective text matching while neglecting personalized differences among different users, leading to restricted model performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a unified Personalized Search RElevance Matching and CTR Prediction Fusion Model(PRECTR). Specifically, based on the conditional probability fusion mechanism, PRECTR integrates the CTR prediction and search relevance matching into one framework to enhance the interaction and consistency of the two modules. However, directly optimizing CTR binary classification loss may bring challenges to the fusion model's convergence and indefinitely promote the exposure of items with high CTR, regardless of their search relevance. Hence, we further introduce two-stage training and semantic consistency regularization to accelerate the model's convergence and restrain the recommendation of irrelevant items. Finally, acknowledging that different users may have varied relevance preferences, we assessed current users' relevance preferences by analyzing past users' preferences for similar queries and tailored incentives for different candidate items accordingly. Extensive experimental results on our production dataset and online A/B testing demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed PRECTR method.</description>

      <title>Three Kinds of AI Ethics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is an overwhelming abundance of works in AI Ethics. This growth is chaotic because of how sudden it is, its volume, and its multidisciplinary nature. This makes difficult to keep track of debates, and to systematically characterize goals, research questions, methods, and expertise required by AI ethicists. In this article, I show that the relation between AI and ethics can be characterized in at least three ways, which correspond to three well-represented kinds of AI ethics: ethics and AI; ethics in AI; ethics of AI. I elucidate the features of these three kinds of AI Ethics, characterize their research questions, and identify the kind of expertise that each kind needs. I also show how certain criticisms to AI ethics are misplaced, as being done from the point of view of one kind of AI ethics, to another kind with different goals. All in all, this work sheds light on the nature of AI ethics, and sets the groundwork for more informed discussions about the scope, methods, and training of AI ethicists.</description>

      <title>Threshold Crossings as Tail Events for Catastrophic AI Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse circumstances in which bifurcation-driven jumps in AI systems are associated with emergent heavy-tailed outcome distributions. By analysing how a control parameter's random fluctuations near a catastrophic threshold generate extreme outcomes, we demonstrate in what circumstances the probability of a sudden, large-scale, transition aligns closely with the tail probability of the resulting damage distribution. Our results contribute to research in monitoring, mitigation and control of AI systems when seeking to manage potentially catastrophic AI risk.</description>

      <title>Graph-Level Label-Only Membership Inference Attack against Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for graph-structured data but are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs) in graph classification tasks, which determine if a graph was part of the training dataset, potentially causing data leakage. Existing MIAs rely on prediction probability vectors, but they become ineffective when only prediction labels are available. We propose a Graph-level Label-Only Membership Inference Attack (GLO-MIA), which is based on the intuition that the target model's predictions on training data are more stable than those on testing data. GLO-MIA generates a set of perturbed graphs for target graph by adding perturbations to its effective features and queries the target model with the perturbed graphs to get their prediction labels, which are then used to calculate robustness score of the target graph. Finally, by comparing the robustness score with a predefined threshold, the membership of the target graph can be inferred correctly with high probability. Our evaluation on three datasets and four GNN models shows that GLO-MIA achieves an attack accuracy of up to 0.825, outperforming baseline work by 8.5% and closely matching the performance of probability-based MIAs, even with only prediction labels.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws of Synthetic Data for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks, largely driven by high-quality web data used in pre-training. However, recent studies indicate this data source is rapidly depleting. Synthetic data emerges as a promising alternative, but it remains unclear whether synthetic datasets exhibit predictable scalability comparable to raw pre-training data. In this work, we systematically investigate the scaling laws of synthetic data by introducing SynthLLM, a scalable framework that transforms pre-training corpora into diverse, high-quality synthetic datasets. Our approach achieves this by automatically extracting and recombining high-level concepts across multiple documents using a graph algorithm. Key findings from our extensive mathematical experiments on SynthLLM include: (1) SynthLLM generates synthetic data that reliably adheres to the rectified scaling law across various model sizes; (2) Performance improvements plateau near 300B tokens; and (3) Larger models approach optimal performance with fewer training tokens. For instance, an 8B model peaks at 1T tokens, while a 3B model requires 4T. Moreover, comparisons with existing synthetic data generation and augmentation methods demonstrate that SynthLLM achieves superior performance and scalability. Our findings highlight synthetic data as a scalable and reliable alternative to organic pre-training corpora, offering a viable path toward continued improvement in model performance.</description>

      <title>CamSAM2: Segment Anything Accurately in Camouflaged Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video camouflaged object segmentation (VCOS), aiming at segmenting camouflaged objects that seamlessly blend into their environment, is a fundamental vision task with various real-world applications. With the release of SAM2, video segmentation has witnessed significant progress. However, SAM2's capability of segmenting camouflaged videos is suboptimal, especially when given simple prompts such as point and box. To address the problem, we propose Camouflaged SAM2 (CamSAM2), which enhances SAM2's ability to handle camouflaged scenes without modifying SAM2's parameters. Specifically, we introduce a decamouflaged token to provide the flexibility of feature adjustment for VCOS. To make full use of fine-grained and high-resolution features from the current frame and previous frames, we propose implicit object-aware fusion (IOF) and explicit object-aware fusion (EOF) modules, respectively. Object prototype generation (OPG) is introduced to abstract and memorize object prototypes with informative details using high-quality features from previous frames. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our approach. While CamSAM2 only adds negligible learnable parameters to SAM2, it substantially outperforms SAM2 on three VCOS datasets, especially achieving 12.2 mDice gains with click prompt on MoCA-Mask and 19.6 mDice gains with mask prompt on SUN-SEG-Hard, with Hiera-T as the backbone. The code will be available at https://github.com/zhoustan/CamSAM2.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event cameras have gained increasing attention for 3D reconstruction due to their high temporal resolution, low latency, and high dynamic range. They capture per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously, allowing accurate reconstruction under fast motion and challenging lighting conditions. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of event-driven 3D reconstruction methods, including stereo, monocular, and multimodal systems. We further categorize recent developments based on geometric, learning-based, and hybrid approaches. Emerging trends, such as neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian splatting with event data, are also covered. The related works are structured chronologically to illustrate the innovations and progression within the field. To support future research, we also highlight key research gaps and future research directions in dataset, experiment, evaluation, event representation, etc.</description>
