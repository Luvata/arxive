      <title>DiMo-GUI: Advancing Test-time Scaling in GUI Grounding via Modality-Aware Visual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) poses unique challenges due to the diversity of visual elements, spatial clutter, and the ambiguity of language. In this paper, we introduce DiMo-GUI, a training-free framework for GUI grounding that leverages two core strategies: dynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization. Instead of treating the GUI as a monolithic image, our method splits the input into textual elements and iconic elements, allowing the model to reason over each modality independently using general-purpose vision-language models. When predictions are ambiguous or incorrect, DiMo-GUI dynamically focuses attention by generating candidate focal regions centered on the model's initial predictions and incrementally zooms into subregions to refine the grounding result. This hierarchical refinement process helps disambiguate visually crowded layouts without the need for additional training or annotations. We evaluate our approach on standard GUI grounding benchmarks and demonstrate consistent improvements over baseline inference pipelines, highlighting the effectiveness of combining modality separation with region-focused reasoning.</description>

      <title>TalentMine: LLM-Based Extraction and Question-Answering from Multimodal Talent Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In talent management systems, critical information often resides in complex tabular formats, presenting significant retrieval challenges for conventional language models. These challenges are pronounced when processing Talent documentation that requires precise interpretation of tabular relationships for accurate information retrieval and downstream decision-making. Current table extraction methods struggle with semantic understanding, resulting in poor performance when integrated into retrieval-augmented chat applications. This paper identifies a key bottleneck - while structural table information can be extracted, the semantic relationships between tabular elements are lost, causing downstream query failures. To address this, we introduce TalentMine, a novel LLM-enhanced framework that transforms extracted tables into semantically enriched representations. Unlike conventional approaches relying on CSV or text linearization, our method employs specialized multimodal reasoning to preserve both structural and semantic dimensions of tabular data. Experimental evaluation across employee benefits document collections demonstrates TalentMine's superior performance, achieving 100% accuracy in query answering tasks compared to 0% for standard AWS Textract extraction and 40% for AWS Textract Visual Q&amp;A capabilities. Our comparative analysis also reveals that the Claude v3 Haiku model achieves optimal performance for talent management applications. The key contributions of this work include (1) a systematic analysis of semantic information loss in current table extraction pipelines, (2) a novel LLM-based method for semantically enriched table representation, (3) an efficient integration framework for retrieval-augmented systems as end-to-end systems, and (4) comprehensive benchmarks on talent analytics tasks showing substantial improvements across multiple categories.</description>

      <title>A collaborative digital twin built on FAIR data and compute infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of machine learning with automated experimentation in self-driving laboratories (SDL) offers a powerful approach to accelerate discovery and optimization tasks in science and engineering applications. When supported by findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data infrastructure, SDLs with overlapping interests can collaborate more effectively. This work presents a distributed SDL implementation built on nanoHUB services for online simulation and FAIR data management. In this framework, geographically dispersed collaborators conducting independent optimization tasks contribute raw experimental data to a shared central database. These researchers can then benefit from analysis tools and machine learning models that automatically update as additional data become available. New data points are submitted through a simple web interface and automatically processed using a nanoHUB Sim2L, which extracts derived quantities and indexes all inputs and outputs in a FAIR data repository called ResultsDB. A separate nanoHUB workflow enables sequential optimization using active learning, where researchers define the optimization objective, and machine learning models are trained on-the-fly with all existing data, guiding the selection of future experiments. Inspired by the concept of ``frugal twin", the optimization task seeks to find the optimal recipe to combine food dyes to achieve the desired target color. With easily accessible and inexpensive materials, researchers and students can set up their own experiments, share data with collaborators, and explore the combination of FAIR data, predictive ML models, and sequential optimization. The tools introduced are generally applicable and can easily be extended to other optimization problems.</description>

      <title>SEZ-HARN: Self-Explainable Zero-shot Human Activity Recognition Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR), which uses data from Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, has many practical applications in healthcare and assisted living environments. However, its use in real-world scenarios has been limited by the lack of comprehensive IMU-based HAR datasets that cover a wide range of activities and the lack of transparency in existing HAR models. Zero-shot HAR (ZS-HAR) overcomes the data limitations, but current models struggle to explain their decisions, making them less transparent. This paper introduces a novel IMU-based ZS-HAR model called the Self-Explainable Zero-shot Human Activity Recognition Network (SEZ-HARN). It can recognize activities not encountered during training and provide skeleton videos to explain its decision-making process. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SEZ-HARN on four benchmark datasets PAMAP2, DaLiAc, HTD-MHAD and MHealth and compare its performance against three state-of-the-art black-box ZS-HAR models. The experiment results demonstrate that SEZ-HARN produces realistic and understandable explanations while achieving competitive Zero-shot recognition accuracy. SEZ-HARN achieves a Zero-shot prediction accuracy within 3\% of the best-performing black-box model on PAMAP2 while maintaining comparable performance on the other three datasets.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities in SLMs with Reward Guided Dataset Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The push to compress and impart the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) into more deployable and efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) has benefited from improvements in knowledge distillation (KD) techniques. These techniques allow a smaller student model to learn from a more capable and larger teacher model's responses. However, distillation often revolves around the student model merely copying the teacher's in-distribution responses, limiting its generalisability. This limitation is amplified on reasoning tasks and can be computationally expensive. In this study, we propose AdvDistill, a reward-guided dataset distillation framework. We utilise multiple generations (responses) from a teacher for each prompt and assign rewards based on rule-based verifiers. These varying and normally distributed rewards serve as weights when training student models. Our methods and their subsequent behavioural analysis demonstrate a significant improvement in student model performance for mathematical and complex reasoning tasks, showcasing the efficacy and benefits of incorporating a rewarding mechanism in dataset distillation processes.</description>

      <title>VoyagerVision: Investigating the Role of Multi-modal Information for Open-ended Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-endedness is an active field of research in the pursuit of capable Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), allowing models to pursue tasks of their own choosing. Simultaneously, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o [9] have allowed such models to be capable of interpreting image inputs. Implementations such as OMNI-EPIC [4] have made use of such features, providing an LLM with pixel data of an agent's POV to parse the environment and allow it to solve tasks. This paper proposes that providing these visual inputs to a model gives it greater ability to interpret spatial environments, and as such, can increase the number of tasks it can successfully perform, extending its open-ended potential. To this aim, this paper proposes VoyagerVision -- a multi-modal model capable of creating structures within Minecraft using screenshots as a form of visual feedback, building on the foundation of Voyager. VoyagerVision was capable of creating an average of 2.75 unique structures within fifty iterations of the system, as Voyager was incapable of this, it is an extension in an entirely new direction. Additionally, in a set of building unit tests VoyagerVision was successful in half of all attempts in flat worlds, with most failures arising in more complex structures.

      <title>Thinking About Thinking: SAGE-nano's Inverse Reasoning for Self-Aware Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities at solving complex reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but their decision-making processes remain somewhat blackbox. We introduce textbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to decompose and explain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a 4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that reflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and generate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are directed towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides insight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Through thorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethical dilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, we demonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy (74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) for its task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o. Our contributions are: (i) the first rigorous framework for LLM self-reflection via inverse reasoning, (ii) a novel metalearning framework to reverse the attention flow, (iii) comprehensive evaluation frameworks for reasoning transparency, and (iv) evidence that increasing reasoning using inverse reasoning improves interpretability along with reasoning performance. Our work creates new avenues for transparent AI systems and closes significant gaps in AI safety, education, and scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>BlackBoxToBlueprint: Extracting Interpretable Logic from Legacy Systems using Reinforcement Learning and Counterfactual Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modernizing legacy software systems is a critical but challenging task, often hampered by a lack of documentation and understanding of the original system's intricate decision logic. Traditional approaches like behavioral cloning merely replicate input-output behavior without capturing the underlying intent. This paper proposes a novel pipeline to automatically extract interpretable decision logic from legacy systems treated as black boxes. The approach uses a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to explore the input space and identify critical decision boundaries by rewarding actions that cause meaningful changes in the system's output. These counterfactual state transitions, where the output changes, are collected and clustered using K-Means. Decision trees are then trained on these clusters to extract human-readable rules that approximate the system's decision logic near the identified boundaries. I demonstrated the pipeline's effectiveness on three dummy legacy systems with varying complexity, including threshold-based, combined-conditional, and non-linear range logic. Results show that the RL agent successfully focuses exploration on relevant boundary regions, and the extracted rules accurately reflect the core logic of the underlying dummy systems, providing a promising foundation for generating specifications and test cases during legacy migration.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT produces more "lazy" thinkers: Evidence of cognitive engagement decline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in education, concerns have emerged about their potential to reduce deep thinking and active learning. This study investigates the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, specifically ChatGPT, on the cognitive engagement of students during academic writing tasks. The study employed an experimental design with participants randomly assigned to either an AI-assisted (ChatGPT) or a non-assisted (control) condition. Participants completed a structured argumentative writing task followed by a cognitive engagement scale (CES), the CES-AI, developed to assess mental effort, attention, deep processing, and strategic thinking. The results revealed significantly lower cognitive engagement scores in the ChatGPT group compared to the control group. These findings suggest that AI assistance may lead to cognitive offloading. The study contributes to the growing body of literature on the psychological implications of AI in education and raises important questions about the integration of such tools into academic practice. It calls for pedagogical strategies that promote active, reflective engagement with AI-generated content to avoid compromising self-regulated learning and deep cognitive involvement of students.</description>

      <title>Holistic Artificial Intelligence in Medicine; improved performance and explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing interest in deploying Artificial Intelligence in medicine, we previously introduced HAIM (Holistic AI in Medicine), a framework that fuses multimodal data to solve downstream clinical tasks. However, HAIM uses data in a task-agnostic manner and lacks explainability. To address these limitations, we introduce xHAIM (Explainable HAIM), a novel framework leveraging Generative AI to enhance both prediction and explainability through four structured steps: (1) automatically identifying task-relevant patient data across modalities, (2) generating comprehensive patient summaries, (3) using these summaries for improved predictive modeling, and (4) providing clinical explanations by linking predictions to patient-specific medical knowledge. Evaluated on the HAIM-MIMIC-MM dataset, xHAIM improves average AUC from 79.9% to 90.3% across chest pathology and operative tasks. Importantly, xHAIM transforms AI from a black-box predictor into an explainable decision support system, enabling clinicians to interactively trace predictions back to relevant patient data, bridging AI advancements with clinical utility.</description>

      <title>Learning for routing: A guided review of recent developments and future directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reviews the current progress in applying machine learning (ML) tools to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, with a focus on routing problems such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the vehicle routing problem (VRP). Due to the inherent complexity of these problems, exact algorithms often require excessive computational time to find optimal solutions, while heuristics can only provide approximate solutions without guaranteeing optimality. With the recent success of machine learning models, there is a growing trend in proposing and implementing diverse ML techniques to enhance the resolution of these challenging routing problems. We propose a taxonomy categorizing ML-based routing methods into construction-based and improvement-based approaches, highlighting their applicability to various problem characteristics. This review aims to integrate traditional OR methods with state-of-the-art ML techniques, providing a structured framework to guide future research and address emerging VRP variants.</description>

      <title>ASTRO: Teaching Language Models to Reason by Reflecting and Backtracking In-Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ASTRO, the "Autoregressive Search-Taught Reasoner", a framework for training language models to reason like search algorithms, explicitly leveraging self-reflection, backtracking, and exploration in their outputs. Recently, training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) has led to the advent of reasoning models with greatly enhanced reasoning capabilities. Open-source replications of reasoning models, while successful, build upon models that already exhibit strong reasoning capabilities along with search behavior observed even before RL. As a result, it is yet unclear how to boost the reasoning capabilities of other non-reasoner models including Llama 3. ASTRO teaches such models to internalize structured search behavior through a synthetic dataset derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) over mathematical problem-solving trajectories. By converting search traces into natural language chain-of-thoughts that capture both successes and recoveries from failure, ASTRO bootstraps models with a rich prior for exploration during RL. We finetune our models on these search-derived traces and further improve performance via RL with verifiable rewards. We apply ASTRO to the Llama 3 family of models and achieve absolute performance gains of 16.0% on MATH-500, 26.9% on AMC 2023, and 20.0% on AIME 2024, especially improving upon challenging problems that require iterative correction. Our results demonstrate that search-inspired training offers a principled way to instill robust reasoning capabilities into open LLMs.</description>

      <title>Does Math Reasoning Improve General LLM Capabilities? Understanding Transferability of LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week, it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20 open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for advancing reasoning models.</description>

      <title>Advancing Local Search in SMT-NRA with MCSAT Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we advance local search for Satisfiability Modulo the Theory of Nonlinear Real Arithmetic (SMT-NRA for short). First, we introduce a two-dimensional cell-jump move, called \emph{$2d$-cell-jump}, generalizing the key operation, cell-jump, of the local search method for SMT-NRA. Then, we propose an extended local search framework, named \emph{$2d$-LS} (following the local search framework, LS, for SMT-NRA), integrating the model constructing satisfiability calculus (MCSAT) framework to improve search efficiency. To further improve the efficiency of MCSAT, we implement a recently proposed technique called \emph{sample-cell projection operator} for MCSAT, which is well suited for CDCL-style search in the real domain and helps guide the search away from conflicting states. Finally, we design a hybrid framework for SMT-NRA combining MCSAT, $2d$-LS and OpenCAD, to improve search efficiency through information exchange. The experimental results demonstrate improvements in local search performance, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Develop Strategic Reasoning? Post-training Insights from Learning Chess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00726v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in mathematical reasoning, strategic reasoning for LLMs using RL remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs can develop strategic reasoning capabilities through RL in chess. To this end, we leverage a chess-pretrained action-value network to provide dense reward on the LLM's output move quality, which can be seen as a form of knowledge distillation. Our experiments show that our distillation-based dense rewards often outperform sparse binary rewards. However, surprisingly, all models plateau far below expert levels. We provide SFT and RL ablations on chess reasoning training and find evidence that this limitation stems from a deficit in the pretrained models' internal understanding of chess--a deficit which RL alone may not be able to fully overcome.</description>

      <title>SafeMobile: Chain-level Jailbreak Detection and Automated Evaluation for Multimodal Mobile Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the wide application of multimodal foundation models in intelligent agent systems, scenarios such as mobile device control, intelligent assistant interaction, and multimodal task execution are gradually relying on such large model-driven agents. However, the related systems are also increasingly exposed to potential jailbreak risks. Attackers may induce the agents to bypass the original behavioral constraints through specific inputs, and then trigger certain risky and sensitive operations, such as modifying settings, executing unauthorized commands, or impersonating user identities, which brings new challenges to system security. Existing security measures for intelligent agents still have limitations when facing complex interactions, especially in detecting potentially risky behaviors across multiple rounds of conversations or sequences of tasks. In addition, an efficient and consistent automated methodology to assist in assessing and determining the impact of such risks is currently lacking. This work explores the security issues surrounding mobile multimodal agents, attempts to construct a risk discrimination mechanism by incorporating behavioral sequence information, and designs an automated assisted assessment scheme based on a large language model. Through preliminary validation in several representative high-risk tasks, the results show that the method can improve the recognition of risky behaviors to some extent and assist in reducing the probability of agents being jailbroken. We hope that this study can provide some valuable references for the security risk modeling and protection of multimodal intelligent agent systems.</description>

      <title>Thinking Beyond Tokens: From Brain-Inspired Intelligence to Cognitive Foundations for Artificial General Intelligence and its Societal Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can machines truly think, reason and act in domains like humans? This enduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5, DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal fluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency. This paper offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, spanning artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models, and agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations of general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent memory, and multi-agent coordination. In particular, we emphasize the rise of Agentic RAG frameworks that combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use to enable more adaptive behavior. We discuss generalization strategies, including information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free methods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task completion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone but from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular, interactive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive behavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning, and cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we identify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LLM Agent Safety via Causal Influence Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) continue to demonstrate potential across various assistive tasks, ensuring their safe and reliable behavior is crucial for preventing unintended consequences. In this work, we introduce CIP, a novel technique that leverages causal influence diagrams (CIDs) to identify and mitigate risks arising from agent decision-making. CIDs provide a structured representation of cause-and-effect relationships, enabling agents to anticipate harmful outcomes and make safer decisions. Our approach consists of three key steps: (1) initializing a CID based on task specifications to outline the decision-making process, (2) guiding agent interactions with the environment using the CID, and (3) iteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances safety in both code execution and mobile device control tasks.</description>

      <title>Hypertokens: Holographic Associative Memory in Tokenized LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but suffer from apparent precision loss, reframed here as information spreading. This reframing shifts the problem from computational precision to an information-theoretic communication issue. We address the K:V and V:K memory problem in LLMs by introducing HDRAM (Holographically Defined Random Access Memory), a symbolic memory framework treating transformer latent space as a spread-spectrum channel. Built upon hypertokens, structured symbolic codes integrating classical error-correcting codes (ECC), holographic computing, and quantum-inspired search, HDRAM recovers distributed information through principled despreading. These phase-coherent memory addresses enable efficient key-value operations and Grover-style search in latent space. By combining ECC grammar with compressed sensing and Krylov subspace alignment, HDRAM significantly improves associative retrieval without architectural changes, demonstrating how Classical-Holographic-Quantum-inspired (CHQ) principles can fortify transformer architectures.</description>

      <title>Deciding When Not to Decide: Indeterminacy-Aware Intrusion Detection with NeutroSENSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents NeutroSENSE, a neutrosophic-enhanced ensemble framework for interpretable intrusion detection in IoT environments. By integrating Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression with neutrosophic logic, the system decomposes prediction confidence into truth (T), falsity (F), and indeterminacy (I) components, enabling uncertainty quantification and abstention. Predictions with high indeterminacy are flagged for review using both global and adaptive, class-specific thresholds. Evaluated on the IoT-CAD dataset, NeutroSENSE achieved 97% accuracy, while demonstrating that misclassified samples exhibit significantly higher indeterminacy (I = 0.62) than correct ones (I = 0.24). The use of indeterminacy as a proxy for uncertainty enables informed abstention and targeted review-particularly valuable in edge deployments. Figures and tables validate the correlation between I-scores and error likelihood, supporting more trustworthy, human-in-the-loop AI decisions. This work shows that neutrosophic logic enhances both accuracy and explainability, providing a practical foundation for trust-aware AI in edge and fog-based IoT security systems.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Inference Compute Scaling: Reasoning through Directed Stochastic Skill Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand considerable computational, energy, and financial resources during both training and deployment. While scaling laws for training have guided much of the field's recent progress, inference costs now represent a significant and growing component of the overall resource burden, particularly for reasoning-focused models. Existing characterizations of compute-optimality that consider model size, dataset size, and inference tokens in isolation or in fixed combinations risk overlooking more efficient operating points. We introduce directed stochastic skill search (DS3), a general framework that represents inference as stochastic traversal over a learned skill graph. From a simplified yet expressive instantiation, we derive closed-form expressions for task success and compute cost across a wide range of inference strategies -- including chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thought (ToT) -- enabling comparative analysis as a function of task difficulty and model capability. To that end, we extend a prior first-principles tripartite graph framework of LLM training to incorporate inference, and separately bridge DS3 with empirical methods that characterize LLM scaling behavior. We theoretically recover empirically observed patterns, including: linear accuracy scaling with logarithmic compute; variation in preferred inference strategies as a function of task difficulty and model capability; emergent behavior elicited by reasoning even when performance plateaus under parameter scaling; and both best-of-N (BoN) and majority voting behavior captured within a unified analytical framework. By explicitly characterizing training-inference interdependencies, our framework deepens theoretical understanding and supports principled algorithmic design and resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Integrating Universal Generative AI Platforms in Educational Labs to Foster Critical Thinking and Digital Literacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new educational framework for integrating generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) platforms such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini into laboratory activities aimed at developing critical thinking and digital literacy among undergraduate students. Recognizing the limitations and risks of uncritical reliance on large language models (LLMs), the proposed pedagogical model reframes GenAI as a research subject and cognitive tool. Students formulate discipline-specific prompts and evaluate GenAI-generated responses in text, image, and video modalities. A pilot implementation in a general astronomy course for non-science majors demonstrated high levels of engagement and critical reflection, with many students continuing the activity after class and presenting results at a research symposium. The results highlight the importance of structured AI interactions in education and suggest that GenAI can improve learning outcomes when combined with reflective assessment methods. The study proposes a replicable model for interdisciplinary AI-integrated lab work, adaptable to scientific disciplines.

      <title>Novel RL approach for efficient Elevator Group Control Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient elevator traffic management in large buildings is critical for minimizing passenger travel times and energy consumption. Because heuristic- or pattern-detection-based controllers struggle with the stochastic and combinatorial nature of dispatching, we model the six-elevator, fifteen-floor system at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as a Markov Decision Process and train an end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL) Elevator Group Control System (EGCS). Key innovations include a novel action space encoding to handle the combinatorial complexity of elevator dispatching, the introduction of infra-steps to model continuous passenger arrivals, and a tailored reward signal to improve learning efficiency. In addition, we explore various ways to adapt the discounting factor to the infra-step formulation. We investigate RL architectures based on Dueling Double Deep Q-learning, showing that the proposed RL-based EGCS adapts to fluctuating traffic patterns, learns from a highly stochastic environment, and thereby outperforms a traditional rule-based algorithm.</description>

      <title>Towards Undistillable Models by Minimizing Conditional Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deep neural network (DNN) is said to be undistillable if, when used as a black-box input-output teacher, it cannot be distilled through knowledge distillation (KD). In this case, the distilled student (referred to as the knockoff student) does not outperform a student trained independently with label smoothing (LS student) in terms of prediction accuracy. To protect intellectual property of DNNs, it is desirable to build undistillable DNNs. To this end, it is first observed that an undistillable DNN may have the trait that each cluster of its output probability distributions in response to all sample instances with the same label should be highly concentrated to the extent that each cluster corresponding to each label should ideally collapse into one probability distribution. Based on this observation and by measuring the concentration of each cluster in terms of conditional mutual information (CMI), a new training method called CMI minimized (CMIM) method is proposed, which trains a DNN by jointly minimizing the conventional cross entropy (CE) loss and the CMI values of all temperature scaled clusters across the entire temperature spectrum. The resulting CMIM model is shown, by extensive experiments, to be undistillable by all tested KD methods existing in the literature. That is, the knockoff students distilled by these KD methods from the CMIM model underperform the respective LS students. In addition, the CMIM model is also shown to performs better than the model trained with the CE loss alone in terms of their own prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>ST-MTM: Masked Time Series Modeling with Seasonal-Trend Decomposition for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting complex time series is an important yet challenging problem that involves various industrial applications. Recently, masked time-series modeling has been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by reconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic information in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations generated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series ignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious temporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal semantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled patterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a masked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which includes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that incorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a period masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked seasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking strategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar variations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task for learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies. Additionally, ST-MTM introduces a contrastive learning task to support masked modeling by enhancing contextual consistency among multiple masked seasonal representations. Experimental results show that our proposed ST-MTM achieves consistently superior forecasting performance compared to existing masked modeling, contrastive learning, and supervised forecasting methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results on static code-generation benchmarks, but real-world software development unfolds as a continuous stream of evolving issues, fixes, and feature requests. We introduce SWE-Bench-CL, a novel continual learning benchmark built on the human-verified SWE-Bench Verified dataset introduced by OpenAI and Princeton-NLP in 2024. By organizing GitHub issues into chronologically ordered sequences that reflect natural repository evolution, SWE-Bench-CL enables direct evaluation of an agent's ability to accumulate experience, transfer knowledge across tasks, and resist catastrophic forgetting. We complement the dataset with (i) a preliminary analysis of inter-task structural similarity and contextual sensitivity, (ii) an interactive LangGraph-based evaluation framework augmented with a FAISS-backed semantic memory module, and (iii) a suite of specialized continual learning metrics -- including average accuracy, forgetting, forward/backward transfer, tool-use efficiency, and a generalized Composite Continual Learning Score and CL-F-beta score -- to capture the stability-plasticity trade-off. We outline a rigorous experimental protocol comparing memory-enabled and memory-disabled agents across diverse Python repositories. All code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/thomasjoshi/agents-never-forget, providing the community with a reproducible platform for developing more adaptive and robust AI agents in software engineering.</description>

      <title>Vision Transformer with Adversarial Indicator Token against Adversarial Attacks in Radio Signal Classifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable success of transformers across various fields such as natural language processing and computer vision has paved the way for their applications in automatic modulation classification, a critical component in the communication systems of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, it has been observed that transformer-based classification of radio signals is susceptible to subtle yet sophisticated adversarial attacks. To address this issue, we have developed a defensive strategy for transformer-based modulation classification systems to counter such adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel vision transformer (ViT) architecture by introducing a new concept known as adversarial indicator (AdvI) token to detect adversarial attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an AdvI token in ViT to defend against adversarial attacks. Integrating an adversarial training method with a detection mechanism using AdvI token, we combine a training time defense and running time defense in a unified neural network model, which reduces architectural complexity of the system compared to detecting adversarial perturbations using separate models. We investigate into the operational principles of our method by examining the attention mechanism. We show the proposed AdvI token acts as a crucial element within the ViT, influencing attention weights and thereby highlighting regions or features in the input data that are potentially suspicious or anomalous. Through experimental results, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses several competitive methods in handling white-box attack scenarios, including those utilizing the fast gradient method, projected gradient descent attacks and basic iterative method.</description>

      <title>Gradient-based Fine-Tuning through Pre-trained Model Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large pre-trained models have demonstrated extensive applications across various fields. However, fine-tuning these models for specific downstream tasks demands significant computational resources and storage. One fine-tuning method, gradient-based parameter selection (GPS), focuses on fine-tuning only the parameters with high gradients in each neuron, thereby reducing the number of training parameters. Nevertheless, this approach increases computational resource requirements and storage demands. In this paper, we propose an efficient gradient-based and regularized fine-tuning method (GRFT) that updates the rows or columns of the weight matrix. We theoretically demonstrate that the rows or columns with the highest sum of squared gradients are optimal for updating. This strategy effectively reduces storage overhead and improves the efficiency of parameter selection. Additionally, we incorporate regularization to enhance knowledge transfer from the pre-trained model. GRFT achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods such as GPS, Adapter Tuning, and LoRA. Notably, GRFT requires updating only 1.22% and 0.30% of the total parameters on FGVC and VTAB datasets, respectively, demonstrating its high efficiency and effectiveness. The source code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Implicit Reward as the Bridge: A Unified View of SFT and DPO Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-training processes are essential phases in grounding pre-trained language models to real-world tasks, with learning from demonstrations or preference signals playing a crucial role in this adaptation. We present a unified theoretical framework bridging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and preference learning in Large Language Model (LLM) post-training. Through rigorous mathematical derivation, we demonstrate that both SFT and preference learning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) operate within the same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT representing a special case of implicit reward learning. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation in conventional SFT: the KL divergence term in distribution matching becomes constant with respect to the policy during optimization, failing to constrain model updates. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective learning rate reduction approach that yields significant performance improvements (up to \textbf{25\%} relative gain and \textbf{6\%} absolute win rate increase in instruction following tasks. Additionally, we derive alternative SFT objectives from various f-divergence functions that preserve the KL term during optimization, further enhancing post-DPO model performance. Finally, we extend the theoretical relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference learning to the SFT context, providing mathematical derivations and experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inspired Encoding Strategies for Machine Learning Models: Proposing and Evaluating Instance Level, Global Discrete, and Class Conditional Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose, evaluate and compare three quantum inspired data encoding strategies, Instance Level Strategy (ILS), Global Discrete Strategy (GDS) and Class Conditional Value Strategy (CCVS), for transforming classical data into quantum data for use in pure classical machine learning models. The primary objective is to reduce high encoding time while ensuring correct encoding values and analyzing their impact on classification performance. The Instance Level Strategy treats each row of dataset independently; mimics local quantum states. Global Discrete Value Based encoding strategy maps all unique feature values across the full dataset to quantum states uniformly. In contrast, the Class conditional Value based encoding strategy encodes unique values separately for each class, preserving class dependent information.
  We apply these encoding strategies to a classification task and assess their impact on en-coding efficiency, correctness, model accuracy, and computational cost. By analyzing the trade offs between encoding time, precision, and predictive performance, this study provides insights into optimizing quantum inspired data transformations for classical machine learning workflows.</description>

Abstract: Gated Linear Units (GLU) have shown great potential in enhancing neural network performance. In this paper, I introduce a novel attention mechanism called GLU Attention, which introduces nonlinearity into the values of Attention. My experiments demonstrate that GLU Attention improves both model performance and convergence speed across text and vision modalities with zero additional parameters and negligible computational costs. GLU Attention is lightweight and can seamlessly integrate with other technologies, such as Flash Attention, Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), and various Multi-Head Attention (MHA) variants such as Grouped-Query Attention (GQA).

      <title>AIMatDesign: Knowledge-Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Inverse Materials Design under Data Scarcity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing demand for novel materials, machine learning-driven inverse design methods face significant challenges in reconciling the high-dimensional materials composition space with limited experimental data. Existing approaches suffer from two major limitations: (I) machine learning models often lack reliability in high-dimensional spaces, leading to prediction biases during the design process; (II) these models fail to effectively incorporate domain expert knowledge, limiting their capacity to support knowledge-guided inverse design. To address these challenges, we introduce AIMatDesign, a reinforcement learning framework that addresses these limitations by augmenting experimental data using difference-based algorithms to build a trusted experience pool, accelerating model convergence. To enhance model reliability, an automated refinement strategy guided by large language models (LLMs) dynamically corrects prediction inconsistencies, reinforcing alignment between reward signals and state value functions. Additionally, a knowledge-based reward function leverages expert domain rules to improve stability and efficiency during training. Our experiments demonstrate that AIMatDesign significantly surpasses traditional machine learning and reinforcement learning methods in discovery efficiency, convergence speed, and success rates. Among the numerous candidates proposed by AIMatDesign, experimental synthesis of representative Zr-based alloys yielded a top-performing BMG with 1.7GPa yield strength and 10.2\% elongation, closely matching predictions. Moreover, the framework accurately captured the trend of yield strength variation with composition, demonstrating its reliability and potential for closed-loop materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Generalizing to New Dynamical Systems via Frequency Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning the underlying dynamics from data with deep neural networks has shown remarkable potential in modeling various complex physical dynamics. However, current approaches are constrained in their ability to make reliable predictions in a specific domain and struggle with generalizing to unseen systems that are governed by the same general dynamics but differ in environmental characteristics. In this work, we formulate a parameter-efficient method, Fourier Neural Simulator for Dynamical Adaptation (FNSDA), that can readily generalize to new dynamics via adaptation in the Fourier space. Specifically, FNSDA identifies the shareable dynamics based on the known environments using an automatic partition in Fourier modes and learns to adjust the modes specific for each new environment by conditioning on low-dimensional latent systematic parameters for efficient generalization. We evaluate our approach on four representative families of dynamic systems, and the results show that FNSDA can achieve superior or competitive generalization performance compared to existing methods with a significantly reduced parameter cost.

      <title>ROSE: Toward Reality-Oriented Safety Evaluation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as black-box components in real-world applications, evaluating their safety-especially under adversarial prompting-has become critical. Arguably, effective safety evaluations should be adaptive, evolving with LLM capabilities, and also cover a broad spectrum of harmful topics and real-world scenarios to fully expose potential vulnerabilities. Existing manual safety benchmarks, built on handcrafted adversarial prompts, are limited by their static nature and the intensive labor required to update them, making it difficult to keep pace with rapidly advancing LLMs. In contrast, automated adversarial prompt generation offers a promising path toward adaptive evaluation. However, current methods often suffer from insufficient adversarial topic coverage (topic-level diversity) and weak alignment with real-world contexts. These shortcomings stem from the exploration-exploitation dilemma in black-box optimization and a lack of real-world contextualization, resulting in adversarial prompts that are both topically narrow and scenario-repetitive. To address these issues, we propose Reality-Oriented Safety Evaluation (ROSE), a novel framework that uses multi-objective reinforcement learning to fine-tune an adversarial LLM for generating topically diverse and contextually rich adversarial prompts. Experiments show that ROSE outperforms existing methods in uncovering safety vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs, with notable improvements in integrated evaluation metrics. We hope ROSE represents a step toward more practical and reality-oriented safety evaluation of LLMs. WARNING: This paper contains examples of potentially harmful text.</description>

      <title>HiT-JEPA: A Hierarchical Self-supervised Trajectory Embedding Framework for Similarity Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The representation of urban trajectory data plays a critical role in effectively analyzing spatial movement patterns. Despite considerable progress, the challenge of designing trajectory representations that can capture diverse and complementary information remains an open research problem. Existing methods struggle in incorporating trajectory fine-grained details and high-level summary in a single model, limiting their ability to attend to both long-term dependencies while preserving local nuances. To address this, we propose HiT-JEPA (Hierarchical Interactions of Trajectory Semantics via a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture), a unified framework for learning multi-scale urban trajectory representations across semantic abstraction levels. HiT-JEPA adopts a three-layer hierarchy that progressively captures point-level fine-grained details, intermediate patterns, and high-level trajectory abstractions, enabling the model to integrate both local dynamics and global semantics in one coherent structure. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets for trajectory similarity computation show that HiT-JEPA's hierarchical design yields richer, multi-scale representations. Code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HiT-JEPA.</description>

      <title>LoRA-Mixer: Coordinate Modular LoRA Experts Through Serial Attention Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent efforts to combine low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) for adapting large language models (LLMs) to multiple tasks still exhibit prevailing limitations: they either swap entire attention/feed-forward layers for switch experts or bolt on parallel expert branches, diluting parameter efficiency and task fidelity. We propose the LoRA-Mixer, a modular and lightweight MoE framework that integrates LoRA experts. Our core innovation lies in replacing the projection matrices of the attention module's input/output linear layers with dynamically routed, task-specific LoRA experts. This design ensures seamless compatibility with diverse foundation models, including transformers and state space models (SSMs), by leveraging their inherent linear projection structures. The framework supports two operational paradigms: (1) joint optimization of LoRA experts and routing mechanisms via a novel hard-soft routing strategy, or (2) direct deployment of pre-trained, frozen LoRA modules sourced from external repositories. To enable robust router training with limited data while ensuring stable routing decisions and maximizing expert reuse, we introduce an adaptive Specialization Balance Loss (SBL) that jointly optimizes expert balance and task-specific alignment. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets, including MedQA, CoLA, SST-2, GSM8K, ARC-E, ARC-C, and HumanEval, demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRA-Mixer. On datasets such as GSM8K, HumanEval, and MedQA, LoRA-Mixer achieves significant improvements of 7.61%, 4.88%, and 3.08% over the base models, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, LoRA-Mixer achieves additional improvements of 1.09%, 1.45%, and 1.68%, respectively, using only 48% of the parameters, demonstrating its efficiency and strong performance.</description>

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in complex sequential decision-making tasks, such as playing Atari 2600 games and mastering board games. A critical yet underexplored aspect of DRL is the temporal scale of action execution. We propose a novel paradigm that integrates contextual bandits with DRL to adaptively select action durations, enhancing policy flexibility and computational efficiency. Our approach augments a Deep Q-Network (DQN) with a contextual bandit module that learns to choose optimal action repetition rates based on state contexts. Experiments on Atari 2600 games demonstrate significant performance improvements over static duration baselines, highlighting the efficacy of adaptive temporal abstractions in DRL. This paradigm offers a scalable solution for real-time applications like gaming and robotics, where dynamic action durations are critical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce KUL-KT, a biologically inspired architecture for knowledge tracing (KT), combining Hebbian memory encoding with gradient-based consolidation in a scalable, input-agnostic framework. KUL-KT adapts the principle of memory consolidation in neural systems, to student modeling by introducing two key innovations: (i) a time-decaying Hebbian memory update that enables graceful forgetting, and (ii) a novel Loss-aligned Internal Target (LIT) method to compute an ideal internal state, allowing continual learning without backpropagation through time. The architecture consists of a fast Hebbian memory that captures each learner interaction via a single associative update, and a slower linear network that consolidates recalled samples through gradient descent. This design enables few-shot personalization and natural forgetting without storing raw data or relying on large cohort training. Operating entirely in embedding space, KUL-KT supports both structured (tabular) and unstructured (short-answer) inputs. Empirically, KUL-KT outperforms strong baselines on ten public KT benchmarks in rank-sensitive metrics such as nDCG and Recall@10. In a classroom deployment, KUL-KT personalized quizzes from short-answer data, leading to improved learner-perceived helpfulness and reduced difficulty (p &lt; 0.05). Ablation studies confirm that Hebbian decay and LIT are critical for continual adaptation. Compared to a strong graph-based KT model, KUL-KT trains 1.75x faster and uses 99.01\% less memory. These results position KUL-KT as a biologically grounded, memory-efficient, and input-flexible framework for personalized learning at scale.</description>

      <title>Moment Sampling in Video LLMs for Long-Form Video QA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in video large language models (Video LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of video question answering (VideoQA). While existing methods perform well on short videos, they often struggle with long-range reasoning in longer videos. To scale Video LLMs for longer video content, frame sub-sampling (selecting frames at regular intervals) is commonly used. However, this approach is suboptimal, often leading to the loss of crucial frames or the inclusion of redundant information from multiple similar frames. Missing key frames impairs the model's ability to answer questions accurately, while redundant frames lead the model to focus on irrelevant video segments and increase computational resource consumption. In this paper, we investigate the use of a general-purpose text-to-video moment retrieval model to guide the frame sampling process. We propose "moment sampling", a novel, model-agnostic approach that enables the model to select the most relevant frames according to the context of the question. Specifically, we employ a lightweight moment retrieval model to prioritize frame selection. By focusing on the frames most pertinent to the given question, our method enhances long-form VideoQA performance in Video LLMs. Through extensive experiments on four long-form VideoQA datasets, using four state-of-the-art Video LLMs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model fusion aims to combine the knowledge of multiple models by creating one representative model that captures the strengths of all of its parents. However, this process is non-trivial due to differences in internal representations, which can stem from permutation invariance, random initialization, or differently distributed training data. We present a novel, neuron-centric family of model fusion algorithms designed to integrate multiple trained neural networks into a single network effectively regardless of training data distribution. Our algorithms group intermediate neurons of parent models to create target representations that the fused model approximates with its corresponding sub-network. Unlike prior approaches, our approach incorporates neuron attribution scores into the fusion process. Furthermore, our algorithms can generalize to arbitrary layer types. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our algorithms consistently outperform previous fusion techniques, particularly in zero-shot and non-IID fusion scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/AndrewSpano/neuron-interpolation-model-fusion.</description>

Abstract: Data reduction plays a vital role in data-centric AI by identifying the most informative instance within large-scale datasets to enhance model training efficiency. The core challenge lies in how to select the optimal instances-rather than the entire datasets-to improve data quality and training efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective data reduction strategy based on Pointwise V-information(PVI). First, we quantify instance difficulty using PVI and filter out low-difficulty instances enabling a static approach. Experiments demonstrate that removing 10%-30% of the data preserves the classifier performance with only a 0.0001% to 0.76% loss in accuracy.Second, we use a progressive learning approach to training the classifiers on instances sorted by ascending PVI, accelerating convergence and achieving a 0.8% accuracy gain over conventional training. Our results suggest that with the effective data reduction strategy, training a classifier on the selected optimal subset could enhance the model performance and boost training efficiency. Moreover, we have transferred the PVI framework, which previously applied only to English datasets, to diverse Chinese NLP tasks and base models, leading to valuable insights for cross-lingual data reduction and faster training.

      <title>Pattern-Based Graph Classification: Comparison of Quality Measures and Importance of Preprocessing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph classification aims to categorize graphs based on their structural and attribute features, with applications in diverse fields such as social network analysis and bioinformatics. Among the methods proposed to solve this task, those relying on patterns (i.e. subgraphs) provide good explainability, as the patterns used for classification can be directly interpreted. To identify meaningful patterns, a standard approach is to use a quality measure, i.e. a function that evaluates the discriminative power of each pattern. However, the literature provides tens of such measures, making it difficult to select the most appropriate for a given application. Only a handful of surveys try to provide some insight by comparing these measures, and none of them specifically focuses on graphs. This typically results in the systematic use of the most widespread measures, without thorough evaluation. To address this issue, we present a comparative analysis of 38 quality measures from the literature. We characterize them theoretically, based on four mathematical properties. We leverage publicly available datasets to constitute a benchmark, and propose a method to elaborate a gold standard ranking of the patterns. We exploit these resources to perform an empirical comparison of the measures, both in terms of pattern ranking and classification performance. Moreover, we propose a clustering-based preprocessing step, which groups patterns appearing in the same graphs to enhance classification performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this step, reducing the number of patterns to be processed while achieving comparable performance. Additionally, we show that some popular measures widely used in the literature are not associated with the best results.</description>

      <title>Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation via Discrepancy-Weighted Experience Replay</title>

Abstract: Continually adapting edge models in cloud-edge collaborative object detection for traffic monitoring suffers from catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously learned knowledge when adapting to new data distributions. This is especially problematic in dynamic traffic environments characterised by periodic variations (e.g., day/night, peak hours), where past knowledge remains valuable. Existing approaches like experience replay and visual prompts offer some mitigation, but struggle to effectively prioritize and leverage historical data for optimal knowledge retention and adaptation. Specifically, simply storing and replaying all historical data can be inefficient, while treating all historical experiences as equally important overlooks their varying relevance to the current domain. This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model update algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these limitations. ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based Experience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target domains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar to the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates the retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also preventing overfitting to the new domain. The experience buffer is also updated using a simple random sampling strategy to maintain a balanced representation of previous domains. Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset, involving repeated day/night cycles, demonstrate that ER-EMU consistently improves the performance of several state-of-the-art cloud-edge collaborative object detection frameworks.</description>

      <title>MR-CLIP: Efficient Metadata-Guided Learning of MRI Contrast Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans in clinical systems is based on a precise understanding of image contrast. This contrast is primarily governed by acquisition parameters, such as echo time and repetition time, which are stored in the DICOM metadata. To simplify contrast identification, broad labels such as T1-weighted or T2-weighted are commonly used, but these offer only a coarse approximation of the underlying acquisition settings. In many real-world datasets, such labels are entirely missing, leaving raw acquisition parameters as the only indicators of contrast. Adding to this challenge, the available metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or inconsistent. The lack of reliable and standardized metadata complicates tasks such as image interpretation, retrieval, and integration into clinical workflows. Furthermore, robust contrast-aware representations are essential to enable more advanced clinical applications, such as achieving modality-invariant representations and data harmonization. To address these challenges, we propose MR-CLIP, a multimodal contrastive learning framework that aligns MR images with their DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware representations, without relying on manual labels. Trained on a diverse clinical dataset that spans various scanners and protocols, MR-CLIP captures contrast variations across acquisitions and within scans, enabling anatomy-invariant representations. We demonstrate its effectiveness in cross-modal retrieval and contrast classification, highlighting its scalability and potential for further clinical applications. The code and weights are publicly available at https://github.com/myigitavci/MR-CLIP.</description>

      <title>HistoART: Histopathology Artifact Detection and Reporting Tool</title>

Abstract: In modern cancer diagnostics, Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) is widely used to digitize tissue specimens for detailed, high-resolution examination; however, other diagnostic approaches, such as liquid biopsy and molecular testing, are also utilized based on the cancer type and clinical context. While WSI has revolutionized digital histopathology by enabling automated, precise analysis, it remains vulnerable to artifacts introduced during slide preparation and scanning. These artifacts can compromise downstream image analysis. To address this challenge, we propose and compare three robust artifact detection approaches for WSIs: (1) a foundation model-based approach (FMA) using a fine-tuned Unified Neural Image (UNI) architecture, (2) a deep learning approach (DLA) built on a ResNet50 backbone, and (3) a knowledge-based approach (KBA) leveraging handcrafted features from texture, color, and frequency-based metrics. The methods target six common artifact types: tissue folds, out-of-focus regions, air bubbles, tissue damage, marker traces, and blood contamination. Evaluations were conducted on 50,000+ image patches from diverse scanners (Hamamatsu, Philips, Leica Aperio AT2) across multiple sites. The FMA achieved the highest patch-wise AUROC of 0.995 (95% CI [0.994, 0.995]), outperforming the ResNet50-based method (AUROC: 0.977, 95% CI [0.977, 0.978]) and the KBA (AUROC: 0.940, 95% CI [0.933, 0.946]). To translate detection into actionable insights, we developed a quality report scorecard that quantifies high-quality patches and visualizes artifact distributions.</description>

      <title>CaughtCheating: Is Your MLLM a Good Cheating Detective? Exploring the Boundary of Visual Perception and Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent agentic Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) such as GPT-o3 have achieved near-ceiling scores on various existing benchmarks, motivating a demand for more challenging test tasks. These MLLMs have been reported to excel in a few expert-level tasks for humans, e.g., GeoGuesser, reflecting their potential as a detective who can notice minuscule cues in an image and weave them into coherent, situational explanations, leading to a reliable answer. But can they match the performance of excellent human detectives? To answer this question, we investigate some hard scenarios where GPT-o3 can still handle, and find a common scenario where o3's performance drops to nearly zero, which we name CaughtCheating. It is inspired by the social media requests that ask others to detect suspicious clues from photos shared by the poster's partner. We conduct extensive experiments and analysis to understand why existing MLLMs lack sufficient capability to solve this kind of task. CaughtCheating provides a class of challenging visual perception and reasoning tasks with great value and practical usage. Success in these tasks paves the way for MLLMs to acquire human-level detective perception and reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>VSF-Med:A Vulnerability Scoring Framework for Medical Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) hold great promise for streamlining labour-intensive medical imaging workflows, yet systematic security evaluations in clinical settings remain scarce. We introduce VSF--Med, an end-to-end vulnerability-scoring framework for medical VLMs that unites three novel components: (i) a rich library of sophisticated text-prompt attack templates targeting emerging threat vectors; (ii) imperceptible visual perturbations calibrated by structural similarity (SSIM) thresholds to preserve clinical realism; and (iii) an eight-dimensional rubric evaluated by two independent judge LLMs, whose raw scores are consolidated via z-score normalization to yield a 0--32 composite risk metric. Built entirely on publicly available datasets and accompanied by open-source code, VSF--Med synthesizes over 30,000 adversarial variants from 5,000 radiology images and enables reproducible benchmarking of any medical VLM with a single command. Our consolidated analysis reports mean z-score shifts of $0.90\sigma$ for persistence-of-attack-effects, $0.74\sigma$ for prompt-injection effectiveness, and $0.63\sigma$ for safety-bypass success across state-of-the-art VLMs. Notably, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct exhibits a peak vulnerability increase of $1.29\sigma$ for persistence-of-attack-effects, while GPT-4o shows increases of $0.69\sigma$ for that same vector and $0.28\sigma$ for prompt-injection attacks.</description>

      <title>Estimating Correctness Without Oracles in LLM-Based Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating code from natural language specifications is one of the most successful applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, they hallucinate: LLMs produce outputs that may be grammatically correct but are factually incorrect. Without an existing, correct implementation (i.e., an oracle), can we quantify how likely the generated program is correct?
  In this paper, we propose a measure of incorrectness, called incoherence, that can be estimated efficiently in the absence of an oracle and provides a lower bound on the error, i.e., the probability that the LLM-generated program for that specification is incorrect. Our experiments demonstrate an extraordinary effectiveness. For the average code generation task, our incoherence-based methodology can automatically identify about two-thirds of incorrect programs without reports of false positives. In fact, an oracle-based evaluation of LLMs can be reliably replaced by an incoherence-based evaluation. In particular, we find a very strong agreement between the ranking of LLMs by the number of programs deemed correct via an oracle (pass@1) and the ranking of LLMs by the number of programs deemed correct via our incoherence.</description>

      <title>Smooth-Distill: A Self-distillation Framework for Multitask Learning with Wearable Sensor Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Smooth-Distill, a novel self-distillation framework designed to simultaneously perform human activity recognition (HAR) and sensor placement detection using wearable sensor data. The proposed approach utilizes a unified CNN-based architecture, MTL-net, which processes accelerometer data and branches into two outputs for each respective task. Unlike conventional distillation methods that require separate teacher and student models, the proposed framework utilizes a smoothed, historical version of the model itself as the teacher, significantly reducing training computational overhead while maintaining performance benefits. To support this research, we developed a comprehensive accelerometer-based dataset capturing 12 distinct sleep postures across three different wearing positions, complementing two existing public datasets (MHealth and WISDM). Experimental results show that Smooth-Distill consistently outperforms alternative approaches across different evaluation scenarios, achieving notable improvements in both human activity recognition and device placement detection tasks. This method demonstrates enhanced stability in convergence patterns during training and exhibits reduced overfitting compared to traditional multitask learning baselines. This framework contributes to the practical implementation of knowledge distillation in human activity recognition systems, offering an effective solution for multitask learning with accelerometer data that balances accuracy and training efficiency. More broadly, it reduces the computational cost of model training, which is critical for scenarios requiring frequent model updates or training on resource-constrained platforms. The code and model are available at https://github.com/Kuan2vn/smooth\_distill.</description>

      <title>InSight-R: A Framework for Risk-informed Human Failure Event Identification and Interface-Induced Risk Assessment Driven by AutoGraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human reliability remains a critical concern in safety-critical domains such as nuclear power, where operational failures are often linked to human error. While conventional human reliability analysis (HRA) methods have been widely adopted, they rely heavily on expert judgment for identifying human failure events (HFEs) and assigning performance influencing factors (PIFs). This reliance introduces challenges related to reproducibility, subjectivity, and limited integration of interface-level data. In particular, current approaches lack the capacity to rigorously assess how human-machine interface design contributes to operator performance variability and error susceptibility. To address these limitations, this study proposes a framework for risk-informed human failure event identification and interface-induced risk assessment driven by AutoGraph (InSight-R). By linking empirical behavioral data to the interface-embedded knowledge graph (IE-KG) constructed by the automated graph-based execution framework (AutoGraph), the InSight-R framework enables automated HFE identification based on both error-prone and time-deviated operational paths. Furthermore, we discuss the relationship between designer-user conflicts and human error. The results demonstrate that InSight-R not only enhances the objectivity and interpretability of HFE identification but also provides a scalable pathway toward dynamic, real-time human reliability assessment in digitalized control environments. This framework offers actionable insights for interface design optimization and contributes to the advancement of mechanism-driven HRA methodologies.</description>

      <title>MANTA: Cross-Modal Semantic Alignment and Information-Theoretic Optimization for Long-form Multimodal Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While multi-modal learning has advanced significantly, current approaches often treat modalities separately, creating inconsistencies in representation and reasoning. We introduce MANTA (Multi-modal Abstraction and Normalization via Textual Alignment), a theoretically-grounded framework that unifies visual and auditory inputs into a structured textual space for seamless processing with large language models. MANTA addresses four key challenges: (1) semantic alignment across modalities with information-theoretic optimization, (2) adaptive temporal synchronization for varying information densities, (3) hierarchical content representation for multi-scale understanding, and (4) context-aware retrieval of sparse information from long sequences. We formalize our approach within a rigorous mathematical framework, proving its optimality for context selection under token constraints. Extensive experiments on the challenging task of Long Video Question Answering show that MANTA improves state-of-the-art models by up to 22.6% in overall accuracy, with particularly significant gains (27.3%) on videos exceeding 30 minutes. Additionally, we demonstrate MANTA's superiority on temporal reasoning tasks (23.8% improvement) and cross-modal understanding (25.1% improvement). Our framework introduces novel density estimation techniques for redundancy minimization while preserving rare signals, establishing new foundations for unifying multimodal representations through structured text.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plant diseases pose significant challenges to farmers and the agricultural sector at large. However, early detection of plant diseases is crucial to mitigating their effects and preventing widespread damage, as outbreaks can severely impact the productivity and quality of crops. With advancements in technology, there are increasing opportunities for automating the monitoring and detection of disease outbreaks in plants. This study proposed a system designed to identify and monitor plant diseases using a transfer learning approach. Specifically, the study utilizes YOLOv7 and YOLOv8, two state-ofthe-art models in the field of object detection. By fine-tuning these models on a dataset of plant leaf images, the system is able to accurately detect the presence of Bacteria, Fungi and Viral diseases such as Powdery Mildew, Angular Leaf Spot, Early blight and Tomato mosaic virus. The model's performance was evaluated using several metrics, including mean Average Precision (mAP), F1-score, Precision, and Recall, yielding values of 91.05, 89.40, 91.22, and 87.66, respectively. The result demonstrates the superior effectiveness and efficiency of YOLOv8 compared to other object detection methods, highlighting its potential for use in modern agricultural practices. The approach provides a scalable, automated solution for early any plant disease detection, contributing to enhanced crop yield, reduced reliance on manual monitoring, and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Modeling of LLM Self-Improvement Training Dynamics Through Solver-Verifier Gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-improvement is among the most prominent techniques within the realm of large language models (LLM), aiming to enhance the LLM performance without relying on external data. Despite its significance, generally how LLM performances evolve during the self-improvement process remains underexplored. In this paper, we theoretically model the training dynamics of self-improvement via the concept of solver-verifier gap. This is inspired by the conjecture that the performance enhancement of self-improvement stems from the gap between LLM's solver capability and verifier capability. Based on the theoretical framework, we further introduce how to predict the ultimate power of self-improvement using only information from the first few training epochs. We empirically validate the effectiveness of the theoretical model on various LLMs and datasets. Beyond self-improvement, we extend our analysis to investigate how external data influences these dynamics within the framework. Notably, we find that under limited external data regimes, such external data can be utilized at any stage without significantly affecting final performances, which accords with the empirical observations.</description>

Abstract: With the rise of large language models, the paradigm of training foundation models with massive parameter counts on vast datasets has been adopted in multiple domains to achieve remarkable success. Time series foundation models represent a significant extension of this paradigm, demonstrating exceptional expressive power, generalization, and cross-domain transferability. However, this gives rise to a fundamental paradox: time series data reflect distinct dynamical systems, making cross-domain transfer intuitively implausible, yet this is contradicted by the models' empirical success. To resolve this paradox, this paper investigates, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, the representation learning mechanisms and generalization capabilities of patch-based time series foundation models. We argue that such models are not merely applying a new architecture but are fundamentally generalizing the representation paradigm of language models by extending deterministic vector-based representations to latent probabilistic distributional forms. Our theoretical analysis supports this framework by demonstrating that continuous time-series patches can be faithfully quantized into a discrete vocabulary whose key statistical properties are highly consistent with those of natural language. This generalization allows time series models to inherit the robust representation and transfer abilities of large language models, thereby explaining their superior performance in temporal tasks. Ultimately, our work provides a rigorous theoretical cornerstone for understanding, evaluating, and improving the safety and reliability of large-scale time series foundation models.</description>

      <title>State and Memory is All You Need for Robust and Reliable AI Agents</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful advances in natural language understanding and generation. Yet their application to complex, real-world scientific workflows remain limited by challenges in memory, planning, and tool integration. Here, we introduce SciBORG (Scientific Bespoke Artificial Intelligence Agents Optimized for Research Goals), a modular agentic framework that allows LLM-based agents to autonomously plan, reason, and achieve robust and reliable domain-specific task execution. Agents are constructed dynamically from source code documentation and augmented with finite-state automata (FSA) memory, enabling persistent state tracking and context-aware decision-making. This approach eliminates the need for manual prompt engineering and allows for robust, scalable deployment across diverse applications via maintaining context across extended workflows and to recover from tool or execution failures. We validate SciBORG through integration with both physical and virtual hardware, such as microwave synthesizers for executing user-specified reactions, with context-aware decision making and demonstrate its use in autonomous multi-step bioassay retrieval from the PubChem database utilizing multi-step planning, reasoning, agent-to-agent communication and coordination for execution of exploratory tasks. Systematic benchmarking shows that SciBORG agents achieve reliable execution, adaptive planning, and interpretable state transitions. Our results show that memory and state awareness are critical enablers of agentic planning and reliability, offering a generalizable foundation for deploying AI agents in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning-Enabled Hybrid Language Models for Communication-Efficient Token Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid Language Models (HLMs) combine the low-latency efficiency of Small Language Models (SLMs) on edge devices with the high accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) on centralized servers. Unlike traditional end-to-end LLM inference, HLMs reduce latency and communication by invoking LLMs only when local SLM predictions are uncertain, i.e., when token-level confidence is low or entropy is high. However, ambiguous or low-confidence predictions still require frequent offloading to the LLM, leading to significant communication overhead in bandwidth-constrained settings. To address this, we propose FedHLM, a communication-efficient HLM framework that integrates uncertainty-aware inference with Federated Learning (FL). FedHLM's key innovation lies in collaboratively learning token-level uncertainty thresholds that govern when LLM assistance is needed. Rather than using static or manually tuned thresholds, FedHLM employs FL to optimize these thresholds in a privacy-preserving, distributed manner. Additionally, it leverages embedding-based token representations for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) resolution, enabling clients to reuse tokens inferred by semantically similar peers without engaging the LLM. We further introduce hierarchical model aggregation: edge servers refine local routing policies through client updates, while cross-cluster coordination aligns global decision boundaries. This layered design captures recurring uncertainty patterns, reducing redundant LLM queries. Experiments on large-scale news classification tasks show that FedHLM reduces LLM transmissions by over 95 percent with negligible accuracy loss, making it well-suited for scalable and efficient edge-AI applications.</description>

      <title>Strategic Counterfactual Modeling of Deep-Target Airstrike Systems via Intervention-Aware Spatio-Causal Graph Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the lack of structured causal modeling between tactical strike behavior and strategic delay in current strategic-level simulations, particularly the structural bottlenecks in capturing intermediate variables within the "resilience - nodal suppression - negotiation window" chain. We propose the Intervention-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (IA-STGNN), a novel framework that closes the causal loop from tactical input to strategic delay output. The model integrates graph attention mechanisms, counterfactual simulation units, and spatial intervention node reconstruction to enable dynamic simulations of strike configurations and synchronization strategies. Training data are generated from a multi-physics simulation platform (GEANT4 + COMSOL) under NIST SP 800-160 standards, ensuring structural traceability and policy-level validation. Experimental results demonstrate that IA-STGNN significantly outperforms baseline models (ST-GNN, GCN-LSTM, XGBoost), achieving a 12.8 percent reduction in MAE and 18.4 percent increase in Top-5 percent accuracy, while improving causal path consistency and intervention stability. IA-STGNN enables interpretable prediction of strategic delay and supports applications such as nuclear deterrence simulation, diplomatic window assessment, and multi-strategy optimization, providing a structured and transparent AI decision-support mechanism for high-level policy modeling.</description>

      <title>A Joint Topology-Data Fusion Graph Network for Robust Traffic Speed Prediction with Data Anomalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), yet current methods struggle with the inherent complexity and non-linearity of traffic dynamics, making it difficult to integrate spatial and temporal characteristics. Furthermore, existing approaches use static techniques to address non-stationary and anomalous historical data, which limits adaptability and undermines data smoothing. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Graph Fusion Enhanced Network (GFEN), an innovative framework for network-level traffic speed prediction. GFEN introduces a novel topological spatiotemporal graph fusion technique that meticulously extracts and merges spatial and temporal correlations from both data distribution and network topology using trainable methods, enabling the modeling of multi-scale spatiotemporal features. Additionally, GFEN employs a hybrid methodology combining a k-th order difference-based mathematical framework with an attention-based deep learning structure to adaptively smooth historical observations and dynamically mitigate data anomalies and non-stationarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GFEN surpasses state-of-the-art methods by approximately 6.3% in prediction accuracy and exhibits convergence rates nearly twice as fast as recent hybrid models, confirming its superior performance and potential to significantly enhance traffic prediction system efficiency.</description>

      <title>pUniFind: a unified large pre-trained deep learning model pushing the limit of mass spectra interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has advanced mass spectrometry data interpretation, yet most models remain feature extractors rather than unified scoring frameworks. We present pUniFind, the first large-scale multimodal pre-trained model in proteomics that integrates end-to-end peptide-spectrum scoring with open, zero-shot de novo sequencing. Trained on over 100 million open search-derived spectra, pUniFind aligns spectral and peptide modalities via cross modality prediction and outperforms traditional engines across diverse datasets, particularly achieving a 42.6 percent increase in the number of identified peptides in immunopeptidomics. Supporting over 1,300 modifications, pUniFind identifies 60 percent more PSMs than existing de novo methods despite a 300-fold larger search space. A deep learning based quality control module further recovers 38.5 percent additional peptides including 1,891 mapped to the genome but absent from reference proteomes while preserving full fragment ion coverage. These results establish a unified, scalable deep learning framework for proteomic analysis, offering improved sensitivity, modification coverage, and interpretability.</description>

      <title>How large language models judge and influence human cooperation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to support decisions in social settings. Previous work suggests that such tools shape people's moral and political judgements. However, the long-term implications of LLM-based social decision-making remain unknown. How will human cooperation be affected when the assessment of social interactions relies on language models? This is a pressing question, as human cooperation is often driven by indirect reciprocity, reputations, and the capacity to judge interactions of others. Here, we assess how state-of-the-art LLMs judge cooperative actions. We provide 21 different LLMs with an extensive set of examples where individuals cooperate -- or refuse cooperating -- in a range of social contexts, and ask how these interactions should be judged. Furthermore, through an evolutionary game-theoretical model, we evaluate cooperation dynamics in populations where the extracted LLM-driven judgements prevail, assessing the long-term impact of LLMs on human prosociality. We observe a remarkable agreement in evaluating cooperation against good opponents. On the other hand, we notice within- and between-model variance when judging cooperation with ill-reputed individuals. We show that the differences revealed between models can significantly impact the prevalence of cooperation. Finally, we test prompts to steer LLM norms, showing that such interventions can shape LLM judgements, particularly through goal-oriented prompts. Our research connects LLM-based advices and long-term social dynamics, and highlights the need to carefully align LLM norms in order to preserve human cooperation.</description>

      <title>Generating Heterogeneous Multi-dimensional Data : A Comparative Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Allocation of personnel and material resources is highly sensible in the case of firefighter interventions. This allocation relies on simulations to experiment with various scenarios. The main objective of this allocation is the global optimization of the firefighters response. Data generation is then mandatory to study various scenarios In this study, we propose to compare different data generation methods. Methods such as Random Sampling, Tabular Variational Autoencoders, standard Generative Adversarial Networks, Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Probabilistic Models are examined to ascertain their efficacy in capturing the intricacies of firefighter interventions. Traditional evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the nuanced requirements of synthetic datasets for real-world scenarios. To address this gap, an evaluation of synthetic data quality is conducted using a combination of domain-specific metrics tailored to the firefighting domain and standard measures such as the Wasserstein distance. Domain-specific metrics include response time distribution, spatial-temporal distribution of interventions, and accidents representation. These metrics are designed to assess data variability, the preservation of fine and complex correlations and anomalies such as event with a very low occurrence, the conformity with the initial statistical distribution and the operational relevance of the synthetic data. The distribution has the particularity of being highly unbalanced, none of the variables following a Gaussian distribution, adding complexity to the data generation process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximal Ancestral Graphs (MAGs) provide an abstract representation of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) with latent (selection) variables. These graphical objects encode information about ancestral relations and d-separations of the DAGs they represent. This abstract representation has been used amongst others to prove the soundness and completeness of the FCI algorithm for causal discovery, and to derive a do-calculus for its output. One significant inherent limitation of MAGs is that they rule out the possibility of cyclic causal relationships. In this work, we address that limitation. We introduce and study a class of graphical objects that we coin ''$\sigma$-Maximal Ancestral Graphs'' (''$\sigma$-MAGs''). We show how these graphs provide an abstract representation of (possibly cyclic) Directed Graphs (DGs) with latent (selection) variables, analogously to how MAGs represent DAGs. We study the properties of these objects and provide a characterization of their Markov equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Efficient Conformance Checking of Rich Data-Aware Declare Specifications (Extended)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in process analysis and mining for data-aware specifications, alignment-based conformance checking for declarative process models has focused on pure control-flow specifications, or mild data-aware extensions limited to numerical data and variable-to-constant comparisons. This is not surprising: finding alignments is computationally hard, even more so in the presence of data dependencies. In this paper, we challenge this problem in the case where the reference model is captured using data-aware Declare with general data types and data conditions. We show that, unexpectedly, it is possible to compute data-aware optimal alignments in this rich setting, enjoying at once efficiency and expressiveness. This is achieved by carefully combining the two best-known approaches to deal with control flow and data dependencies when computing alignments, namely A* search and SMT solving. Specifically, we introduce a novel algorithmic technique that efficiently explores the search space, generating descendant states through the application of repair actions aiming at incrementally resolving constraint violations. We prove the correctness of our algorithm and experimentally show its efficiency. The evaluation witnesses that our approach matches or surpasses the performance of the state of the art while also supporting significantly more expressive data dependencies, showcasing its potential to support real-world applications.</description>

      <title>AI-Governed Agent Architecture for Web-Trustworthy Tokenization of Alternative Assets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alternative Assets tokenization is transforming non-traditional financial instruments are represented and traded on the web. However, ensuring trustworthiness in web-based tokenized ecosystems poses significant challenges, from verifying off-chain asset data to enforcing regulatory compliance. This paper proposes an AI-governed agent architecture that integrates intelligent agents with blockchain to achieve web-trustworthy tokenization of alternative assets. In the proposed architecture, autonomous agents orchestrate the tokenization process (asset verification, valuation, compliance checking, and lifecycle management), while an AI-driven governance layer monitors agent behavior and enforces trust through adaptive policies and cryptoeconomic incentives. We demonstrate that this approach enhances transparency, security, and compliance in asset tokenization, addressing key concerns around data authenticity and fraud. A case study on tokenizing real estate assets illustrates how the architecture mitigates risks (e.g., fraudulent listings and money laundering) through real-time AI anomaly detection and on-chain enforcement. Our evaluation and analysis suggest that combining AI governance with multi-agent systems and blockchain can significantly bolster trust in tokenized asset ecosystems. This work offers a novel framework for trustworthy asset tokenization on the web and provides insights for practitioners aiming to deploy secure, compliant tokenization platforms.</description>

      <title>Towards transparent and data-driven fault detection in manufacturing: A case study on univariate, discrete time series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring consistent product quality in modern manufacturing is crucial, particularly in safety-critical applications. Conventional quality control approaches, reliant on manually defined thresholds and features, lack adaptability to the complexity and variability inherent in production data and necessitate extensive domain expertise. Conversely, data-driven methods, such as machine learning, demonstrate high detection performance but typically function as black-box models, thereby limiting their acceptance in industrial environments where interpretability is paramount. This paper introduces a methodology for industrial fault detection, which is both data-driven and transparent. The approach integrates a supervised machine learning model for multi-class fault classification, Shapley Additive Explanations for post-hoc interpretability, and a do-main-specific visualisation technique that maps model explanations to operator-interpretable features. Furthermore, the study proposes an evaluation methodology that assesses model explanations through quantitative perturbation analysis and evaluates visualisations by qualitative expert assessment. The approach was applied to the crimping process, a safety-critical joining technique, using a dataset of univariate, discrete time series. The system achieves a fault detection accuracy of 95.9 %, and both quantitative selectivity analysis and qualitative expert evaluations confirmed the relevance and inter-pretability of the generated explanations. This human-centric approach is designed to enhance trust and interpretability in data-driven fault detection, thereby contributing to applied system design in industrial quality control.</description>

      <title>Teaching Programming in the Age of Generative AI: Insights from Literature, Pedagogical Proposals, and Student Perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer programming is undergoing a true transformation driven by powerful new tools for automatic source code generation based on large language models. This transformation is also manifesting in introductory programming courses at universities around the world, generating an in-depth debate about how programming content should be taught, learned, and assessed in the context of generative artificial intelligence.
  This article aims, on the one hand, to review the most relevant studies on this issue, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages identified in the specialized literature. On the other hand, it proposes enriching teaching and learning methodologies by focusing on code comprehension and execution rather than on mere coding or program functionality. In particular, it advocates for the use of visual representations of code and visual simulations of its execution as effective tools for teaching, learning, and assessing programming, thus fostering a deeper understanding among students.
  Finally, the opinions of students who took the object-oriented programming course are presented to provide preliminary context supporting the incorporation of visual simulations in Java (or other languages) as part of the training process.</description>

      <title>AI-Hybrid TRNG: Kernel-Based Deep Learning for Near-Uniform Entropy Harvesting from Physical Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-Hybrid TRNG is a deep-learning framework that extracts near-uniform entropy directly from physical noise, eliminating the need for bulky quantum devices or expensive laboratory-grade RF receivers. Instead, it relies on a low-cost, thumb-sized RF front end, plus CPU-timing jitter, for training, and then emits 32-bit high-entropy streams without any quantization step.
  Unlike deterministic or trained artificial intelligence random number generators (RNGs), our dynamic inner-outer network couples adaptive natural sources and reseeding, yielding truly unpredictable and autonomous sequences. Generated numbers pass the NIST SP 800-22 battery better than a CPU-based method. It also passes nineteen bespoke statistical tests for both bit- and integer-level analysis. All results satisfy cryptographic standards, while forward and backward prediction experiments reveal no exploitable biases. The model's footprint is below 0.5 MB, making it deployable on MCUs and FPGA soft cores, as well as suitable for other resource-constrained platforms.
  By detaching randomness quality from dedicated hardware, AI-Hybrid TRNG broadens the reach of high-integrity random number generators across secure systems, cryptographic protocols, embedded and edge devices, stochastic simulations, and server applications that need randomness.</description>

      <title>Designing an Adaptive Storytelling Platform to Promote Civic Education in Politically Polarized Learning Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Political polarization undermines democratic civic education by exacerbating identity-based resistance to opposing viewpoints. Emerging AI technologies offer new opportunities to advance interventions that reduce polarization and promote political open-mindedness. We examined novel design strategies that leverage adaptive and emotionally-responsive civic narratives that may sustain students' emotional engagement in stories, and in turn, promote perspective-taking toward members of political out-groups. Drawing on theories from political psychology and narratology, we investigate how affective computing techniques can support three storytelling mechanisms: transportation into a story world, identification with characters, and interaction with the storyteller. Using a design-based research (DBR) approach, we iteratively developed and refined an AI-mediated Digital Civic Storytelling (AI-DCS) platform. Our prototype integrates facial emotion recognition and attention tracking to assess users' affective and attentional states in real time. Narrative content is organized around pre-structured story outlines, with beat-by-beat language adaptation implemented via GPT-4, personalizing linguistic tone to sustain students' emotional engagement in stories that center political perspectives different from their own. Our work offers a foundation for AI-supported, emotionally-sensitive strategies that address affective polarization while preserving learner autonomy. We conclude with implications for civic education interventions, algorithmic literacy, and HCI challenges associated with AI dialogue management and affect-adaptive learning environments.</description>

      <title>Text-to-Level Diffusion Models With Various Text Encoders for Super Mario Bros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research shows how diffusion models can unconditionally generate tile-based game levels, but use of diffusion models for text-to-level generation is underexplored. There are practical considerations for creating a usable model: caption/level pairs are needed, as is a text embedding model, and a way of generating entire playable levels, rather than individual scenes. We present strategies to automatically assign descriptive captions to an existing level dataset, and train diffusion models using both pretrained text encoders and simple transformer models trained from scratch. Captions are automatically assigned to generated levels so that the degree of overlap between input and output captions can be compared. We also assess the diversity and playability of the resulting levels. Results are compared with an unconditional diffusion model and a generative adversarial network, as well as the text-to-level approaches Five-Dollar Model and MarioGPT. Notably, the best diffusion model uses a simple transformer model for text embedding, and takes less time to train than diffusion models employing more complex text encoders, indicating that reliance on larger language models is not necessary. We also present a GUI allowing designers to construct long levels from model-generated scenes.</description>

      <title>Multimodal, Multi-Disease Medical Imaging Foundation Model (MerMED-FM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current artificial intelligence models for medical imaging are predominantly single modality and single disease. Attempts to create multimodal and multi-disease models have resulted in inconsistent clinical accuracy. Furthermore, training these models typically requires large, labour-intensive, well-labelled datasets. We developed MerMED-FM, a state-of-the-art multimodal, multi-specialty foundation model trained using self-supervised learning and a memory module. MerMED-FM was trained on 3.3 million medical images from over ten specialties and seven modalities, including computed tomography (CT), chest X-rays (CXR), ultrasound (US), pathology patches, color fundus photography (CFP), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and dermatology images. MerMED-FM was evaluated across multiple diseases and compared against existing foundational models. Strong performance was achieved across all modalities, with AUROCs of 0.988 (OCT); 0.982 (pathology); 0.951 (US); 0.943 (CT); 0.931 (skin); 0.894 (CFP); 0.858 (CXR). MerMED-FM has the potential to be a highly adaptable, versatile, cross-specialty foundation model that enables robust medical imaging interpretation across diverse medical disciplines.</description>

      <title>Beyond Sensor Data: Foundation Models of Behavioral Data from Wearables Improve Health Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wearable devices record physiological and behavioral signals that can improve health predictions. While foundation models are increasingly used for such predictions, they have been primarily applied to low-level sensor data, despite behavioral data often being more informative due to their alignment with physiologically relevant timescales and quantities. We develop foundation models of such behavioral signals using over 2.5B hours of wearable data from 162K individuals, systematically optimizing architectures and tokenization strategies for this unique dataset. Evaluated on 57 health-related tasks, our model shows strong performance across diverse real-world applications including individual-level classification and time-varying health state prediction. The model excels in behavior-driven tasks like sleep prediction, and improves further when combined with representations of raw sensor data. These results underscore the importance of tailoring foundation model design to wearables and demonstrate the potential to enable new health applications.</description>

      <title>What Makes Local Updates Effective: The Role of Data Heterogeneity and Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis contributes to the theoretical understanding of local update algorithms, especially Local SGD, in distributed and federated optimization under realistic models of data heterogeneity. A central focus is on the bounded second-order heterogeneity assumption, which is shown to be both necessary and sufficient for local updates to outperform centralized or mini-batch methods in convex and non-convex settings. The thesis establishes tight upper and lower bounds in several regimes for various local update algorithms and characterizes the min-max complexity of multiple problem classes. At its core is a fine-grained consensus-error-based analysis framework that yields sharper finite-time convergence bounds under third-order smoothness and relaxed heterogeneity assumptions. The thesis also extends to online federated learning, providing fundamental regret bounds under both first-order and bandit feedback. Together, these results clarify when and why local updates offer provable advantages, and the thesis serves as a self-contained guide for analyzing Local SGD in heterogeneous environments.</description>

      <title>SurgiSR4K: A High-Resolution Endoscopic Video Dataset for Robotic-Assisted Minimally Invasive Procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution imaging is crucial for enhancing visual clarity and enabling precise computer-assisted guidance in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Despite the increasing adoption of 4K endoscopic systems, there remains a significant gap in publicly available native 4K datasets tailored specifically for robotic-assisted MIS. We introduce SurgiSR4K, the first publicly accessible surgical imaging and video dataset captured at a native 4K resolution, representing realistic conditions of robotic-assisted procedures. SurgiSR4K comprises diverse visual scenarios including specular reflections, tool occlusions, bleeding, and soft tissue deformations, meticulously designed to reflect common challenges faced during laparoscopic and robotic surgeries. This dataset opens up possibilities for a broad range of computer vision tasks that might benefit from high resolution data, such as super resolution (SR), smoke removal, surgical instrument detection, 3D tissue reconstruction, monocular depth estimation, instance segmentation, novel view synthesis, and vision-language model (VLM) development. SurgiSR4K provides a robust foundation for advancing research in high-resolution surgical imaging and fosters the development of intelligent imaging technologies aimed at enhancing performance, safety, and usability in image-guided robotic surgeries.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Reasoning-Infused Learning: Improving Classification with LLM-Generated Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard classification models often map inputs directly to labels without explicit reasoning, potentially limiting their performance, robustness, and interpretability. This paper introduces a novel two-stage approach to enhance text classification by leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-generated reasonings. In the first stage, we fine-tune a Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model (henceforth Llama-R-Gen) on a general-purpose reasoning dataset (syvai/reasoning-gen) to generate textual reasoning (R) given a question and its answer. In the second stage, this generally trained Llama-R-Gen is used offline to create an augmented training dataset for a downstream generative model. This downstream model, based on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, takes only the input text (Q) and is trained to output the generated reasoning (R) immediately followed by the predicted emotion (A). We demonstrate this methodology on the dair-ai/emotion dataset for emotion classification. Our experiments show that the generative model trained to output reasoning and the emotion (Classifier Q-&gt;RA) achieves a significant improvement of 8.7 percentage points in accuracy (for emotion prediction) compared to a baseline generative model trained solely to output the emotion (Classifier Q-&gt;A), highlighting the strong generalization capabilities of the reasoning generation and the benefit of explicit reasoning training. This work underscores the potential of LLM-generated reasonings for creating richer training datasets, thereby improving the performance of diverse downstream NLP tasks and providing explicit explanations.</description>

      <title>Discovering the underlying analytic structure within Standard Model constants using artificial intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a search for underlying analytic structures among the fundamental parameters of the Standard Model (SM) using symbolic regression and genetic programming. We identify the simplest analytic relationships connecting pairs of these constants and report several notable observations based on about a thousand expressions with relative precision better than 1%. These results may serve as valuable inputs for model builders and artificial intelligence methods aimed at uncovering hidden patterns among the SM constants, or potentially used as building blocks for a deeper underlying law that connects all parameters of the SM through a small set of fundamental constants.</description>

      <title>Investigating Stochastic Methods for Prosody Modeling in Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While generative methods have progressed rapidly in recent years, generating expressive prosody for an utterance remains a challenging task in text-to-speech synthesis. This is particularly true for systems that model prosody explicitly through parameters such as pitch, energy, and duration, which is commonly done for the sake of interpretability and controllability. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of stochastic methods for this task, including Normalizing Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Rectified Flows. We compare these methods to a traditional deterministic baseline, as well as to real human realizations. Our extensive subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that stochastic methods produce natural prosody on par with human speakers by capturing the variability inherent in human speech. Further, they open up additional controllability options by allowing the sampling temperature to be tuned.</description>

      <title>A High-Fidelity Speech Super Resolution Network using a Complex Global Attention Module with Spectro-Temporal Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech super-resolution (SSR) enhances low-resolution speech by increasing the sampling rate. While most SSR methods focus on magnitude reconstruction, recent research highlights the importance of phase reconstruction for improved perceptual quality. Therefore, we introduce CTFT-Net, a Complex Time-Frequency Transformation Network that reconstructs both magnitude and phase in complex domains for improved SSR tasks. It incorporates a complex global attention block to model inter-phoneme and inter-frequency dependencies and a complex conformer to capture long-range and local features, improving frequency reconstruction and noise robustness. CTFT-Net employs time-domain and multi-resolution frequency-domain loss functions for better generalization. Experiments show CTFT-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models (NU-Wave, WSRGlow, NVSR, AERO) on the VCTK dataset, particularly for extreme upsampling (2 kHz to 48 kHz), reconstructing high frequencies effectively without noisy artifacts.</description>

      <title>Interpretable AI for Time-Series: Multi-Model Heatmap Fusion with Global Attention and NLP-Generated Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing model interpretability by integrating heatmaps produced separately by ResNet and a restructured 2D Transformer with globally weighted input saliency. We address the critical problem of spatial-temporal misalignment in existing interpretability methods, where convolutional networks fail to capture global context and Transformers lack localized precision - a limitation that impedes actionable insights in safety-critical domains like healthcare and industrial monitoring. Our method merges gradient-weighted activation maps (ResNet) and Transformer attention rollout into a unified visualization, achieving full spatial-temporal alignment while preserving real-time performance. Empirical evaluations on clinical (ECG arrhythmia detection) and industrial (energy consumption prediction) datasets demonstrate significant improvements: the hybrid framework achieves 94.1% accuracy (F1 0.93) on the PhysioNet dataset and reduces regression error to RMSE = 0.28 kWh (R2 = 0.95) on the UCI Energy Appliance dataset-outperforming standalone ResNet, Transformer, and InceptionTime baselines by 3.8-12.4%. An NLP module translates fused heatmaps into domain-specific narratives (e.g., "Elevated ST-segment between 2-4 seconds suggests myocardial ischemia"), validated via BLEU-4 (0.586) and ROUGE-L (0.650) scores. By formalizing interpretability as causal fidelity and spatial-temporal alignment, our approach bridges the gap between technical outputs and stakeholder understanding, offering a scalable solution for transparent, time-aware decision-making.</description>

      <title>Linearly Decoding Refused Knowledge in Aligned Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most commonly used language models (LMs) are instruction-tuned and aligned using a combination of fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, causing them to refuse users requests deemed harmful by the model. However, jailbreak prompts can often bypass these refusal mechanisms and elicit harmful responses. In this work, we study the extent to which information accessed via jailbreak prompts is decodable using linear probes trained on LM hidden states. We show that a great deal of initially refused information is linearly decodable. For example, across models, the response of a jailbroken LM for the average IQ of a country can be predicted by a linear probe with Pearson correlations exceeding $0.8$. Surprisingly, we find that probes trained on base models (which do not refuse) sometimes transfer to their instruction-tuned versions and are capable of revealing information that jailbreaks decode generatively, suggesting that the internal representations of many refused properties persist from base LMs through instruction-tuning. Importantly, we show that this information is not merely "leftover" in instruction-tuned models, but is actively used by them: we find that probe-predicted values correlate with LM generated pairwise comparisons, indicating that the information decoded by our probes align with suppressed generative behavior that may be expressed more subtly in other downstream tasks. Overall, our results suggest that instruction-tuning does not wholly eliminate or even relocate harmful information in representation space-they merely suppress its direct expression, leaving it both linearly accessible and indirectly influential in downstream behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time sign language recognition using lightweight DNNs trained on limited data. Our system addresses key challenges in sign language recognition, including data scarcity, high computational costs, and discrepancies in frame rates between training and inference environments. By encoding sign language specific parameters, such as handshape, palm orientation, movement, and location into vectorized inputs, and leveraging MediaPipe for landmark extraction, we achieve highly separable input data representations. Our DNN architecture, optimized for sub 10MB deployment, enables accurate classification of 343 signs with less than 10ms latency on edge devices. The data annotation platform 'slait data' facilitates structured labeling and vector extraction. Our model achieved 92% accuracy in isolated sign recognition and has been integrated into the 'slait ai' web application, where it demonstrates stable inference.</description>

      <title>Gym4ReaL: A Suite for Benchmarking Real-World Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, \emph{Reinforcement Learning} (RL) has made remarkable progress, achieving superhuman performance in a wide range of simulated environments. As research moves toward deploying RL in real-world applications, the field faces a new set of challenges inherent to real-world settings, such as large state-action spaces, non-stationarity, and partial observability. Despite their importance, these challenges are often underexplored in current benchmarks, which tend to focus on idealized, fully observable, and stationary environments, often neglecting to incorporate real-world complexities explicitly. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{Gym4ReaL}, a comprehensive suite of realistic environments designed to support the development and evaluation of RL algorithms that can operate in real-world scenarios. The suite includes a diverse set of tasks that expose algorithms to a variety of practical challenges. Our experimental results show that, in these settings, standard RL algorithms confirm their competitiveness against rule-based benchmarks, motivating the development of new methods to fully exploit the potential of RL to tackle the complexities of real-world tasks.</description>

      <title>Impact of Fine-Tuning Methods on Memorization in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the "pre-train and fine-tune" paradigm has become increasingly mainstream, leading to the development of various fine-tuning methods. However, the privacy risks arising from memorization during fine-tuning have received relatively little attention. To address this gap, we categorize popular fine-tuning approaches and assess their impact on memorization through the lens of membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our results show that, compared to parameter-based fine-tuning, prompt-based fine-tuning achieves competitive performance while exhibiting lower vulnerability to MIAs. Furthermore, prompt-based methods maintain low memorization regardless of model scale. These findings suggest that parameter-based fine-tuning is more prone to leaking private information, whereas prompt-based fine-tuning serves as a more privacy-preserving option.</description>

      <title>Control-Optimized Deep Reinforcement Learning for Artificially Intelligent Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a powerful tool for complex decision-making in machine learning and AI. However, traditional methods often assume perfect action execution, overlooking the uncertainties and deviations between an agent's selected actions and the actual system response. In real-world applications, such as robotics, mechatronics, and communication networks, execution mismatches arising from system dynamics, hardware constraints, and latency can significantly degrade performance. This work advances AI by developing a novel control-optimized DRL framework that explicitly models and compensates for action execution mismatches, a challenge largely overlooked in existing methods. Our approach establishes a structured two-stage process: determining the desired action and selecting the appropriate control signal to ensure proper execution. It trains the agent while accounting for action mismatches and controller corrections. By incorporating these factors into the training process, the AI agent optimizes the desired action with respect to both the actual control signal and the intended outcome, explicitly considering execution errors. This approach enhances robustness, ensuring that decision-making remains effective under real-world uncertainties. Our approach offers a substantial advancement for engineering practice by bridging the gap between idealized learning and real-world implementation. It equips intelligent agents operating in engineering environments with the ability to anticipate and adjust for actuation errors and system disturbances during training. We evaluate the framework in five widely used open-source mechanical simulation environments we restructured and developed to reflect real-world operating conditions, showcasing its robustness against uncertainties and offering a highly practical and efficient solution for control-oriented applications.</description>

      <title>Feature Integration Spaces: Joint Training Reveals Dual Encoding in Neural Network Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current sparse autoencoder (SAE) approaches to neural network interpretability assume that activations can be decomposed through linear superposition into sparse, interpretable features. Despite high reconstruction fidelity, SAEs consistently fail to eliminate polysemanticity and exhibit pathological behavioral errors. We propose that neural networks encode information in two complementary spaces compressed into the same substrate: feature identity and feature integration. To test this dual encoding hypothesis, we develop sequential and joint-training architectures to capture identity and integration patterns simultaneously. Joint training achieves 41.3% reconstruction improvement and 51.6% reduction in KL divergence errors. This architecture spontaneously develops bimodal feature organization: low squared norm features contributing to integration pathways and the rest contributing directly to the residual. Small nonlinear components (3% of parameters) achieve 16.5% standalone improvements, demonstrating parameter-efficient capture of computational relationships crucial for behavior. Additionally, intervention experiments using 2x2 factorial stimulus designs demonstrated that integration features exhibit selective sensitivity to experimental manipulations and produce systematic behavioral effects on model outputs, including significant interaction effects across semantic dimensions. This work provides systematic evidence for (1) dual encoding in neural representations, (2) meaningful nonlinearly encoded feature interactions, and (3) introduces an architectural paradigm shift from post-hoc feature analysis to integrated computational design, establishing foundations for next-generation SAEs.</description>

      <title>Double Q-learning for Value-based Deep Reinforcement Learning, Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overestimation is pervasive in reinforcement learning (RL), including in Q-learning, which forms the algorithmic basis for many value-based deep RL algorithms. Double Q-learning is an algorithm introduced to address Q-learning's overestimation by training two Q-functions and using both to de-correlate action-selection and action-evaluation in bootstrap targets. Shortly after Q-learning was adapted to deep RL in the form of deep Q-networks (DQN), Double Q-learning was adapted to deep RL in the form of Double DQN. However, Double DQN only loosely adapts Double Q-learning, forgoing the training of two different Q-functions that bootstrap off one another. In this paper, we study algorithms that adapt this core idea of Double Q-learning for value-based deep RL. We term such algorithms Deep Double Q-learning (DDQL). Our aim is to understand whether DDQL exhibits less overestimation than Double DQN and whether performant instantiations of DDQL exist. We answer both questions affirmatively, demonstrating that DDQL reduces overestimation and outperforms Double DQN in aggregate across 57 Atari 2600 games, without requiring additional hyperparameters. We also study several aspects of DDQL, including its network architecture, replay ratio, and minibatch sampling strategy.</description>

      <title>Visual Privacy Management with Generative AI for Blind and Low-Vision People</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blind and low vision (BLV) individuals use Generative AI (GenAI) tools to interpret and manage visual content in their daily lives. While such tools can enhance the accessibility of visual content and so enable greater user independence, they also introduce complex challenges around visual privacy. In this paper, we investigate the current practices and future design preferences of blind and low vision individuals through an interview study with 21 participants. Our findings reveal a range of current practices with GenAI that balance privacy, efficiency, and emotional agency, with users accounting for privacy risks across six key scenarios, such as self-presentation, indoor/outdoor spatial privacy, social sharing, and handling professional content. Our findings reveal design preferences, including on-device processing, zero-retention guarantees, sensitive content redaction, privacy-aware appearance indicators, and multimodal tactile mirrored interaction methods. We conclude with actionable design recommendations to support user-centered visual privacy through GenAI, expanding the notion of privacy and responsible handling of others data.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Multiview Xray Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate interpretation of multi-view radiographs is crucial for diagnosing fractures, muscular injuries, and other anomalies. While significant advances have been made in AI-based analysis of single images, current methods often struggle to establish robust correspondences between different X-ray views, an essential capability for precise clinical evaluations. In this work, we present a novel self-supervised pipeline that eliminates the need for manual annotation by automatically generating a many-to-many correspondence matrix between synthetic X-ray views. This is achieved using digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR), which are automatically derived from unannotated CT volumes. Our approach incorporates a transformer-based training phase to accurately predict correspondences across two or more X-ray views. Furthermore, we demonstrate that learning correspondences among synthetic X-ray views can be leveraged as a pretraining strategy to enhance automatic multi-view fracture detection on real data. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real X-ray datasets show that incorporating correspondences improves performance in multi-view fracture classification.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguring Digital Accountability: AI-Powered Innovations and Transnational Governance in a Postnational Accounting Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores how AI-powered digital innovations are reshaping organisational accountability in a transnational governance context. As AI systems increasingly mediate decision-making in domains such as auditing and financial reporting, traditional mechanisms of accountability, based on control, transparency, and auditability, are being destabilised. We integrate the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Actor-Network Theory (ANT), and institutional theory to examine how organisations adopt AI technologies in response to regulatory, ethical, and cultural pressures that transcend national boundaries. We argue that accountability is co-constructed within global socio-technical networks, shaped not only by user perceptions but also by governance logics and normative expectations. Extending TAM, we incorporate compliance and legitimacy as key factors in perceived usefulness and usability. Drawing on ANT, we reconceptualise accountability as a relational and emergent property of networked assemblages. We propose two organisational strategies including internal governance reconfiguration and external actor-network engagement to foster responsible, legitimate, and globally accepted AI adoption in the accounting domain.</description>

      <title>Reducing Variability of Multiple Instance Learning Methods for Digital Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00292v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital pathology has revolutionized the field by enabling the digitization of tissue samples into whole slide images (WSIs). However, the high resolution and large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying Deep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller patches with a global label (\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a (too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution for WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high variability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15 AUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL methods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight initialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To address that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL methods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most stable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be applied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining computational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI classification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies and 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.</description>

      <title>Natural language processing for African languages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in word embeddings and language models use large-scale, unlabelled data and self-supervised learning to boost NLP performance. Multilingual models, often trained on web-sourced data like Wikipedia, face challenges: few low-resource languages are included, their data is often noisy, and lack of labeled datasets makes it hard to evaluate performance outside high-resource languages like English. In this dissertation, we focus on languages spoken in Sub-Saharan Africa where all the indigenous languages in this region can be regarded as low-resourced in terms of the availability of labelled data for NLP tasks and unlabelled data found on the web. We analyse the noise in the publicly available corpora, and curate a high-quality corpus, demonstrating that the quality of semantic representations learned in word embeddings does not only depend on the amount of data but on the quality of pre-training data. We demonstrate empirically the limitations of word embeddings, and the opportunities the multilingual pre-trained language model (PLM) offers especially for languages unseen during pre-training and low-resource scenarios. We further study how to adapt and specialize multilingual PLMs to unseen African languages using a small amount of monolingual texts. To address the under-representation of the African languages in NLP research, we developed large scale human-annotated labelled datasets for 21 African languages in two impactful NLP tasks: named entity recognition and machine translation. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation using state-of-the-art methods across supervised, weakly-supervised, and transfer learning settings.</description>

      <title>Open-ended Scientific Discovery via Bayesian Surprise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The promise of autonomous scientific discovery (ASD) hinges not only on answering questions, but also on knowing which questions to ask. Most recent works in ASD explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in goal-driven settings, relying on human-specified research questions to guide hypothesis generation. However, scientific discovery may be accelerated further by allowing the AI system to drive exploration by its own criteria. The few existing approaches in open-ended ASD select hypotheses based on diversity heuristics or subjective proxies for human interestingness, but the former struggles to meaningfully navigate the typically vast hypothesis space, and the latter suffers from imprecise definitions. This paper presents AutoDS -- a method for open-ended ASD that instead drives scientific exploration using Bayesian surprise. Here, we quantify the epistemic shift from the LLM's prior beliefs about a hypothesis to its posterior beliefs after gathering experimental results. To efficiently explore the space of nested hypotheses, our method employs a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) strategy with progressive widening using surprisal as the reward function. We evaluate AutoDS in the setting of data-driven discovery across 21 real-world datasets spanning domains such as biology, economics, finance, and behavioral science. Our results demonstrate that under a fixed budget, AutoDS substantially outperforms competitors by producing 5--29\% more discoveries deemed surprising by the LLM. Our human evaluation further finds that two-thirds of AutoDS discoveries are surprising to the domain experts, suggesting this is an important step forward towards building open-ended ASD systems.</description>

      <title>Failure by Interference: Language Models Make Balanced Parentheses Errors When Faulty Mechanisms Overshadow Sound Ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in coding capabilities, language models (LMs) still struggle with simple syntactic tasks such as generating balanced parentheses. In this study, we investigate the underlying mechanisms behind the persistence of these errors across LMs of varying sizes (124M-7B) to both understand and mitigate the errors. Our study reveals that LMs rely on a number of components (attention heads and FF neurons) that independently make their own predictions. While some components reliably promote correct answers across a generalized range of inputs (i.e., implementing "sound mechanisms''), others are less reliable and introduce noise by promoting incorrect tokens (i.e., implementing "faulty mechanisms''). Errors occur when the faulty mechanisms overshadow the sound ones and dominantly affect the predictions. Motivated by this insight, we introduce RASteer, a steering method to systematically identify and increase the contribution of reliable components for improving model performance. RASteer substantially improves performance on balanced parentheses tasks, boosting accuracy of some models from $0$% to around $100$% without impairing the models' general coding ability. We further demonstrate its broader applicability in arithmetic reasoning tasks, achieving performance gains of up to around $20$%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amodal segmentation and amodal content completion require using object priors to estimate occluded masks and features of objects in complex scenes. Until now, no data has provided an additional dimension for object context: the possibility of multiple cameras sharing a view of a scene. We introduce MOVi-MC-AC: Multiple Object Video with Multi-Cameras and Amodal Content, the largest amodal segmentation and first amodal content dataset to date. Cluttered scenes of generic household objects are simulated in multi-camera video. MOVi-MC-AC contributes to the growing literature of object detection, tracking, and segmentation by including two new contributions to the deep learning for computer vision world. Multiple Camera (MC) settings where objects can be identified and tracked between various unique camera perspectives are rare in both synthetic and real-world video. We introduce a new complexity to synthetic video by providing consistent object ids for detections and segmentations between both frames and multiple cameras each with unique features and motion patterns on a single scene. Amodal Content (AC) is a reconstructive task in which models predict the appearance of target objects through occlusions. In the amodal segmentation literature, some datasets have been released with amodal detection, tracking, and segmentation labels. While other methods rely on slow cut-and-paste schemes to generate amodal content pseudo-labels, they do not account for natural occlusions present in the modal masks. MOVi-MC-AC provides labels for ~5.8 million object instances, setting a new maximum in the amodal dataset literature, along with being the first to provide ground-truth amodal content. The full dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Amar-S/MOVi-MC-AC ,</description>

      <title>VTS-Guided AI Interaction Workflow for Business Insights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern firms face a flood of dense, unstructured reports. Turning these documents into usable insights takes heavy effort and is far from agile when quick answers are needed. VTS-AI tackles this gap. It integrates Visual Thinking Strategies, which emphasize evidence-based observation, linking, and thinking, into AI agents, so the agents can extract business insights from unstructured text, tables, and images at scale. The system works in three tiers (micro, meso, macro). It tags issues, links them to source pages, and rolls them into clear action levers stored in a searchable YAML file. In tests on an 18-page business report, VTS-AI matched the speed of a one-shot ChatGPT prompt yet produced richer findings: page locations, verbatim excerpts, severity scores, and causal links. Analysts can accept or adjust these outputs in the same IDE, keeping human judgment in the loop. Early results show VTS-AI spots the direction of key metrics and flags where deeper number-crunching is needed. Next steps include mapping narrative tags to financial ratios, adding finance-tuned language models through a Model-Context Protocol, and building a Risk &amp; Safety Layer to stress-test models and secure data. These upgrades aim to make VTS-AI a production-ready, audit-friendly tool for rapid business analysis.</description>

      <title>An AST-guided LLM Approach for SVRF Code Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard Verification Rule Format (SVRF) is essential for semiconductor applications like Design Rule Check (DRC), Layout Versus Schematic (LVS), and Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) and it faces challenges as advancing nodes create complex design rules that renders traditional SVRF development ineffective and highlight an expertise gap. This paper introduces a novel methodology integrating Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) embedding and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced SVRF code synthesis, ensuring semantic accuracy and error minimization through structural validation with domain-specific insights for precise code generation.
  We evaluate different T5-based models and propose an innovative SVRF-specific scoring framework that complements standard metrics like BLEU and ROUGE-L. In our approach, AST provides rigorous structural validation, while RAG infuses relevant domain knowledge, effectively enhancing the code generation workflow.
  Testing on a comprehensive benchmark of 740 DRC rule implementations, our methodology demonstrates up to a 40\% improvement in code generation accuracy compared to basic text-based fine-tuning process. This fusion of industry expertise with advanced coding strategies not only optimizes SVRF development under limited dataset constraints but also creates a more intuitive and efficient coding environment. Consequently, users can rapidly iterate through design cycles, reduce manual error correction, and significantly improve overall productivity.</description>

      <title>CGEarthEye:A High-Resolution Remote Sensing Vision Foundation Model Based on the Jilin-1 Satellite Constellation</title>

Abstract: Deep learning methods have significantly advanced the development of intelligent rinterpretation in remote sensing (RS), with foundational model research based on large-scale pre-training paradigms rapidly reshaping various domains of Earth Observation (EO). However, compared to the open accessibility and high spatiotemporal coverage of medium-resolution data, the limited acquisition channels for ultra-high-resolution optical RS imagery have constrained the progress of high-resolution remote sensing vision foundation models (RSVFM). As the world's largest sub-meter-level commercial RS satellite constellation, the Jilin-1 constellation possesses abundant sub-meter-level image resources. This study proposes CGEarthEye, a RSVFM framework specifically designed for Jilin-1 satellite characteristics, comprising five backbones with different parameter scales with totaling 2.1 billion parameters. To enhance the representational capacity of the foundation model, we developed JLSSD, the first 15-million-scale multi-temporal self-supervised learning (SSL) dataset featuring global coverage with quarterly temporal sampling within a single year, constructed through multi-level representation clustering and sampling strategies. The framework integrates seasonal contrast, augmentation-based contrast, and masked patch token contrastive strategies for pre-training. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 benchmark datasets covering four typical RS tasks demonstrate that the CGEarthEye consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Further analysis reveals CGEarthEye's superior characteristics in feature visualization, model convergence, parameter efficiency, and practical mapping applications. This study anticipates that the exceptional representation capabilities of CGEarthEye will facilitate broader and more efficient applications of Jilin-1 data in traditional EO application.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Exploration for a Class of Continuous-Time Linear--Quadratic Reinforcement Learning Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for the same class of continuous-time stochastic linear--quadratic (LQ) control problems as in \cite{huang2024sublinear}, where volatilities depend on both states and controls while states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent. We propose a model-free, data-driven exploration mechanism that adaptively adjusts entropy regularization by the critic and policy variance by the actor. Unlike the constant or deterministic exploration schedules employed in \cite{huang2024sublinear}, which require extensive tuning for implementations and ignore learning progresses during iterations, our adaptive exploratory approach boosts learning efficiency with minimal tuning. Despite its flexibility, our method achieves a sublinear regret bound that matches the best-known model-free results for this class of LQ problems, which were previously derived only with fixed exploration schedules. Numerical experiments demonstrate that adaptive explorations accelerate convergence and improve regret performance compared to the non-adaptive model-free and model-based counterparts.</description>

      <title>iPanda: An Intelligent Protocol Testing and Debugging Agent for Conformance Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformance testing is essential for ensuring that protocol implementations comply with their specifications. However, traditional testing approaches involve manually creating numerous test cases and scripts, making the process labor-intensive and inefficient. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive text comprehension and code generation abilities, providing promising opportunities for automation. In this paper, we propose iPanda, the first end-to-end framework that leverages LLMs to automate protocol conformance testing. Given a protocol specification document and its implementation, iPanda first employs a keyword-based method to automatically generate comprehensive test cases. Then, it utilizes a code-based retrieval-augmented generation approach to effectively interpret the implementation and produce executable test code. To further enhance code quality, iPanda incorporates an iterative self-correction mechanism to refine generated test scripts interactively. Finally, by executing and analyzing the generated tests, iPanda systematically verifies compliance between implementations and protocol specifications. Comprehensive experiments on various protocols show that iPanda significantly outperforms pure LLM-based approaches, improving the success rate (Pass@1) of test-code generation by factors ranging from 4.675 times to 10.751 times.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Molecular Graphs with Geometries via Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate molecular property predictions require 3D geometries, which are typically obtained using expensive methods such as density functional theory (DFT). Here, we attempt to obtain molecular geometries by relying solely on machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) models. To this end, we first curate a large-scale molecular relaxation dataset comprising 3.5 million molecules and 300 million snapshots. Then MLIP foundation models are trained with supervised learning to predict energy and forces given 3D molecular structures. Once trained, we show that the foundation models can be used in different ways to obtain geometries either explicitly or implicitly. First, it can be used to obtain low-energy 3D geometries via geometry optimization, providing relaxed 3D geometries for downstream molecular property predictions. To mitigate potential biases and enhance downstream predictions, we introduce geometry fine-tuning based on the relaxed 3D geometries. Second, the foundation models can be directly fine-tuned for property prediction when ground truth 3D geometries are available. Our results demonstrate that MLIP foundation models trained on relaxation data can provide valuable molecular geometries that benefit property predictions.</description>

      <title>Geological Everything Model 3D: A Promptable Foundation Model for Unified and Zero-Shot Subsurface Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding Earth's subsurface is critical for energy transition, natural hazard mitigation, and planetary science. Yet subsurface analysis remains fragmented, with separate models required for structural interpretation, stratigraphic analysis, geobody segmentation, and property modeling-each tightly coupled to specific data distributions and task formulations. We introduce the Geological Everything Model 3D (GEM), a unified generative architecture that reformulates all these tasks as prompt-conditioned inference along latent structural frameworks derived from subsurface imaging. This formulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference mechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs, masks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce geologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot generalization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining for new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage training process that combines self-supervised representation learning on large-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts and labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad applicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy analysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic stratigraphic interpretation, geobody delineation, and property modeling. By bridging expert knowledge with generative reasoning in a structurally aware manner, GEM lays the foundation for scalable, human-in-the-loop geophysical AI-transitioning from fragmented pipelines to a vertically integrated, promptable reasoning system.

      <title>RoboEval: Where Robotic Manipulation Meets Structured and Scalable Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present RoboEval, a simulation benchmark and structured evaluation framework designed to reveal the limitations of current bimanual manipulation policies. While prior benchmarks report only binary task success, we show that such metrics often conceal critical weaknesses in policy behavior -- such as poor coordination, slipping during grasping, or asymmetric arm usage. RoboEval introduces a suite of tiered, semantically grounded tasks decomposed into skill-specific stages, with variations that systematically challenge spatial, physical, and coordination capabilities. Tasks are paired with fine-grained diagnostic metrics and 3000+ human demonstrations to support imitation learning. Our experiments reveal that policies with similar success rates diverge in how tasks are executed -- some struggle with alignment, others with temporally consistent bimanual control. We find that behavioral metrics correlate with success in over half of task-metric pairs, and remain informative even when binary success saturates. By pinpointing when and how policies fail, RoboEval enables a deeper, more actionable understanding of robotic manipulation -- and highlights the need for evaluation tools that go beyond success alone.</description>

      <title>A Recipe for Causal Graph Regression: Confounding Effects Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through recognizing causal subgraphs, causal graph learning (CGL) has risen to be a promising approach for improving the generalizability of graph neural networks under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. However, the empirical successes of CGL techniques are mostly exemplified in classification settings, while regression tasks, a more challenging setting in graph learning, are overlooked. We thus devote this work to tackling causal graph regression (CGR); to this end we reshape the processing of confounding effects in existing CGL studies, which mainly deal with classification. Specifically, we reflect on the predictive power of confounders in graph-level regression, and generalize classification-specific causal intervention techniques to regression through a lens of contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on graph OOD benchmarks validate the efficacy of our proposals for CGR. The model implementation and the code are provided on https://github.com/causal-graph/CGR.</description>

      <title>Novel Pigeon-inspired 3D Obstacle Detection and Avoidance Maneuver for Multi-UAV Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in multi-agent systems manipulation have demonstrated a rising demand for the implementation of multi-UAV systems in urban areas, which are always subjected to the presence of static and dynamic obstacles. Inspired by the collective behavior of tilapia fish and pigeons, the focus of the presented research is on the introduction of a nature-inspired collision-free formation control for a multi-UAV system, considering the obstacle avoidance maneuvers. The developed framework in this study utilizes a semi-distributed control approach, in which, based on a probabilistic Lloyd's algorithm, a centralized guidance algorithm works for optimal positioning of the UAVs, while a distributed control approach has been used for the intervehicle collision and obstacle avoidance. Further, the presented framework has been extended to the 3D space with a novel definition of 3D maneuvers. Finally, the presented framework has been applied to multi-UAV systems in 2D and 3D scenarios, and the obtained results demonstrated the validity of the presented method in dynamic environments with stationary and moving obstacles.</description>

      <title>Iterative Distillation for Reward-Guided Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models in Biomolecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of fine-tuning diffusion models for reward-guided generation in biomolecular design. While diffusion models have proven highly effective in modeling complex, high-dimensional data distributions, real-world applications often demand more than high-fidelity generation, requiring optimization with respect to potentially non-differentiable reward functions such as physics-based simulation or rewards based on scientific knowledge. Although RL methods have been explored to fine-tune diffusion models for such objectives, they often suffer from instability, low sample efficiency, and mode collapse due to their on-policy nature. In this work, we propose an iterative distillation-based fine-tuning framework that enables diffusion models to optimize for arbitrary reward functions. Our method casts the problem as policy distillation: it collects off-policy data during the roll-in phase, simulates reward-based soft-optimal policies during roll-out, and updates the model by minimizing the KL divergence between the simulated soft-optimal policy and the current model policy. Our off-policy formulation, combined with KL divergence minimization, enhances training stability and sample efficiency compared to existing RL-based methods. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and superior reward optimization of our approach across diverse tasks in protein, small molecule, and regulatory DNA design.</description>

      <title>Best Agent Identification for General Game Playing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient and generalised procedure to accurately identify the best performing algorithm for each sub-task in a multi-problem domain. Our approach treats this as a set of best arm identification problems for multi-armed bandits, where each bandit corresponds to a specific task and each arm corresponds to a specific algorithm or agent. We propose an optimistic selection process based on the Wilson score interval (Optimistic-WS) that ranks each arm across all bandits in terms of their potential regret reduction. We evaluate the performance of Optimistic-WS on two of the most popular general game domains, the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework and the Ludii general game playing system, with the goal of identifying the highest performing agent for each game within a limited number of trials. Compared to previous best arm identification algorithms for multi-armed bandits, our results demonstrate a substantial performance improvement in terms of average simple regret. This novel approach can be used to significantly improve the quality and accuracy of agent evaluation procedures for general game frameworks, as well as other multi-task domains with high algorithm runtimes.</description>

      <title>ATSTrack: Enhancing Visual-Language Tracking by Aligning Temporal and Spatial Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A main challenge of Visual-Language Tracking (VLT) is the misalignment between visual inputs and language descriptions caused by target movement. Previous trackers have explored many effective feature modification methods to preserve more aligned features. However, an important yet unexplored factor ultimately hinders their capability, which is the inherent differences in the temporal and spatial scale of information between visual and language inputs. To address this issue, we propose a novel visual-language tracker that enhances the effect of feature modification by \textbf{A}ligning \textbf{T}emporal and \textbf{S}patial scale of different input components, named as \textbf{ATSTrack}. Specifically, we decompose each language description into phrases with different attributes based on their temporal and spatial correspondence with visual inputs, and modify their features in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, we introduce a Visual-Language token that comprises modified linguistic information from the previous frame to guide the model to extract visual features that are more relevant to language description, thereby reducing the impact caused by the differences in spatial scale. Experimental results show that our proposed ATSTrack achieves performance comparable to existing methods. Our code will be released.</description>

      <title>Process-aware and high-fidelity microstructure generation using stable diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthesizing realistic microstructure images conditioned on processing parameters is crucial for understanding process-structure relationships in materials design. However, this task remains challenging due to limited training micrographs and the continuous nature of processing variables. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel process-aware generative modeling approach based on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (SD3.5-Large), a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model adapted for microstructure generation. Our method introduces numeric-aware embeddings that encode continuous variables (annealing temperature, time, and magnification) directly into the model's conditioning, enabling controlled image generation under specified process conditions and capturing process-driven microstructural variations. To address data scarcity and computational constraints, we fine-tune only a small fraction of the model's weights via DreamBooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently transferring the pre-trained model to the materials domain. We validate realism using a semantic segmentation model based on a fine-tuned U-Net with a VGG16 encoder on 24 labeled micrographs. It achieves 97.1% accuracy and 85.7% mean IoU, outperforming previous methods. Quantitative analyses using physical descriptors and spatial statistics show strong agreement between synthetic and real microstructures. Specifically, two-point correlation and lineal-path errors remain below 2.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Our method represents the first adaptation of SD3.5-Large for process-aware microstructure generation, offering a scalable approach for data-driven materials design.</description>

Abstract: This research paper introduces two novel complex-valued Hopfield neural networks (CvHNNs) that incorporate phase and magnitude quantization. The first CvHNN employs a ceiling-type activation function that operates on the rectangular coordinate representation of the complex net contribution. The second CvHNN similarly incorporates phase and magnitude quantization but utilizes a ceiling-type activation function based on the polar coordinate representation of the complex net contribution. The proposed CvHNNs, with their phase and magnitude quantization, significantly increase the number of states compared to existing models in the literature, thereby expanding the range of potential applications for CvHNNs.</description>

      <title>Diversity Conscious Refined Random Forest</title>

Abstract: Random Forest (RF) is a widely used ensemble learning technique known for its robust classification performance across diverse domains. However, it often relies on hundreds of trees and all input features, leading to high inference cost and model redundancy. In this work, our goal is to grow trees dynamically only on informative features and then enforce maximal diversity by clustering and retaining uncorrelated trees. Therefore, we propose a Refined Random Forest Classifier that iteratively refines itself by first removing the least informative features and then analytically determines how many new trees should be grown, followed by correlation-based clustering to remove redundant trees. The classification accuracy of our model was compared against the standard RF on the same number of trees. Experiments on 8 multiple benchmark datasets, including binary and multiclass datasets, demonstrate that the proposed model achieves improved accuracy compared to standard RF.</description>

      <title>Physics-Aware Style Transfer for Adaptive Holographic Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inline holographic imaging presents an ill-posed inverse problem of reconstructing objects' complex amplitude from recorded diffraction patterns. Although recent deep learning approaches have shown promise over classical phase retrieval algorithms, they often require high-quality ground truth datasets of complex amplitude maps to achieve a statistical inverse mapping operation between the two domains. Here, we present a physics-aware style transfer approach that interprets the object-to-sensor distance as an implicit style within diffraction patterns. Using the style domain as the intermediate domain to construct cyclic image translation, we show that the inverse mapping operation can be learned in an adaptive manner only with datasets composed of intensity measurements. We further demonstrate its biomedical applicability by reconstructing the morphology of dynamically flowing red blood cells, highlighting its potential for real-time, label-free imaging. As a framework that leverages physical cues inherently embedded in measurements, the presented method offers a practical learning strategy for imaging applications where ground truth is difficult or impossible to obtain.</description>

      <title>PNAct: Crafting Backdoor Attacks in Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is widely used in tasks where agents interact with an environment to maximize rewards. Building on this foundation, Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) incorporates a cost metric alongside the reward metric, ensuring that agents adhere to safety constraints during decision-making. In this paper, we identify that Safe RL is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which can manipulate agents into performing unsafe actions. First, we introduce the relevant concepts and evaluation metrics for backdoor attacks in Safe RL. It is the first attack framework in the Safe RL field that involves both Positive and Negative Action sample (PNAct) is to implant backdoors, where positive action samples provide reference actions and negative action samples indicate actions to be avoided. We theoretically point out the properties of PNAct and design an attack algorithm. Finally, we conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed backdoor attack framework, evaluating it with the established metrics. This paper highlights the potential risks associated with Safe RL and underscores the feasibility of such attacks. Our code and supplementary material are available at https://github.com/azure-123/PNAct.</description>

      <title>Twill: Scheduling Compound AI Systems on Heterogeneous Mobile Edge Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compound AI (cAI) systems chain multiple AI models to solve complex problems. cAI systems are typically composed of deep neural networks (DNNs), transformers, and large language models (LLMs), exhibiting a high degree of computational diversity and dynamic workload variation. Deploying cAI services on mobile edge platforms poses a significant challenge in scheduling concurrent DNN-transformer inference tasks, which arrive dynamically in an unknown sequence. Existing mobile edge AI inference strategies manage multi-DNN or transformer-only workloads, relying on design-time profiling, and cannot handle concurrent inference of DNNs and transformers required by cAI systems. In this work, we address the challenge of scheduling cAI systems on heterogeneous mobile edge platforms. We present Twill, a run-time framework to handle concurrent inference requests of cAI workloads through task affinity-aware cluster mapping and migration, priority-aware task freezing/unfreezing, and DVFS, while minimizing inference latency within power budgets. We implement and deploy our Twill framework on the Nvidia Jetson Orin NX platform. We evaluate Twill against state-of-the-art edge AI inference techniques over contemporary DNNs and LLMs, reducing inference latency by 54% on average, while honoring power budgets.</description>

      <title>Visual Anagrams Reveal Hidden Differences in Holistic Shape Processing Across Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans are able to recognize objects based on both local texture cues and the configuration of object parts, yet contemporary vision models primarily harvest local texture cues, yielding brittle, non-compositional features. Work on shape-vs-texture bias has pitted shape and texture representations in opposition, measuring shape relative to texture, ignoring the possibility that models (and humans) can simultaneously rely on both types of cues, and obscuring the absolute quality of both types of representation. We therefore recast shape evaluation as a matter of absolute configural competence, operationalized by the Configural Shape Score (CSS), which (i) measures the ability to recognize both images in Object-Anagram pairs that preserve local texture while permuting global part arrangement to depict different object categories. Across 86 convolutional, transformer, and hybrid models, CSS (ii) uncovers a broad spectrum of configural sensitivity with fully self-supervised and language-aligned transformers -- exemplified by DINOv2, SigLIP2 and EVA-CLIP -- occupying the top end of the CSS spectrum. Mechanistic probes reveal that (iii) high-CSS networks depend on long-range interactions: radius-controlled attention masks abolish performance showing a distinctive U-shaped integration profile, and representational-similarity analyses expose a mid-depth transition from local to global coding. A BagNet control remains at chance (iv), ruling out "border-hacking" strategies. Finally, (v) we show that configural shape score also predicts other shape-dependent evals. Overall, we propose that the path toward truly robust, generalizable, and human-like vision systems may not lie in forcing an artificial choice between shape and texture, but rather in architectural and learning frameworks that seamlessly integrate both local-texture and global configural shape.</description>

      <title>TeamCMU at Touch\'e: Adversarial Co-Evolution for Advertisement Integration and Detection in Conversational Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As conversational search engines increasingly adopt generation-based paradigms powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the integration of advertisements into generated responses presents both commercial opportunities and challenges for user experience. Unlike traditional search, where advertisements are clearly delineated, generative systems blur the boundary between informational content and promotional material, raising concerns around transparency and trust. In this work, we propose a modular pipeline for advertisement management in RAG-based conversational systems, consisting of an ad-rewriter for seamless ad integration and a robust ad-classifier for detection. We leverage synthetic data to train high-performing classifiers, which are then used to guide two complementary ad-integration strategies: supervised fine-tuning of the ad-rewriter and a best-of-N sampling approach that selects the least detectable ad-integrated response among multiple candidates. Our evaluation focuses on two core questions: the effectiveness of ad classifiers in detecting diverse ad integration strategies, and the training methods that best support coherent, minimally intrusive ad insertion. Experimental results show that our ad-classifier, trained on synthetic advertisement data inspired by marketing strategies and enhanced through curriculum learning, achieves robust detection performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that classifier-guided optimization, through both fine-tuning and best-of-N sampling, significantly improves ad stealth, enabling more seamless integration. These findings contribute an adversarial co-evolution framework for developing more sophisticated ad-aware generative search systems and robust ad classifiers.</description>

Abstract: The integration of various AI tools creates a complex socio-technical environment where employee-customer interactions form the core of work practices. This study investigates how customer service representatives (CSRs) at the power grid service customer service call center perceive AI assistance in their interactions with customers. Through a field visit and semi-structured interviews with 13 CSRs, we found that AI can alleviate some traditional burdens during the call (e.g., typing and memorizing) but also introduces new burdens (e.g., earning, compliance, psychological burdens). This research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of AI integration in organizational settings and highlights the efforts and burdens undertaken by CSRs to adapt to the updated system.</description>

      <title>Box-QAymo: Box-Referring VQA Dataset for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpretable communication is essential for safe and trustworthy autonomous driving, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often operate under idealized assumptions and struggle to capture user intent in real-world scenarios. Existing driving-oriented VQA datasets are limited to full-scene descriptions or waypoint prediction, preventing the assessment of whether VLMs can respond to localized user-driven queries. We introduce Box-QAymo, a box-referring dataset and benchmark designed to both evaluate and finetune VLMs on spatial and temporal reasoning over user-specified objects. Users express intent by drawing bounding boxes, offering a fast and intuitive interface for focused queries in complex scenes. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical evaluation protocol that begins with binary sanity-check questions to assess basic model capacities, and progresses to (1) attribute prediction for box-referred objects, (2) motion understanding of target instances, and (3) spatiotemporal motion reasoning over inter-object dynamics across frames. To support this, we crowd-sourced fine-grained object classes and visual attributes that reflect the complexity drivers encounter, and extract object trajectories to construct temporally grounded QA pairs. Rigorous quality control through negative sampling, temporal consistency checks, and difficulty-aware balancing guarantee dataset robustness and diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals significant limitations in current VLMs when queried about perception questions, highlighting the gap in achieving real-world performance. This work provides a foundation for developing more robust and interpretable autonomous driving systems that can communicate effectively with users under real-world conditions.

      <title>Rethinking Group Recommender Systems in the Era of Generative AI: From One-Shot Recommendations to Agentic Group Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than twenty-five years ago, first ideas were developed on how to design a system that can provide recommendations to groups of users instead of individual users. Since then, a rich variety of algorithmic proposals were published, e.g., on how to acquire individual preferences, how to aggregate them, and how to generate recommendations for groups of users. However, despite the rich literature on the topic, barely any examples of real-world group recommender systems can be found. This lets us question common assumptions in academic research, in particular regarding communication processes in a group and how recommendation-supported decisions are made. In this essay, we argue that these common assumptions and corresponding system designs often may not match the needs or expectations of users. We thus call for a reorientation in this research area, leveraging the capabilities of modern Generative AI assistants like ChatGPT. Specifically, as one promising future direction, we envision group recommender systems to be systems where human group members interact in a chat and an AI-based group recommendation agent assists the decision-making process in an agentic way. Ultimately, this shall lead to a more natural group decision-making environment and finally to wider adoption of group recommendation systems in practice.</description>

      <title>Not All Attention Heads Are What You Need: Refining CLIP's Image Representation with Attention Ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the role of attention heads in CLIP's image encoder. While CLIP has exhibited robust performance across diverse applications, we hypothesize that certain attention heads negatively affect final representations and that ablating them can improve performance in downstream tasks. To capitalize on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective method, called Attention Ablation Technique (AAT), to suppress the contribution of specific heads by manipulating attention weights. By integrating two alternative strategies tailored for different application scenarios, AAT systematically identifies and ablates detrimental attention heads to enhance representation quality. Experiments demonstrate that AAT consistently improves downstream task performance across various domains, boosting recall rate by up to 11.1% on CLIP-family models for cross-modal retrieval. The results highlight the potential of AAT to effectively refine large-scale vision-language models with virtually no increase in inference cost.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design in Nanophotonics via Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse design in nanophotonics, the computational discovery of structures achieving targeted electromagnetic (EM) responses, has become a key tool for recent optical advances. Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization methods struggle with the inherently high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces and the substantial computational demands of EM simulations. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged to address these bottlenecks effectively. This review frames ML-enhanced inverse design methodologies through the lens of representation learning, classifying them into two categories: output-side and input-side approaches. Output-side methods use ML to learn a representation in the solution space to create a differentiable solver that accelerates optimization. Conversely, input-side techniques employ ML to learn compact, latent-space representations of feasible device geometries, enabling efficient global exploration through generative models. Each strategy presents unique trade-offs in data requirements, generalization capacity, and novel design discovery potentials. Hybrid frameworks that combine physics-based optimization with data-driven representations help escape poor local optima, improve scalability, and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and opportunities, emphasizing complexity management, geometry-independent representations, integration of fabrication constraints, and advancements in multiphysics co-designs.</description>

      <title>BadViM: Backdoor Attack against Vision Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision State Space Models (SSMs), particularly architectures like Vision Mamba (ViM), have emerged as promising alternatives to Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, the security implications of this novel architecture, especially their vulnerability to backdoor attacks, remain critically underexplored. Backdoor attacks aim to embed hidden triggers into victim models, causing the model to misclassify inputs containing these triggers while maintaining normal behavior on clean inputs. This paper investigates the susceptibility of ViM to backdoor attacks by introducing BadViM, a novel backdoor attack framework specifically designed for Vision Mamba. The proposed BadViM leverages a Resonant Frequency Trigger (RFT) that exploits the frequency sensitivity patterns of the victim model to create stealthy, distributed triggers. To maximize attack efficacy, we propose a Hidden State Alignment loss that strategically manipulates the internal representations of model by aligning the hidden states of backdoor images with those of target classes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BadViM achieves superior attack success rates while maintaining clean data accuracy. Meanwhile, BadViM exhibits remarkable resilience against common defensive measures, including PatchDrop, PatchShuffle and JPEG compression, which typically neutralize normal backdoor attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hallucinations are one of the major problems of LLMs, hindering their trustworthiness and deployment to wider use cases. However, most of the research on hallucinations focuses on English data, neglecting the multilingual nature of LLMs. This paper describes our submission to the SemEval-2025 Task-3 - Mu-SHROOM, the Multilingual Shared-task on Hallucinations and Related Observable Overgeneration Mistakes. We propose a two-part pipeline that combines retrieval-based fact verification against Wikipedia with a BERT-based system fine-tuned to identify common hallucination patterns. Our system achieves competitive results across all languages, reaching top-10 results in eight languages, including English. Moreover, it supports multiple languages beyond the fourteen covered by the shared task. This multilingual hallucination identifier can help to improve LLM outputs and their usefulness in the future.</description>

      <title>AI-Generated Video Detection via Perceptual Straightening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI enables highly realistic synthetic videos, posing significant challenges for content authentication and raising urgent concerns about misuse. Existing detection methods often struggle with generalization and capturing subtle temporal inconsistencies. We propose ReStraV(Representation Straightening Video), a novel approach to distinguish natural from AI-generated videos. Inspired by the "perceptual straightening" hypothesis -- which suggests real-world video trajectories become more straight in neural representation domain -- we analyze deviations from this expected geometric property. Using a pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer (DINOv2), we quantify the temporal curvature and stepwise distance in the model's representation domain. We aggregate statistics of these measures for each video and train a classifier. Our analysis shows that AI-generated videos exhibit significantly different curvature and distance patterns compared to real videos. A lightweight classifier achieves state-of-the-art detection performance (e.g., 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC on the VidProM benchmark), substantially outperforming existing image- and video-based methods.

      <title>Quantum Circuit Structure Optimization for Quantum Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal policies through environmental interaction. However, RL suffers from reduced learning efficiency due to the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional spaces. Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) addresses this issue by leveraging superposition and entanglement in quantum computing, allowing efficient handling of high-dimensional problems with fewer resources. QRL combines quantum neural networks (QNNs) with RL, where the parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) acts as the core computational module. The PQC performs linear and nonlinear transformations through gate operations, similar to hidden layers in classical neural networks. Previous QRL studies, however, have used fixed PQC structures based on empirical intuition without verifying their optimality. This paper proposes a QRL-NAS algorithm that integrates quantum neural architecture search (QNAS) to optimize PQC structures within QRL. Experiments demonstrate that QRL-NAS achieves higher rewards than QRL with fixed circuits, validating its effectiveness and practical utility.</description>

      <title>High-resolution spatial memory requires grid-cell-like neural codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous attractor networks (CANs) are widely used to model how the brain temporarily retains continuous behavioural variables via persistent recurrent activity, such as an animal's position in an environment. However, this memory mechanism is very sensitive to even small imperfections, such as noise or heterogeneity, which are both common in biological systems. Previous work has shown that discretising the continuum into a finite set of discrete attractor states provides robustness to these imperfections, but necessarily reduces the resolution of the represented variable, creating a dilemma between stability and resolution. We show that this stability-resolution dilemma is most severe for CANs using unimodal bump-like codes, as in traditional models. To overcome this, we investigate sparse binary distributed codes based on random feature embeddings, in which neurons have spatially-periodic receptive fields. We demonstrate theoretically and with simulations that such grid-cell-like codes enable CANs to achieve both high stability and high resolution simultaneously. The model extends to embedding arbitrary nonlinear manifolds into a CAN, such as spheres or tori, and generalises linear path integration to integration along freely-programmable on-manifold vector fields. Together, this work provides a theory of how the brain could robustly represent continuous variables with high resolution and perform flexible computations over task-relevant manifolds.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Reasonings: Teach Large Language Models to Reason with Adaptive Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks through advanced prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), but their reliance on manually crafted, task-specific prompts limits adaptability and efficiency. We introduce Mixture of Reasoning (MoR), a training framework that embeds diverse reasoning strategies into LLMs for autonomous, task-adaptive reasoning without external prompt engineering. MoR has two phases: Thought Generation, creating reasoning chain templates with models like GPT-4o, and SFT Dataset Construction, pairing templates with benchmark datasets for supervised fine-tuning.Our experiments show that MoR significantly enhances performance, with MoR150 achieving 0.730 (2.2% improvement) using CoT prompting and 0.734 (13.5% improvement) compared to baselines. MoR eliminates the need for task-specific prompts, offering a generalizable solution for robust reasoning across diverse tasks.</description>

      <title>Residual Reward Models for Preference-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) provides a way to learn high-performance policies in environments where the reward signal is hard to specify, avoiding heuristic and time-consuming reward design. However, PbRL can suffer from slow convergence speed since it requires training in a reward model. Prior work has proposed learning a reward model from demonstrations and fine-tuning it using preferences. However, when the model is a neural network, using different loss functions for pre-training and fine-tuning can pose challenges to reliable optimization. In this paper, we propose a method to effectively leverage prior knowledge with a Residual Reward Model (RRM). An RRM assumes that the true reward of the environment can be split into a sum of two parts: a prior reward and a learned reward. The prior reward is a term available before training, for example, a user's ``best guess'' reward function, or a reward function learned from inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), and the learned reward is trained with preferences. We introduce state-based and image-based versions of RRM and evaluate them on several tasks in the Meta-World environment suite. Experimental results show that our method substantially improves the performance of a common PbRL method. Our method achieves performance improvements for a variety of different types of prior rewards, including proxy rewards, a reward obtained from IRL, and even a negated version of the proxy reward. We also conduct experiments with a Franka Panda to show that our method leads to superior performance on a real robot. It significantly accelerates policy learning for different tasks, achieving success in fewer steps than the baseline. The videos are presented at https://sunlighted.github.io/RRM-web/.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural ODEs for Temporal Dynamics Modeling in Cardiac T1 Mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) is an important biomarker in cardiac parametric mapping for characterizing myocardial tissue and diagnosing cardiomyopathies. Conventional Modified Look-Locker Inversion Recovery (MOLLI) acquires 11 breath-hold baseline images with interleaved rest periods to ensure mapping accuracy. However, prolonged scanning can be challenging for patients with poor breathholds, often leading to motion artifacts that degrade image quality. In addition, $T_1$ mapping requires voxel-wise nonlinear fitting to a signal recovery model involving an iterative estimation process. Recent studies have proposed deep-learning approaches for rapid $T_1$ mapping using shortened sequences to reduce acquisition time for patient comfort. Nevertheless, existing methods overlook important physics constraints, limiting interpretability and generalization. In this work, we present an accelerated, end-to-end $T_1$ mapping framework leveraging Physics-Informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to model temporal dynamics and address these challenges. Our method achieves high-accuracy $T_1$ estimation from a sparse subset of baseline images and ensures efficient null index estimation at test time. Specifically, we develop a continuous-time LSTM-ODE model to enable selective Look-Locker (LL) data acquisition with arbitrary time lags. Experimental results show superior performance in $T_1$ estimation for both native and post-contrast sequences and demonstrate the strong benefit of our physics-based formulation over direct data-driven $T_1$ priors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00631v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correctness is an emergent property of systems where exposing error is cheaper than committing it. In dynamic, low-trust environments, autonomous AI agents benefit from delegating work to sub-agents, yet correctness cannot be assured through upfront specification or centralized oversight. We propose a protocol that enforces correctness through collateralized claims in a recursive verification game. Tasks are published as intents, and solvers compete to fulfill them. Selected solvers carry out tasks under risk, with correctness checked post hoc by verifiers. Any challenger can challenge a result by staking against it to trigger the verification process. Incorrect agents are slashed and correct opposition is rewarded, with an escalation path that penalizes erroneous verifiers themselves. When incentives are aligned across solvers, challengers, and verifiers, falsification conditions make correctness the Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Load-Aware Inference: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Optimizing the Token Economy of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The escalating computational costs of Large Language Model (LLM) inference have become a critical barrier to their widespread and sustainable deployment. While existing optimization strategies are effective, they are predominantly based on statistical heuristics or architectural modifications, lacking a guiding cognitive theory to manage the inference process itself. This paper aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel paradigm: the Cognitive Load-Aware Inference (CLAI) framework, which operationalizes principles from Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and neuroscience for LLM inference. We formalize the concepts of Intrinsic Cognitive Load, Extraneous Cognitive Load, and Germane Cognitive Load into quantifiable LLM metrics ($ICL_{LLM}$, $ECL_{LLM}$, and $GCL_{LLM}$), thereby reframing the inference process as a cognitive economics optimization problem: based on the intrinsic complexity of a problem ($ICL_{LLM}$), minimize wasteful computation ($ECL_{LLM}$), and strategically allocate the token budget to productive reasoning ($GCL_{LLM}$). We propose two implementation paths: CLAI-Prompt, a zero-shot method that guides a base LLM through cognitive control steps via a structured meta-prompt, and CLAI-Tune, a fine-tuned model that internalizes these principles for spontaneous cognitive economy. Across a range of benchmarks in complex reasoning, long-context question answering, and code generation, our methods achieve significant reductions in token consumption (up to 45\%) without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, CLAI-Tune exhibits an emergent ability to autonomously decompose difficult problems, a key characteristic of human expert cognition. This work demonstrates that by emulating the brain's resource management strategies, we can build more efficient, robust, and capable artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>Generative Exaggeration in LLM Social Agents: Consistency, Bias, and Toxicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how Large Language Models (LLMs) behave when simulating political discourse on social media. Leveraging 21 million interactions on X during the 2024 U.S. presidential election, we construct LLM agents based on 1,186 real users, prompting them to reply to politically salient tweets under controlled conditions. Agents are initialized either with minimal ideological cues (Zero Shot) or recent tweet history (Few Shot), allowing one-to-one comparisons with human replies. We evaluate three model families (Gemini, Mistral, and DeepSeek) across linguistic style, ideological consistency, and toxicity. We find that richer contextualization improves internal consistency but also amplifies polarization, stylized signals, and harmful language. We observe an emergent distortion that we call "generation exaggeration": a systematic amplification of salient traits beyond empirical baselines. Our analysis shows that LLMs do not emulate users, they reconstruct them. Their outputs, indeed, reflect internal optimization dynamics more than observed behavior, introducing structural biases that compromise their reliability as social proxies. This challenges their use in content moderation, deliberative simulations, and policy modeling.</description>

      <title>MTCNet: Motion and Topology Consistency Guided Learning for Mitral Valve Segmentationin 4D Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mitral regurgitation is one of the most prevalent cardiac disorders. Four-dimensional (4D) ultrasound has emerged as the primary imaging modality for assessing dynamic valvular morphology. However, 4D mitral valve (MV) analysis remains challenging due to limited phase annotations, severe motion artifacts, and poor imaging quality. Yet, the absence of inter-phase dependency in existing methods hinders 4D MV analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose a Motion-Topology guided consistency network (MTCNet) for accurate 4D MV ultrasound segmentation in semi-supervised learning (SSL). MTCNet requires only sparse end-diastolic and end-systolic annotations. First, we design a cross-phase motion-guided consistency learning strategy, utilizing a bi-directional attention memory bank to propagate spatio-temporal features. This enables MTCNet to achieve excellent performance both per- and inter-phase. Second, we devise a novel topology-guided correlation regularization that explores physical prior knowledge to maintain anatomically plausible. Therefore, MTCNet can effectively leverage structural correspondence between labeled and unlabeled phases. Extensive evaluations on the first largest 4D MV dataset, with 1408 phases from 160 patients, show that MTCNet performs superior cross-phase consistency compared to other advanced methods (Dice: 87.30%, HD: 1.75mm). Both the code and the dataset are available at https://github.com/crs524/MTCNet.</description>

      <title>SAFER: Probing Safety in Reward Models with Sparse Autoencoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a key paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, yet the reward models at its core remain largely opaque. In this work, we present sparse Autoencoder For Enhanced Reward model (\textbf{SAFER}), a novel framework for interpreting and improving reward models through mechanistic analysis. Leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), we uncover human-interpretable features in reward model activations, enabling insight into safety-relevant decision-making. We apply SAFER to safety-oriented preference datasets and quantify the salience of individual features by activation differences between chosen and rejected responses. Using these feature-level signals, we design targeted data poisoning and denoising strategies. Experiments show that SAFER can precisely degrade or enhance safety alignment with minimal data modification, without sacrificing general chat performance. Our approach contributes to interpreting, auditing and refining reward models in high-stakes LLM alignment tasks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/xzy-101/SAFER-code. \textit{This paper discusses topics related to large language model safety and may include discussions or examples that highlight potential risks or unsafe outcomes.}</description>

      <title>Audio-3DVG: Unified Audio - Point Cloud Fusion for 3D Visual Grounding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) involves localizing target objects in 3D point clouds based on natural language. While prior work has made strides using textual descriptions, leveraging spoken language-known as Audio-based 3D Visual Grounding-remains underexplored and challenging. Motivated by advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech representation learning, we propose Audio-3DVG, a simple yet effective framework that integrates audio and spatial information for enhanced grounding. Rather than treating speech as a monolithic input, we decompose the task into two complementary components. First, we introduce Object Mention Detection, a multi-label classification task that explicitly identifies which objects are referred to in the audio, enabling more structured audio-scene reasoning. Second, we propose an Audio-Guided Attention module that captures interactions between candidate objects and relational speech cues, improving target discrimination in cluttered scenes. To support benchmarking, we synthesize audio descriptions for standard 3DVG datasets, including ScanRefer, Sr3D, and Nr3D. Experimental results demonstrate that Audio-3DVG not only achieves new state-of-the-art performance in audio-based grounding, but also competes with text-based methods-highlighting the promise of integrating spoken language into 3D vision tasks.</description>

      <title>TopoStreamer: Temporal Lane Segment Topology Reasoning in Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving. On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.4% mAP in lane segment perception and +2.1% OLS in centerline perception tasks.</description>

      <title>Holmes: Towards Effective and Harmless Model Ownership Verification to Personalized Large Vision Models via Decoupling Common Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision models achieve remarkable performance in various downstream tasks, primarily by personalizing pre-trained models through fine-tuning with private and valuable local data, which makes the personalized model a valuable intellectual property for its owner. Similar to the era of traditional DNNs, model stealing attacks also pose significant risks to these personalized models. However, in this paper, we reveal that most existing defense methods (developed for traditional DNNs), typically designed for models trained from scratch, either introduce additional security risks, are prone to misjudgment, or are even ineffective for fine-tuned models. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes a harmless model ownership verification method for personalized models by decoupling similar common features. In general, our method consists of three main stages. In the first stage, we create shadow models that retain common features of the victim model while disrupting dataset-specific features. We represent the dataset-specific features of the victim model by the output differences between the shadow and victim models. After that, a meta-classifier is trained to identify stolen models by determining whether suspicious models contain the dataset-specific features of the victim. In the third stage, we conduct model ownership verification by hypothesis test to mitigate randomness and enhance robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting different types of model stealing simultaneously.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a circuit-algorithm co-design framework for learnable analog front-end (AFE) in audio signal classification. Designing AFE and backend classifiers separately is a common practice but non-ideal, as shown in this paper. Instead, this paper proposes a joint optimization of the backend classifier with the AFE's transfer function to achieve system-level optimum. More specifically, the transfer function parameters of an analog bandpass filter (BPF) bank are tuned in a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-aware training loop for the classifier. Using a co-design loss function LBPF, this work shows superior optimization of both the filter bank and the classifier. Implemented in open-source SKY130 130nm CMOS process, the optimized design achieved 90.5%-94.2% accuracy for 10-keyword classification task across a wide range of input signal SNR from 5 dB to 20 dB, with only 22k classifier parameters. Compared to conventional approach, the proposed audio AFE achieves 8.7% and 12.9% reduction in power and capacitor area respectively.</description>

      <title>LitBench: A Benchmark and Dataset for Reliable Evaluation of Creative Writing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating creative writing generated by large language models (LLMs) remains challenging because open-ended narratives lack ground truths. Without performant automated evaluation methods, off-the-shelf (OTS) language models are employed as zero-shot judges, yet their reliability is unclear in this context. In pursuit of robust evaluation for creative writing, we introduce LitBench, the first standardized benchmark and paired dataset for creative writing verification, comprising a held-out test set of 2,480 debiased, human-labeled story comparisons drawn from Reddit and a 43,827-pair training corpus of human preference labels. Using LitBench, we (i) benchmark zero-shot LLM judges, (ii) train Bradley Terry and generative reward models, and (iii) conduct an online human study to validate reward model rankings on newly LLM-generated stories. Our benchmark identifies Claude-3.7-Sonnet as the strongest off-the-shelf judge, reaching 73% agreement with human preferences; among trained reward models, Bradley-Terry and Generative reward models both attain an accuracy of 78%, outperforming all off-the-shelf judges. An online human study further confirms that our trained reward models consistently align with human preferences in novel LLM-generated stories. We release LitBench and reward models at https://huggingface.co/collections/SAA-Lab/litbench-68267b5da3aafe58f9e43461, providing a vetted resource for reliable, automated evaluation and optimization of creative writing systems.</description>

      <title>Echoes of AI: Investigating the Downstream Effects of AI Assistants on Software Maintainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [Context] AI assistants, like GitHub Copilot and Cursor, are transforming software engineering. While several studies highlight productivity improvements, their impact on maintainability requires further investigation. [Objective] This study investigates whether co-development with AI assistants affects software maintainability, specifically how easily other developers can evolve the resulting source code. [Method] We conducted a two-phase controlled experiment involving 151 participants, 95% of whom were professional developers. In Phase 1, participants added a new feature to a Java web application, with or without AI assistance. In Phase 2, a randomized controlled trial, new participants evolved these solutions without AI assistance. [Results] AI-assisted development in Phase 1 led to a modest speedup in subsequent evolution and slightly higher average CodeHealth. Although neither difference was significant overall, the increase in CodeHealth was statistically significant when habitual AI users completed Phase 1. For Phase 1, we also observed a significant effect that corroborates previous productivity findings: using an AI assistant yielded a 30.7% median decrease in task completion time. Moreover, for habitual AI users, the mean speedup was 55.9%. [Conclusions] Our study adds to the growing evidence that AI assistants can effectively accelerate development. Moreover, we did not observe warning signs of degraded code-level maintainability. We recommend that future research focus on risks such as code bloat from excessive code generation and the build-up of cognitive debt as developers invest less mental effort during implementation.</description>

      <title>LD-RPS: Zero-Shot Unified Image Restoration via Latent Diffusion Recurrent Posterior Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unified image restoration is a significantly challenging task in low-level vision. Existing methods either make tailored designs for specific tasks, limiting their generalizability across various types of degradation, or rely on training with paired datasets, thereby suffering from closed-set constraints. To address these issues, we propose a novel, dataset-free, and unified approach through recurrent posterior sampling utilizing a pretrained latent diffusion model. Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition. Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent refinement for posterior sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and robustness. Our code and data will be available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/LD-RPS.</description>

      <title>Many LLMs Are More Utilitarian Than One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moral judgment is integral to large language model (LLM) alignment and social reasoning. As multi-agent systems gain prominence, it becomes crucial to understand how LLMs function collectively during collaboration, compared to individual agents. In human moral judgment, group deliberation leads to a utilitarian boost: a tendency to endorse norm violations that maximize benefits for the greatest number of people despite harms. We study whether a similar dynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We tested six models on well-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where models reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn discussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must decide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all models found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than individually, similar to human experiments. Some models endorsed actions that maximized overall well-being, even if they benefited strangers over familiar individuals. Others became more willing to violate moral norms in groups. However, while human groups show a similar action bias, the mechanism for their utilitarian boost differs from LLMs. Whereas the human shift comes from heightened sensitivity to decision outcomes, LLM groups show either reduced norm sensitivity or enhanced impartiality. This suggests that while the surface behavior of LLM collectives mimics human group reasoning, the underlying drivers differ. We discuss the implications for AI alignment, multi-agent design, and artificial moral reasoning.</description>

      <title>PI-WAN: A Physics-Informed Wind-Adaptive Network for Quadrotor Dynamics Prediction in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate dynamics modeling is essential for quadrotors to achieve precise trajectory tracking in various applications. Traditional physical knowledge-driven modeling methods face substantial limitations in unknown environments characterized by variable payloads, wind disturbances, and external perturbations. On the other hand, data-driven modeling methods suffer from poor generalization when handling out-of-distribution (OoD) data, restricting their effectiveness in unknown scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce the Physics-Informed Wind-Adaptive Network (PI-WAN), which combines knowledge-driven and data-driven modeling methods by embedding physical constraints directly into the training process for robust quadrotor dynamics learning. Specifically, PI-WAN employs a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) architecture that efficiently captures temporal dependencies from historical flight data, while a physics-informed loss function applies physical principles to improve model generalization and robustness across previously unseen conditions. By incorporating real-time prediction results into a model predictive control (MPC) framework, we achieve improvements in closed-loop tracking performance. Comprehensive simulations and real-world flight experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods in terms of prediction accuracy, tracking precision, and robustness to unknown environments.</description>

      <title>CAVALRY-V: A Large-Scale Generator Framework for Adversarial Attacks on Video MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (V-MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in temporal reasoning and cross-modal understanding, yet their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains underexplored due to unique challenges: complex cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, temporal dependencies, and computational constraints. We present CAVALRY-V (Cross-modal Language-Vision Adversarial Yielding for Videos), a novel framework that directly targets the critical interface between visual perception and language generation in V-MLLMs. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a dual-objective semantic-visual loss function that simultaneously disrupts the model's text generation logits and visual representations to undermine cross-modal integration, and (2) a computationally efficient two-stage generator framework that combines large-scale pre-training for cross-model transferability with specialized fine-tuning for spatiotemporal coherence. Empirical evaluation on comprehensive video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that CAVALRY-V significantly outperforms existing attack methods, achieving 22.8% average improvement over the best baseline attacks on both commercial systems (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.0) and open-source models (QwenVL-2.5, InternVL-2.5, Llava-Video, Aria, MiniCPM-o-2.6). Our framework achieves flexibility through implicit temporal coherence modeling rather than explicit regularization, enabling significant performance improvements even on image understanding (34.4% average gain). This capability demonstrates CAVALRY-V's potential as a foundational approach for adversarial research across multimodal systems.</description>

      <title>Automated anatomy-based post-processing reduces false positives and improved interpretability of deep learning intracranial aneurysm detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduction: Deep learning (DL) models can help detect intracranial aneurysms on CTA, but high false positive (FP) rates remain a barrier to clinical translation, despite improvement in model architectures and strategies like detection threshold tuning. We employed an automated, anatomy-based, heuristic-learning hybrid artery-vein segmentation post-processing method to further reduce FPs. Methods: Two DL models, CPM-Net and a deformable 3D convolutional neural network-transformer hybrid (3D-CNN-TR), were trained with 1,186 open-source CTAs (1,373 annotated aneurysms), and evaluated with 143 held-out private CTAs (218 annotated aneurysms). Brain, artery, vein, and cavernous venous sinus (CVS) segmentation masks were applied to remove possible FPs in the DL outputs that overlapped with: (1) brain mask; (2) vein mask; (3) vein more than artery masks; (4) brain plus vein mask; (5) brain plus vein more than artery masks. Results: CPM-Net yielded 139 true-positives (TP); 79 false-negative (FN); 126 FP. 3D-CNN-TR yielded 179 TP; 39 FN; 182 FP. FPs were commonly extracranial (CPM-Net 27.3%; 3D-CNN-TR 42.3%), venous (CPM-Net 56.3%; 3D-CNN-TR 29.1%), arterial (CPM-Net 11.9%; 3D-CNN-TR 53.3%), and non-vascular (CPM-Net 25.4%; 3D-CNN-TR 9.3%) structures. Method 5 performed best, reducing CPM-Net FP by 70.6% (89/126) and 3D-CNN-TR FP by 51.6% (94/182), without reducing TP, lowering the FP/case rate from 0.88 to 0.26 for CPM-NET, and from 1.27 to 0.62 for the 3D-CNN-TR. Conclusion: Anatomy-based, interpretable post-processing can improve DL-based aneurysm detection model performance. More broadly, automated, domain-informed, hybrid heuristic-learning processing holds promise for improving the performance and clinical acceptance of aneurysm detection models.</description>

      <title>HumanoidGen: Data Generation for Bimanual Dexterous Manipulation via LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For robotic manipulation, existing robotics datasets and simulation benchmarks predominantly cater to robot-arm platforms. However, for humanoid robots equipped with dual arms and dexterous hands, simulation tasks and high-quality demonstrations are notably lacking. Bimanual dexterous manipulation is inherently more complex, as it requires coordinated arm movements and hand operations, making autonomous data collection challenging. This paper presents HumanoidGen, an automated task creation and demonstration collection framework that leverages atomic dexterous operations and LLM reasoning to generate relational constraints. Specifically, we provide spatial annotations for both assets and dexterous hands based on the atomic operations, and perform an LLM planner to generate a chain of actionable spatial constraints for arm movements based on object affordances and scenes. To further improve planning ability, we employ a variant of Monte Carlo tree search to enhance LLM reasoning for long-horizon tasks and insufficient annotation. In experiments, we create a novel benchmark with augmented scenarios to evaluate the quality of the collected data. The results show that the performance of the 2D and 3D diffusion policies can scale with the generated dataset. Project page is https://openhumanoidgen.github.io.</description>

      <title>Stylometry recognizes human and LLM-generated texts in short samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper explores stylometry as a method to distinguish between texts created by Large Language Models (LLMs) and humans, addressing issues of model attribution, intellectual property, and ethical AI use. Stylometry has been used extensively to characterise the style and attribute authorship of texts. By applying it to LLM-generated texts, we identify their emergent writing patterns. The paper involves creating a benchmark dataset based on Wikipedia, with (a) human-written term summaries, (b) texts generated purely by LLMs (GPT-3.5/4, LLaMa 2/3, Orca, and Falcon), (c) processed through multiple text summarisation methods (T5, BART, Gensim, and Sumy), and (d) rephrasing methods (Dipper, T5). The 10-sentence long texts were classified by tree-based models (decision trees and LightGBM) using human-designed (StyloMetrix) and n-gram-based (our own pipeline) stylometric features that encode lexical, grammatical, syntactic, and punctuation patterns. The cross-validated results reached a performance of up to .87 Matthews correlation coefficient in the multiclass scenario with 7 classes, and accuracy between .79 and 1. in binary classification, with the particular example of Wikipedia and GPT-4 reaching up to .98 accuracy on a balanced dataset. Shapley Additive Explanations pinpointed features characteristic of the encyclopaedic text type, individual overused words, as well as a greater grammatical standardisation of LLMs with respect to human-written texts. These results show -- crucially, in the context of the increasingly sophisticated LLMs -- that it is possible to distinguish machine- from human-generated texts at least for a well-defined text type.</description>

      <title>NN-Former: Rethinking Graph Structure in Neural Architecture Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing use of deep learning necessitates efficient network design and deployment, making neural predictors vital for estimating attributes such as accuracy and latency. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and transformers have shown promising performance in representing neural architectures. However, each of both methods has its disadvantages. GNNs lack the capabilities to represent complicated features, while transformers face poor generalization when the depth of architecture grows. To mitigate the above issues, we rethink neural architecture topology and show that sibling nodes are pivotal while overlooked in previous research. We thus propose a novel predictor leveraging the strengths of GNNs and transformers to learn the enhanced topology. We introduce a novel token mixer that considers siblings, and a new channel mixer named bidirectional graph isomorphism feed-forward network. Our approach consistently achieves promising performance in both accuracy and latency prediction, providing valuable insights for learning Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memes are widely used in online social interactions, providing vivid, intuitive, and often humorous means to express intentions and emotions. Existing dialogue datasets are predominantly limited to either manually annotated or pure-text conversations, lacking the expressiveness and contextual nuance that multimodal interactions provide.To address these challenges, we introduce MemeCMD, an automatically generated Chinese Multi-turn Dialogue dataset with contextually retrieved memes. Our dataset combines a large-scale, MLLM-annotated meme library with dialogues auto-generated by dual agents across diverse scenarios. We introduce a retrieval framework and adaptive threshold to ensure contextually relevant, naturally spaced meme usage. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating contextually appropriate and diverse meme-incorporated dialogues, offering a scalable and privacy-preserving resource for advancing multimodal conversational AI.</description>

      <title>Constellation as a Service: Tailored Connectivity Management in Direct-Satellite-to-Device Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct-satellite-to-device (DS2D) communication is emerging as a promising solution for global mobile service extension, leveraging the deployment of satellite constellations. However, the challenge of managing DS2D connectivity for multi-constellations becomes outstanding, including high interference and frequent handovers caused by multi-coverage overlap and rapid satellite movement. Moreover, existing approaches primarily operate within single-constellation shell, which inherently limits the ability to exploit the vast potential of multi-constellation connectivity provision, resulting in suboptimal DS2D service performances. To address these challenges, this article proposes a Constellation as a Service (CaaS) framework, which treats the entire multi-constellation infrastructure as a shared resource pool and dynamically forms optimal sub-constellations (SCs) for each DS2D service region. The formation of each SC integrates satellites from various orbits to provide tailored connectivity based on user demands, guided by two innovative strategies: predictive satellite beamforming using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and pre-configured handover path for efficient satellite access and mobility management. Simulation results demonstrate that CaaS significantly improves satellite service rates while reducing handover overhead, making it an efficient and continuable solution for managing DS2D connectivity in multi-constellation environments.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based segmentation of T1 and T2 cardiac MRI maps for automated disease detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objectives Parametric tissue mapping enables quantitative cardiac tissue characterization but is limited by inter-observer variability during manual delineation. Traditional approaches relying on average relaxation values and single cutoffs may oversimplify myocardial complexity. This study evaluates whether deep learning (DL) can achieve segmentation accuracy comparable to inter-observer variability, explores the utility of statistical features beyond mean T1/T2 values, and assesses whether machine learning (ML) combining multiple features enhances disease detection. Materials &amp; Methods T1 and T2 maps were manually segmented. The test subset was independently annotated by two observers, and inter-observer variability was assessed. A DL model was trained to segment left ventricle blood pool and myocardium. Average (A), lower quartile (LQ), median (M), and upper quartile (UQ) were computed for the myocardial pixels and employed in classification by applying cutoffs or in ML. Dice similarity coefficient (DICE) and mean absolute percentage error evaluated segmentation performance. Bland-Altman plots assessed inter-user and model-observer agreement. Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined optimal cutoffs. Pearson correlation compared features from model and manual segmentations. F1-score, precision, and recall evaluated classification performance. Wilcoxon test assessed differences between classification methods, with p &lt; 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results 144 subjects were split into training (100), validation (15) and evaluation (29) subsets. Segmentation model achieved a DICE of 85.4%, surpassing inter-observer agreement. Random forest applied to all features increased F1-score (92.7%, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion DL facilitates segmentation of T1/ T2 maps. Combining multiple features with ML improves disease detection.</description>

      <title>The Age of Sensorial Zero Trust: Why We Can No Longer Trust Our Senses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a world where deepfakes and cloned voices are emerging as sophisticated attack vectors, organizations require a new security mindset: Sensorial Zero Trust [9]. This article presents a scientific analysis of the need to systematically doubt information perceived through the senses, establishing rigorous verification protocols to mitigate the risks of fraud based on generative artificial intelligence. Key concepts, such as Out-of-Band verification, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as forensic collaborators, cryptographic provenance, and human training, are integrated into a framework that extends Zero Trust principles to human sensory information. The approach is grounded in empirical findings and academic research, emphasizing that in an era of AI-generated realities, even our eyes and ears can no longer be implicitly trusted without verification. Leaders are called to foster a culture of methodological skepticism to protect organizational integrity in this new threat landscape.</description>

      <title>Turning AI Data Centers into Grid-Interactive Assets: Results from a Field Demonstration in Phoenix, Arizona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is fueling exponential electricity demand growth, threatening grid reliability, raising prices for communities paying for new energy infrastructure, and stunting AI innovation as data centers wait for interconnection to constrained grids. This paper presents the first field demonstration, in collaboration with major corporate partners, of a software-only approach--Emerald Conductor--that transforms AI data centers into flexible grid resources that can efficiently and immediately harness existing power systems without massive infrastructure buildout. Conducted at a 256-GPU cluster running representative AI workloads within a commercial, hyperscale cloud data center in Phoenix, Arizona, the trial achieved a 25% reduction in cluster power usage for three hours during peak grid events while maintaining AI quality of service (QoS) guarantees. By orchestrating AI workloads based on real-time grid signals without hardware modifications or energy storage, this platform reimagines data centers as grid-interactive assets that enhance grid reliability, advance affordability, and accelerate AI's development.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Powered Intelligent Urban Agents: Concepts, Capabilities, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long-standing vision of intelligent cities is to create efficient, livable, and sustainable urban environments using big data and artificial intelligence technologies. Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new ways toward realizing this vision. With powerful semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities, LLMs can be deployed as intelligent agents capable of autonomously solving complex problems across domains. In this article, we focus on Urban LLM Agents, which are LLM-powered agents that are semi-embodied within the hybrid cyber-physical-social space of cities and used for system-level urban decision-making. First, we introduce the concept of urban LLM agents, discussing their unique capabilities and features. Second, we survey the current research landscape from the perspective of agent workflows, encompassing urban sensing, memory management, reasoning, execution, and learning. Third, we categorize the application domains of urban LLM agents into five groups: urban planning, transportation, environment, public safety, and urban society, presenting representative works in each group. Finally, we discuss trustworthiness and evaluation issues that are critical for real-world deployment, and identify several open problems for future research. This survey aims to establish a foundation for the emerging field of urban LLM agents and to provide a roadmap for advancing the intersection of LLMs and urban intelligence. A curated list of relevant papers and open-source resources is maintained and continuously updated at https://github.com/usail-hkust/Awesome-Urban-LLM-Agents.</description>

      <title>WebArXiv: Evaluating Multimodal Agents on Time-Invariant arXiv Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled the development of autonomous web agents capable of navigating and interacting with real websites. However, evaluating such agents remains challenging due to the instability and inconsistency of existing benchmarks, which often rely on dynamic content or oversimplified simulations. In this work, we introduce WebArXiv, a static and time-invariant benchmark comprising 275 web-based tasks grounded in the arXiv platform. WebArXiv ensures reproducible and reliable evaluation by anchoring tasks in fixed web snapshots with deterministic ground truths and standardized action trajectories. Through behavioral analysis, we identify a common failure mode, Rigid History Reflection, where agents over-rely on fixed interaction histories. To address this, we propose a lightweight dynamic reflection mechanism that allows agents to selectively retrieve relevant past steps during decision-making. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art web agents on WebArXiv. Results demonstrate clear performance differences across agents and validate the effectiveness of our proposed reflection strategy.</description>

      <title>From Sentences to Sequences: Rethinking Languages in Biological System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paradigm of large language models in natural language processing (NLP) has also shown promise in modeling biological languages, including proteins, RNA, and DNA. Both the auto-regressive generation paradigm and evaluation metrics have been transferred from NLP to biological sequence modeling. However, the intrinsic structural correlations in natural and biological languages differ fundamentally. Therefore, we revisit the notion of language in biological systems to better understand how NLP successes can be effectively translated to biological domains. By treating the 3D structure of biomolecules as the semantic content of a sentence and accounting for the strong correlations between residues or bases, we highlight the importance of structural evaluation and demonstrate the applicability of the auto-regressive paradigm in biological language modeling.

      <title>MambAttention: Mamba with Multi-Head Attention for Generalizable Single-Channel Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of new sequence models like Mamba and xLSTM, several studies have shown that these models match or outperform state-of-the-art models in single-channel speech enhancement, automatic speech recognition, and self-supervised audio representation learning. However, prior research has demonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the training set. To address this issue, previous works have shown that adding self-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for single-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid Mamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance have been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech enhancement. To train our model, we introduce VoiceBank+Demand Extended (VB-DemandEx), a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging noise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, our proposed MambAttention model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar complexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020 and EARS-WHAM_v2, while matching their performance on the in-domain dataset VB-DemandEx. Ablation studies highlight the role of weight sharing between the time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization performance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a notable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets. However, our MambAttention model remains superior on both out-of-domain datasets across all reported evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Surgical Neural Radiance Fields from One Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) offer exceptional capabilities for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, yet their reliance on extensive multi-view data limits their application in surgical intraoperative settings where only limited data is available. In particular, collecting such extensive data intraoperatively is impractical due to time constraints. This work addresses this challenge by leveraging a single intraoperative image and preoperative data to train NeRF efficiently for surgical scenarios.
  Methods: We leverage preoperative MRI data to define the set of camera viewpoints and images needed for robust and unobstructed training. Intraoperatively, the appearance of the surgical image is transferred to the pre-constructed training set through neural style transfer, specifically combining WTC2 and STROTSS to prevent over-stylization. This process enables the creation of a dataset for instant and fast single-image NeRF training.
  Results: The method is evaluated with four clinical neurosurgical cases. Quantitative comparisons to NeRF models trained on real surgical microscope images demonstrate strong synthesis agreement, with similarity metrics indicating high reconstruction fidelity and stylistic alignment. When compared with ground truth, our method demonstrates high structural similarity, confirming good reconstruction quality and texture preservation.
  Conclusion: Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of single-image NeRF training in surgical settings, overcoming the limitations of traditional multi-view methods.</description>

      <title>Reasoning as an Adaptive Defense for Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning methods that adaptively allocate test-time compute have advanced LLM performance on easy to verify domains such as math and code. In this work, we study how to utilize this approach to train models that exhibit a degree of robustness to safety vulnerabilities, and show that doing so can provide benefits. We build a recipe called $\textit{TARS}$ (Training Adaptive Reasoners for Safety), a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains models to reason about safety using chain-of-thought traces and a reward signal that balances safety with task completion. To build TARS, we identify three critical design choices: (1) a "lightweight" warmstart SFT stage, (2) a mix of harmful, harmless, and ambiguous prompts to prevent shortcut behaviors such as too many refusals, and (3) a reward function to prevent degeneration of reasoning capabilities during training. Models trained with TARS exhibit adaptive behaviors by spending more compute on ambiguous queries, leading to better safety-refusal trade-offs. They also internally learn to better distinguish between safe and unsafe prompts and attain greater robustness to both white-box (e.g., GCG) and black-box attacks (e.g., PAIR). Overall, our work provides an effective, open recipe for training LLMs against jailbreaks and harmful requests by reasoning per prompt.</description>

      <title>Robotic Manipulation by Imitating Generated Videos Without Physical Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces Robots Imitating Generated Videos (RIGVid), a system that enables robots to perform complex manipulation tasks--such as pouring, wiping, and mixing--purely by imitating AI-generated videos, without requiring any physical demonstrations or robot-specific training. Given a language command and an initial scene image, a video diffusion model generates potential demonstration videos, and a vision-language model (VLM) automatically filters out results that do not follow the command. A 6D pose tracker then extracts object trajectories from the video, and the trajectories are retargeted to the robot in an embodiment-agnostic fashion. Through extensive real-world evaluations, we show that filtered generated videos are as effective as real demonstrations, and that performance improves with generation quality. We also show that relying on generated videos outperforms more compact alternatives such as keypoint prediction using VLMs, and that strong 6D pose tracking outperforms other ways to extract trajectories, such as dense feature point tracking. These findings suggest that videos produced by a state-of-the-art off-the-shelf model can offer an effective source of supervision for robotic manipulation.</description>

      <title>SciArena: An Open Evaluation Platform for Foundation Models in Scientific Literature Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SciArena, an open and collaborative platform for evaluating foundation models on scientific literature tasks. Unlike traditional benchmarks for scientific literature understanding and synthesis, SciArena engages the research community directly, following the Chatbot Arena evaluation approach of community voting on model comparisons. By leveraging collective intelligence, SciArena offers a community-driven evaluation of model performance on open-ended scientific tasks that demand literature-grounded, long-form responses. The platform currently supports 23 open-source and proprietary foundation models and has collected over 13,000 votes from trusted researchers across diverse scientific domains. We analyze the data collected so far and confirm that the submitted questions are diverse, aligned with real-world literature needs, and that participating researchers demonstrate strong self-consistency and inter-annotator agreement in their evaluations. We discuss the results and insights based on the model ranking leaderboard. To further promote research in building model-based automated evaluation systems for literature tasks, we release SciArena-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark based on our collected preference data. The benchmark measures the accuracy of models in judging answer quality by comparing their pairwise assessments with human votes. Our experiments highlight the benchmark's challenges and emphasize the need for more reliable automated evaluation methods.</description>

      <title>Description of the Training Process of Neural Networks via Ergodic Theorem : Ghost nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have proposed interpreting the training process from an ergodic perspective. Building on this foundation we present a unified framework for understanding and accelerating the training of deep neural networks via stochastic gradient descent. By analyzing the geometric landscape of the objective function we introduce a practical diagnostic, the running estimate of the largest Lyapunov exponent, which provably distinguishes genuine convergence toward stable minimizers from mere statistical stabilization near saddle points. We then propose a ghost category extension for standard classifiers that adds auxiliary ghost output nodes so the model gains extra descent directions that open a lateral corridor around narrow loss barriers and enable the optimizer to bypass poor basins during the early training phase. We show that this extension strictly reduces approximation error and that after sufficient convergence the ghost dimensions collapse and the extended model's invariant law coincides with that of the original and there exists a path in the enlarged parameter space along which the total loss does not increase while the original loss decreases by an arbitrary margin. Taken together these results provide a principled architecture level intervention that accelerates early stage trainability while preserving asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <title>GLM-4.1V-Thinking: Towards Versatile Multimodal Reasoning with Scalable Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01006v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present GLM-4.1V-Thinking, a vision-language model (VLM) designed to advance general-purpose multimodal understanding and reasoning. In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. We then propose Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to unlock the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document understanding. We open-source GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking, which achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size. In a comprehensive evaluation across 28 public benchmarks, our model outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B on nearly all tasks and achieves comparable or even superior performance on 18 benchmarks relative to the significantly larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B. Notably, GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking also demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to closed-source models such as GPT-4o on challenging tasks including long document understanding and STEM reasoning, further underscoring its strong capabilities. Code, models and more information are released at https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-4.1V-Thinking.</description>

Abstract: Environmental disturbances, such as sensor data noises, various lighting conditions, challenging weathers and external adversarial perturbations, are inevitable in real self-driving applications. Existing researches and testings have shown that they can severely influence the vehicles perception ability and performance, one of the main issue is the false positive detection, i.e., the ghost object which is not real existed or occurs in the wrong position (such as a non-existent vehicle). Traditional navigation methods tend to avoid every detected objects for safety, however, avoiding a ghost object may lead the vehicle into a even more dangerous situation, such as a sudden break on the highway. Considering the various disturbance types, it is difficult to address this issue at the perceptual aspect. A potential solution is to detect the ghost through relation learning among the whole scenario and develop an integrated end-to-end navigation system. Our underlying logic is that the behavior of all vehicles in the scene is influenced by their neighbors, and normal vehicles behave in a logical way, while ghost vehicles do not. By learning the spatio-temporal relation among surrounding vehicles, an information reliability representation is learned for each detected vehicle and then a robot navigation network is developed. In contrast to existing works, we encourage the network to learn how to represent the reliability and how to aggregate all the information with uncertainties by itself, thus increasing the efficiency and generalizability. To the best of the authors knowledge, this paper provides the first work on using graph relation learning to achieve end-to-end robust navigation in the presence of ghost vehicles. Simulation results in the CARLA platform demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Flexora: Flexible Low Rank Adaptation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10774v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are driving advancements in artificial intelligence by increasing the scale of model parameters, which has significantly enhanced generalization ability and unlocked new capabilities in practice. However, their performance in specific downstream tasks is usually hindered by their knowledge boundaries on these tasks. Thus, fine-tuning techniques, especially the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method, have been introduced to expand the boundaries on these tasks, whereas LoRA would underperform on certain tasks owing to its potential overfitting on these tasks. To overcome this overfitting and improve the performance of LoRA, we propose the flexible low rank adaptation (Flexora) method to automatically and flexibly select the most important layers needing to be fine-tuned to achieve the best performance on different downstream tasks. Specifically, Flexora firstly frames this layer selection problem as a well-defined hyperparameter optimization (HPO) problem, then addresses it using the unrolled differentiation (UD) method, and finally selects the most useful layers based on the optimized hyperparameters. Our extensive experiments on many pretrained models and natural language tasks show that Flexora is able to consistently improve over the existing baselines, indicating the effectiveness of our Flexora in practice. We additionally provide insightful theoretical results and many ablation studies to deliver a comprehensive understanding of our Flexora.</description>

      <title>OM4OV: Leveraging Ontology Matching for Ontology Versioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20302v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the dynamic nature of the Semantic Web, version control is necessary to capture time-varying information, particularly for widely used ontologies. Despite the long-standing recognition of ontology versioning (OV) as a crucial component for efficient ontology management, the growing size of ontologies and accumulating errors caused by manual labour overwhelm current OV approaches. In this paper, we propose a fresh approach to performing OV using existing ontology matching (OM) techniques and systems. We introduce a unified OM4OV pipeline. From an OM perspective, we reconstruct a new task formulation and measurements for OV tasks. Building upon the prior alignment(s) from OM, we propose a pipeline optimisation method called the cross-reference (CR) mechanism to enhance overall OV performance. We experimentally validate the OM4OV pipeline and the cross-reference mechanism in an OV testbed originating from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) datasets. We also discuss insights into OM used for OV tasks, where some apparent false mappings detected by OV systems are not actually untrue.</description>

      <title>Iterative Resolution of Prompt Ambiguities Using a Progressive Cutting-Search Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI systems have revolutionized human interaction by enabling natural language-based coding and problem solving. However, the inherent ambiguity of natural language often leads to imprecise instructions, forcing users to iteratively test, correct, and resubmit their prompts. We propose an iterative approach that systematically narrows down these ambiguities through a structured series of clarification questions and alternative solution proposals, illustrated with input/output examples as well. Once every uncertainty is resolved, a final, precise solution is generated. Evaluated on a diverse dataset spanning coding, data analysis, and creative writing, our method demonstrates superior accuracy, competitive resolution times, and higher user satisfaction compared to conventional one-shot solutions, which typically require multiple manual iterations to achieve a correct output.</description>

      <title>Free and Fair Hardware: A Pathway to Copyright Infringement-Free Verilog Generation using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Limitations in Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities for hardware design tasks, such as generating functional Verilog codes, have motivated various fine-tuning optimizations utilizing curated hardware datasets from open-source repositories. However, these datasets remain limited in size and contain minimal checks on licensing for reuse, resulting in potential copyright violations by fine-tuned LLMs. Therefore, we propose an evaluation benchmark to estimate the risk of Verilog-trained LLMs to generate copyright-protected codes. To minimize this risk, we present an open-source Verilog dataset, FreeSet, containing over 220k files, along with the automated dataset curation framework utilized to provide additional guarantees of fair-use Verilog data. We then execute an LLM fine-tuning framework consisting of continual pre-training, resulting in a fine-tuned Llama model for Verilog, FreeV. Our results indicate that FreeV demonstrates the smallest risk of copyright-infringement among prior works, with only a 3% violation rate. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate improvements in Verilog generation functionality over its baseline model, improving VerilogEval pass@10 rates by over 10%.</description>

      <title>MMLU-Reason: Benchmarking Multi-Task Multi-modal Language Understanding and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16459v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled unified processing of language, vision, and structured inputs, opening the door to complex tasks such as logical deduction, spatial reasoning, and scientific analysis. Despite their promise, the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, particularly those augmented with intermediate thinking traces (MLLMs-T), remain poorly understood and lack standardized evaluation benchmarks. Existing work focuses primarily on perception or final answer correctness, offering limited insight into how models reason or fail across modalities. To address this gap, we introduce the MMLU-Reason, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate multi-modal reasoning with explicit thinking. The MMLU-Reason comprises 1) a high-difficulty dataset of 1,083 questions spanning six diverse reasoning types with symbolic depth and multi-hop demands and 2) a modular Reasoning Trace Evaluation Pipeline (RTEP) for assessing reasoning quality beyond accuracy through metrics like relevance, consistency, and structured error annotations. Empirical results show that MLLMs-T overall outperform non-thinking counterparts, but even top models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5 Pro suffer from reasoning pathologies such as inconsistency and overthinking. This benchmark reveals persistent gaps between accuracy and reasoning quality and provides an actionable evaluation pipeline for future model development. Overall, the MMLU-Reason offers a scalable foundation for evaluating, comparing, and improving the next generation of multi-modal reasoning systems.</description>

      <title>SwarmThinkers: Learning Physically Consistent Atomic KMC Transitions at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can a scientific simulation system be physically consistent, interpretable by design, and scalable across regimes--all at once? Despite decades of progress, this trifecta remains elusive. Classical methods like Kinetic Monte Carlo ensure thermodynamic accuracy but scale poorly; learning-based methods offer efficiency but often sacrifice physical consistency and interpretability. We present SwarmThinkers, a reinforcement learning framework that recasts atomic-scale simulation as a physically grounded swarm intelligence system. Each diffusing particle is modeled as a local decision-making agent that selects transitions via a shared policy network trained under thermodynamic constraints. A reweighting mechanism fuses learned preferences with transition rates, preserving statistical fidelity while enabling interpretable, step-wise decision making. Training follows a centralized-training, decentralized-execution paradigm, allowing the policy to generalize across system sizes, concentrations, and temperatures without retraining. On a benchmark simulating radiation-induced Fe-Cu alloy precipitation, SwarmThinkers is the first system to achieve full-scale, physically consistent simulation on a single A100 GPU, previously attainable only via OpenKMC on a supercomputer. It delivers up to 4963x (3185x on average) faster computation with 485x lower memory usage. By treating particles as decision-makers, not passive samplers, SwarmThinkers marks a paradigm shift in scientific simulation--one that unifies physical consistency, interpretability, and scalability through agent-driven intelligence.</description>

      <title>Program of Equations Thoughts to Solve Algebra Word Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving algebraic word problems (AWPs) has recently emerged as an important natural language processing task. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful mathematical capabilities, and the Chain-of-Thought technique, which guides LLMs through step-by-step reasoning, has yielded impressive results. However, this reasoning ability is limited by the computational weaknesses of LLMs themselves, where calculation errors can accumulate, leading to incorrect final answers. To address this, we propose Program of Equations Thoughts (POET), which transforms the task of generating step-by-step reasoning answers into a two-stage task of predicting equations and generating code, offloading complex computations to a Python interpreter to avoid calculation errors in LLMs. Furthermore, we propose Zero-shot POET, which utilizes a manually designed template to enable LLMs to directly generate Python code for one-step solving. Our method achieves accuracies of 95.3% and 98.0% on the PEN and ALG514 datasets, respectively, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Zero-shot POET also achieves the SOTA result of 95.5% on the DRAW-1K dataset.</description>

Abstract: Collective Adaptive Intelligence (CAI) represent a transformative approach in embodied AI, wherein numerous autonomous agents collaborate, adapt, and self-organize to navigate complex, dynamic environments. By enabling systems to reconfigure themselves in response to unforeseen challenges, CAI facilitate robust performance in real-world scenarios. This article introduces a conceptual framework for designing and analyzing CAI. It delineates key attributes including task generalization, resilience, scalability, and self-assembly, aiming to bridge theoretical foundations with practical methodologies for engineering adaptive, emergent intelligence. By providing a structured foundation for understanding and implementing CAI, this work seeks to guide researchers and practitioners in developing more resilient, scalable, and adaptable AI systems across various domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapidly improving AI capabilities and autonomy hold significant promise of transformation, but are also driving vigorous debate on how to ensure that AI is safe, i.e., trustworthy, reliable, and secure. Building a trusted ecosystem is therefore essential -- it helps people embrace AI with confidence and gives maximal space for innovation while avoiding backlash.
  The "2025 Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI): International Scientific Exchange on AI Safety" aimed to support research in this space by bringing together AI scientists across geographies to identify and synthesise research priorities in AI safety. This resulting report builds on the International AI Safety Report chaired by Yoshua Bengio and backed by 33 governments. By adopting a defence-in-depth model, this report organises AI safety research domains into three types: challenges with creating trustworthy AI systems (Development), challenges with evaluating their risks (Assessment), and challenges with monitoring and intervening after deployment (Control).</description>

      <title>Active Inference AI Systems for Scientific Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of transformative scientific discovery, yet current systems remain fundamentally limited by their operational architectures, brittle reasoning mechanisms, and their separation from experimental reality. Building on earlier work, we contend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three fundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap -- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning demands internal representations that support simulation of actions and response, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and continuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific discovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in causal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic planners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge graphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes causal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while strengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations through closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and automated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides action and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an architecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models that enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds hypotheses in reality. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties makes human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent architectural component.</description>

      <title>The Automated LLM Speedrunning Benchmark: Reproducing NanoGPT Improvements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to assist in scientific progress. A critical capability toward this endeavor is the ability to reproduce existing work. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to reproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM Speedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the NanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time. Each of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records training script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from pseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records execute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse code-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to hardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible and realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that recent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement already-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our benchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to automate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an autonomous research agent.</description>

      <title>Bridging Ethical Principles and Algorithmic Methods: An Alternative Approach for Assessing Trustworthiness in AI Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology epitomizes the complex challenges posed by human-made artifacts, particularly those widely integrated into society and exert significant influence, highlighting potential benefits and their negative consequences. While other technologies may also pose substantial risks, AI's pervasive reach makes its societal effects especially profound. The complexity of AI systems, coupled with their remarkable capabilities, can lead to a reliance on technologies that operate beyond direct human oversight or understanding. To mitigate the risks that arise, several theoretical tools and guidelines have been developed, alongside efforts to create technological tools aimed at safeguarding Trustworthy AI. The guidelines take a more holistic view of the issue but fail to provide techniques for quantifying trustworthiness. Conversely, while technological tools are better at achieving such quantification, they lack a holistic perspective, focusing instead on specific aspects of Trustworthy AI. This paper aims to introduce an assessment method that combines the ethical components of Trustworthy AI with the algorithmic processes of PageRank and TrustRank. The goal is to establish an assessment framework that minimizes the subjectivity inherent in the self-assessment techniques prevalent in the field by introducing algorithmic criteria. The application of our approach indicates that a holistic assessment of an AI system's trustworthiness can be achieved by providing quantitative insights while considering the theoretical content of relevant guidelines.</description>

      <title>Hecto: Modular Sparse Experts for Adaptive and Interpretable Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable conditional computation by routing inputs to specialized experts, but these experts rely on identical inductive biases, thus limiting representational diversity. This static computation pathway is inefficient for inputs that require different types of reasoning and limits specialization and interpretability. We propose Hecto, a lightweight MoE architecture that leverages architectural heterogeneity by combining a GRU expert for temporal reasoning and an FFNN expert for static abstraction under a sparse Top-1 gating mechanism. Evaluated on three reasoning benchmarks (AG News, SST-2, HotpotQA) and a regression task (STS-B), Hecto matches or closely trails homogeneous baselines in performance despite receiving isolated input representations, while achieving clear expert specialization, with each expert aligning to distinct reasoning types (temporal vs static). At larger batch sizes, Hecto exhibits improved performance, benefiting from relaxed computational constraints that allow its heterogeneous architecture to optimize more effectively. Ablation results isolate architectural diversity as the source of Hecto's stability and interpretability across diverse reasoning tasks. Overall, Hecto establishes itself as a new benchmark for conditional computation, offering a principled framework for specialized reasoning in low-resource regimes with its model strength derived from principled specialization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing interest in robotic synthesis in the context of organic chemistry, the automated extraction of chemical procedures from literature is critical. However, this task remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of chemical language and the high cost of human annotation required for developing reliable computer-aided extraction protocols. Here, we present ChemActor, a fully fine-tuned large language model (LLM), as a chemical executor to convert between unstructured experimental procedures and structured action sequences. We propose a sequential LLM-generated data framework to address the challenges of insufficient and low-quality annotated data. This framework integrates a data selection module that selects data based on distribution divergence, with a general-purpose LLM, to generate machine-executable actions from a single molecule input. Additionally, we introduce a novel multi-round LLMs circle review metric, which reflects the model's advanced understanding of chemical experimental procedures. Extensive experiments on reaction-to-description (R2D) and description-to-action (D2A) tasks demonstrate that ChemActor, augmented by LLM-generated data, achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by 10%.

      <title>SPIRAL: Self-Play on Zero-Sum Games Incentivizes Reasoning via Multi-Agent Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can develop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable rewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and domain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision. Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To enable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online, multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training. Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6% improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000 expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation, and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These results demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable reasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous reasoning development.</description>

      <title>Quasi-symbolic Semantic Geometry over Transformer-based Variational AutoEncoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Formal/symbolic semantics can provide canonical, rigid controllability and interpretability to sentence representations due to their \textit{localisation} or \textit{composition} property. How can we deliver such property to the current distributional sentence representations to control and interpret the generation of language models (LMs)? In this work, we theoretically frame the sentence semantics as the composition of \textit{semantic role - word content} features and propose the formal semantic geometry. To inject such geometry into Transformer-based LMs (i.e. GPT2), we deploy Transformer-based Variational AutoEncoder with a supervision approach, where the sentence generation can be manipulated and explained over low-dimensional latent Gaussian space. In addition, we propose a new probing algorithm to guide the movement of sentence vectors over such geometry. Experimental results reveal that the formal semantic geometry can potentially deliver better control and interpretation to sentence generation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Controllability of Diffusion Models via Feature Disentanglement and Realism-Enhanced Sampling Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14368v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Diffusion Models have shown promising performance, a lot of efforts have been made to improve the controllability of Diffusion Models. However, how to train Diffusion Models to have the disentangled latent spaces and how to naturally incorporate the disentangled conditions during the sampling process have been underexplored. In this paper, we present a training framework for feature disentanglement of Diffusion Models (FDiff). We further propose two sampling methods that can boost the realism of our Diffusion Models and also enhance the controllability. Concisely, we train Diffusion Models conditioned on two latent features, a spatial content mask, and a flattened style embedding. We rely on the inductive bias of the denoising process of Diffusion Models to encode pose/layout information in the content feature and semantic/style information in the style feature. Regarding the sampling methods, we first generalize Composable Diffusion Models (GCDM) by breaking the conditional independence assumption to allow for some dependence between conditional inputs, which is shown to be effective in realistic generation in our experiments. Second, we propose timestep-dependent weight scheduling for content and style features to further improve the performance. We also observe better controllability of our proposed methods compared to existing methods in image manipulation and image translation.</description>

      <title>Junk DNA Hypothesis: Pruning Small Pre-Trained Weights Irreversibly and Monotonically Impairs "Difficult" Downstream Tasks in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Junk DNA Hypothesis by adopting a novel task-centric angle for the pre-trained weights of large language models (LLMs). It has been believed that weights in LLMs contain significant redundancy, leading to the conception that a considerable chunk of the parameters can be removed by pruning without compromising performance. Contrary to this belief, this paper presents a counter-argument: small-magnitude weights of pre-trained model weights encode vital knowledge essential for tackling difficult downstream tasks - manifested as the monotonic relationship between the performance drop of downstream tasks across the difficulty spectrum, as we prune more pre-trained weights by magnitude. Moreover, we reveal that these seemingly inconsequential weights can result in irreparable loss of knowledge and performance degradation in difficult tasks, even when downstream continual training is allowed. Interestingly, our evaluations show that the other popular compression, namely quantization, fails to exhibit similar monotonic effect and does not as convincingly disentangle this task-difficulty information. To study formally, we introduce several quantifiable metrics to gauge the downstream task difficulty: (1) within the same task category, and (2) across different task categories. Our extensive experiments substantiate the Junk DNA Hypothesis across a diverse range of model sizes, tasks, datasets, and even pruning methods. Codes are available at: https://github.com/VITA-Group/Junk_DNA_Hypothesis.git.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Truth of Global Model: A Generic Solution to Defend Against Byzantine and Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning (full version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple parties to train machine learning models collaboratively without sharing the raw training data. However, the federated nature of FL enables malicious clients to influence a trained model by injecting error model updates via Byzantine or backdoor attacks. To detect malicious model updates, a typical approach is to measure the distance between each model update and a \textit{ground-truth model update}. To find such \textit{ground-truth model updates}, existing defenses either require a benign root dataset on the server (e.g., FLTrust) or simply use trimmed mean or median as the threshold for clipping (e.g., FLAME). However, such benign root datasets are impractical, and the trimmed mean or median may also eliminate contributions from these underrepresented datasets.
  In this paper, we propose a generic solution, namely FedTruth, to defend against model poisoning attacks in FL, where the \textit{ground-truth model update} (i.e., the global model update) will be estimated among all the model updates with dynamic aggregation weights. Specifically, FedTruth does not have specific assumptions on the benign or malicious data distribution or access to a benign root dataset. Moreover, FedTruth considers the potential contributions from all benign clients. Our empirical results show that FedTruth can reduce the impacts of poisoned model updates against both Byzantine and backdoor attacks, and is also efficient in large-scale FL systems.</description>

      <title>Realism in Action: Anomaly-Aware Diagnosis of Brain Tumors from Medical Images Using YOLOv8 and DeiT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03302v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable diagnosis of brain tumors remains challenging due to low clinical incidence rates of such cases. However, this low rate is neglected in most of proposed methods. We propose a clinically inspired framework for anomaly-resilient tumor detection and classification. Detection leverages YOLOv8n fine-tuned on a realistically imbalanced dataset (1:9 tumor-to-normal ratio; 30,000 MRI slices from 81 patients). In addition, we propose a novel Patient-to-Patient (PTP) metric that evaluates diagnostic reliability at the patient level. Classification employs knowledge distillation: a Data Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) student model is distilled from a ResNet152 teacher. The distilled ViT achieves an F1-score of 0.92 within 20 epochs, matching near teacher performance (F1=0.97) with significantly reduced computational resources. This end-to-end framework demonstrates high robustness in clinically representative anomaly-distributed data, offering a viable tool that adheres to realistic situations in clinics.</description>

      <title>Quantifying analogy of concepts via ologs and wiring diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build on the theory of ontology logs (ologs) created by Spivak and Kent, and define a notion of wiring diagrams. In this article, a wiring diagram is a finite directed labelled graph. The labels correspond to types in an olog; they can also be interpreted as readings of sensors in an autonomous system. As such, wiring diagrams can be used as a framework for an autonomous system to form abstract concepts. We show that the graphs underlying skeleton wiring diagrams form a category. This allows skeleton wiring diagrams to be compared and manipulated using techniques from both graph theory and category theory. We also extend the usual definition of graph edit distance to the case of wiring diagrams by using operations only available to wiring diagrams, leading to a metric on the set of all skeleton wiring diagrams. In the end, we give an extended example on calculating the distance between two concepts represented by wiring diagrams, and explain how to apply our framework to any application domain.</description>

      <title>Fully Differentiable Lagrangian Convolutional Neural Network for Physics-Informed Precipitation Nowcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a convolutional neural network model for precipitation nowcasting that combines data-driven learning with physics-informed domain knowledge. We propose LUPIN, a Lagrangian Double U-Net for Physics-Informed Nowcasting, that draws from existing extrapolation-based nowcasting methods. It consists of a U-Net that dynamically produces mesoscale advection motion fields, a differentiable semi-Lagrangian extrapolation operator, and an advection-free U-Net capturing the growth and decay of precipitation over time. Using our approach, we successfully implement the Lagrangian convolutional neural network for precipitation nowcasting in a fully differentiable and GPU-accelerated manner. This allows for end-to-end training and inference, including the data-driven Lagrangian coordinate system transformation of the data at runtime. We evaluate the model and compare it with other related AI-based models both quantitatively and qualitatively in an extreme event case study. Based on our evaluation, LUPIN matches and even exceeds the performance of the chosen benchmarks, opening the door for other Lagrangian machine learning models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce StreakNet-Arch, a real-time, end-to-end binary-classification framework based on our self-developed Underwater Carrier LiDAR-Radar (UCLR) that embeds Self-Attention and our novel Double Branch Cross Attention (DBC-Attention) to enhance scatter suppression. Under controlled water tank validation conditions, StreakNet-Arch with Self-Attention or DBC-Attention outperforms traditional bandpass filtering and achieves higher $F_1$ scores than learning-based MP networks and CNNs at comparable model size and complexity. Real-time benchmarks on an NVIDIA RTX 3060 show a constant Average Imaging Time (54 to 84 ms) regardless of frame count, versus a linear increase (58 to 1,257 ms) for conventional methods. To facilitate further research, we contribute a publicly available streak-tube camera image dataset contains 2,695,168 real-world underwater 3D point cloud data. More importantly, we validate our UCLR system in a South China Sea trial, reaching an error of 46mm for 3D target at 1,000 m depth and 20 m range.

      <title>Large Language Model Confidence Estimation via Black-Box Access</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04370v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating uncertainty or confidence in the responses of a model can be significant in evaluating trust not only in the responses, but also in the model as a whole. In this paper, we explore the problem of estimating confidence for responses of large language models (LLMs) with simply black-box or query access to them. We propose a simple and extensible framework where, we engineer novel features and train a (interpretable) model (viz. logistic regression) on these features to estimate the confidence. We empirically demonstrate that our simple framework is effective in estimating confidence of Flan-ul2, Llama-13b, Mistral-7b and GPT-4 on four benchmark Q\&amp;A tasks as well as of Pegasus-large and BART-large on two benchmark summarization tasks with it surpassing baselines by even over $10\%$ (on AUROC) in some cases. Additionally, our interpretable approach provides insight into features that are predictive of confidence, leading to the interesting and useful discovery that our confidence models built for one LLM generalize zero-shot across others on a given dataset.</description>

      <title>Transformers from Diffusion: A Unified Framework for Neural Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09111v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning representations for structured data with certain geometries (e.g., observed or unobserved) is a fundamental challenge, wherein message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have become a de facto class of model solutions. In this paper, inspired by physical systems, we propose an energy-constrained diffusion model, which integrates the inductive bias of diffusion on manifolds with layer-wise constraints of energy minimization. We identify that the diffusion operators have a one-to-one correspondence with the energy functions implicitly descended by the diffusion process, and the finite-difference iteration for solving the energy-constrained diffusion system induces the propagation layers of various types of MPNNs operating on observed or latent structures. This leads to a unified mathematical framework for common neural architectures whose computational flows can be cast as message passing (or its special case), including MLPs, GNNs, and Transformers. Building on these insights, we devise a new class of neural message passing models, dubbed diffusion-inspired Transformers (DIFFormer), whose global attention layers are derived from the principled energy-constrained diffusion framework. Across diverse datasets ranging from real-world networks to images, texts, and physical particles, we demonstrate that the new model achieves promising performance in scenarios where the data structures are observed (as a graph), partially observed, or entirely unobserved.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks Generalize on Low Complexity Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12446v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation generalize on low complexity data, suitably defined. Given i.i.d.~data generated from a simple programming language, the minimum description length (MDL) feedforward neural network which interpolates the data generalizes with high probability. We define this simple programming language, along with a notion of description length of such networks. We provide several examples on basic computational tasks, such as checking primality of a natural number. For primality testing, our theorem shows the following and more. Suppose that we draw an i.i.d.~sample of $n$ numbers uniformly at random from $1$ to $N$. For each number $x_i$, let $y_i = 1$ if $x_i$ is a prime and $0$ if it is not. Then, the interpolating MDL network accurately answers, with error probability $1- O((\ln N)/n)$, whether a newly drawn number between $1$ and $N$ is a prime or not. Note that the network is not designed to detect primes; minimum description learning discovers a network which does so. Extensions to noisy data are also discussed, suggesting that MDL neural network interpolators can demonstrate tempered overfitting.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates efficient deduplication techniques for a large NLP dataset of economic research paper titles. We explore various pairing methods alongside established distance measures (Levenshtein distance, cosine similarity) and a sBERT model for semantic evaluation. Our findings suggest a potentially low prevalence of duplicates based on the observed semantic similarity across different methods. Further exploration with a human-annotated ground truth set is completed for a more conclusive assessment. The result supports findings from the NLP, LLM based distance metrics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04403</link>

Abstract: Learned sparse retrieval, which can efficiently perform retrieval through mature inverted-index engines, has garnered growing attention in recent years. Particularly, the inference-free sparse retrievers are attractive as they eliminate online model inference in the retrieval phase thereby avoids huge computational cost, offering reasonable throughput and latency. However, even the state-of-the-art (SOTA) inference-free sparse models lag far behind in terms of search relevance when compared to both sparse and dense siamese models. Towards competitive search relevance for inference-free sparse retrievers, we argue that they deserve dedicated training methods other than using same ones with siamese encoders. In this paper, we propose two different approaches for performance improvement. First, we propose an IDF-aware penalty for the matching function that suppresses the contribution of low-IDF tokens and increases the model's focus on informative terms. Moreover, we propose a heterogeneous ensemble knowledge distillation framework that combines siamese dense and sparse retrievers to generate supervisory signals during the pre-training phase. The ensemble framework of dense and sparse retriever capitalizes on their strengths respectively, providing a strong upper bound for knowledge distillation. To concur the diverse feedback from heterogeneous supervisors, we normalize and then aggregate the outputs of the teacher models to eliminate score scale differences. On the BEIR benchmark, our model outperforms existing SOTA inference-free sparse model by \textbf{3.3 NDCG@10 score}. It exhibits search relevance comparable to siamese sparse retrievers and client-side latency only \textbf{1.1x that of BM25}.</description>

      <title>SPGD: Steepest Perturbed Gradient Descent Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization algorithms are pivotal in advancing various scientific and industrial fields but often encounter obstacles such as trapping in local minima, saddle points, and plateaus (flat regions), which makes the convergence to reasonable or near-optimal solutions particularly challenging. This paper presents the Steepest Perturbed Gradient Descent (SPGD), a novel algorithm that innovatively combines the principles of the gradient descent method with periodic uniform perturbation sampling to effectively circumvent these impediments and lead to better solutions whenever possible. SPGD is distinctively designed to generate a set of candidate solutions and select the one exhibiting the steepest loss difference relative to the current solution. It enhances the traditional gradient descent approach by integrating a strategic exploration mechanism that significantly increases the likelihood of escaping sub-optimal local minima and navigating complex optimization landscapes effectively. Our approach not only retains the directed efficiency of gradient descent but also leverages the exploratory benefits of stochastic perturbations, thus enabling a more comprehensive search for global optima across diverse problem spaces. We demonstrate the efficacy of SPGD in solving the 3D component packing problem, an NP-hard challenge. Preliminary results show a substantial improvement over four established methods, particularly on response surfaces with complex topographies and in multidimensional non-convex continuous optimization problems. Comparative analyses with established 2D benchmark functions highlight SPGD's superior performance, showcasing its ability to navigate complex optimization landscapes. These results emphasize SPGD's potential as a versatile tool for a wide range of optimization problems.</description>

      <title>VideoCogQA: A Controllable Benchmark for Evaluating Cognitive Abilities in Video-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Video-Language Models (LVLMs) have led to promising results in multimodal video understanding. However, it remains unclear whether these models possess the cognitive capabilities required for high-level tasks, particularly those involving symbolic and abstract perception. Existing benchmarks typically rely on real-world, annotated videos, which lack control over video content and inherent difficulty, limiting their diagnostic power. To bridge this gap, we propose VideoCogQA, a scalable and fully controllable benchmark inspired by game-world environments, designed to evaluate the cognitive abilities of LVLMs. By generating synthetic videos via a programmatic engine, VideoCogQA allows fine-grained control over visual elements, temporal dynamics, and task difficulty. This approach enables a focused evaluation of video cognitive abilities, independent of prior knowledge from visual scene semantics. The dataset includes 800 videos and 3,280 question-answer pairs, featuring tasks related to abstract concepts, symbolic elements, and multimodal integration, with varying levels of difficulty. Experimental results show that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, such as GPT-4o, achieve an average performance of 48.8% on tasks involving abstract concepts. Additionally, performance drops by 15% as task complexity increases, highlighting the challenges LVLMs face in maintaining consistent performance. Through this work, we hope to show the limitations of current LVLMs and offer insights into how they can more effectively emulate human cognitive processes in the future.</description>

      <title>From Holistic to Localized: Local Enhanced Adapters for Efficient Visual Instruction Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient Visual Instruction Fine-Tuning (EVIT) seeks to adapt Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to downstream tasks with minimal computational overhead. However, as task diversity and complexity increase, EVIT faces significant challenges in resolving data conflicts. To address this limitation, we propose the Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (Dual-LoRA), a holistic-to-local framework that enhances the adapter's capacity to address data conflict through dual structural optimization. Specifically, we utilize two subspaces: a skill space for stable, holistic knowledge retention, and a rank-rectified task space that locally activates the holistic knowledge. Additionally, we introduce Visual Cue Enhancement (VCE), a multi-level local feature aggregation module designed to enrich the vision-language projection with local details. Our approach is both memory- and time-efficient, requiring only 1.16$\times$ the inference time of the standard LoRA method (with injection into the query and value projection layers), and just 73\% of the inference time of a 4-expert LoRA-MoE. Extensive experiments on various downstream tasks and general MLLM benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Identity Preserving 3D Head Stylization with Multiview Score Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D head stylization transforms realistic facial features into artistic representations, enhancing user engagement across gaming and virtual reality applications. While 3D-aware generators have made significant advancements, many 3D stylization methods primarily provide near-frontal views and struggle to preserve the unique identities of original subjects, often resulting in outputs that lack diversity and individuality. This paper addresses these challenges by leveraging the PanoHead model, synthesizing images from a comprehensive 360-degree perspective. We propose a novel framework that employs negative log-likelihood distillation (LD) to enhance identity preservation and improve stylization quality. By integrating multi-view grid score and mirror gradients within the 3D GAN architecture and introducing a score rank weighing technique, our approach achieves substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements. Our findings not only advance the state of 3D head stylization but also provide valuable insights into effective distillation processes between diffusion models and GANs, focusing on the critical issue of identity preservation.

      <title>SMoLoRA: Exploring and Defying Dual Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Visual Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual instruction tuning (VIT) enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively handle a wide range of vision tasks by framing them as language-based instructions. Building on this, continual visual instruction tuning (CVIT) extends the capability of MLLMs to incrementally learn new tasks, accommodating evolving functionalities. While prior work has advanced CVIT through the development of new benchmarks and approaches to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, these efforts largely follow traditional continual learning paradigms, neglecting the unique challenges specific to CVIT. We identify a dual form of catastrophic forgetting in CVIT, where MLLMs not only forget previously learned visual understanding but also experience a decline in instruction following abilities as they acquire new tasks. To address this, we introduce the Separable Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (SMoLoRA) framework, which employs separable routing through two distinct modules-one for visual understanding and another for instruction following. This dual-routing design enables specialized adaptation in both domains, preventing forgetting while improving performance. Furthermore, we propose a new CVIT benchmark that goes beyond existing benchmarks by additionally evaluating a model's ability to generalize to unseen tasks and handle diverse instructions across various tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SMoLoRA outperforms existing methods in mitigating dual forgetting, improving generalization to unseen tasks, and ensuring robustness in following diverse instructions.

      <title>An Automatic Graph Construction Framework based on Large Language Models for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as state-of-the-art methods to learn from graph-structured data for recommendation. However, most existing GNN-based recommendation methods focus on the optimization of model structures and learning strategies based on pre-defined graphs, neglecting the importance of the graph construction stage. Earlier works for graph construction usually rely on speciffic rules or crowdsourcing, which are either too simplistic or too labor-intensive. Recent works start to utilize large language models (LLMs) to automate the graph construction, in view of their abundant open-world knowledge and remarkable reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, they generally suffer from two limitations: (1) invisibility of global view (e.g., overlooking contextual information) and (2) construction inefficiency. To this end, we introduce AutoGraph, an automatic graph construction framework based on LLMs for recommendation. Specifically, we first use LLMs to infer the user preference and item knowledge, which is encoded as semantic vectors. Next, we employ vector quantization to extract the latent factors from the semantic vectors. The latent factors are then incorporated as extra nodes to link the user/item nodes, resulting in a graph with in-depth global-view semantics. We further design metapath-based message aggregation to effectively aggregate the semantic and collaborative information. The framework is model-agnostic and compatible with different backbone models. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy and efffciency of AutoGraph compared to existing baseline methods. We have deployed AutoGraph in Huawei advertising platform, and gain a 2.69% improvement on RPM and a 7.31% improvement on eCPM in the online A/B test. Currently AutoGraph has been used as the main trafffc model, serving hundreds of millions of people.</description>

      <title>Establishing baselines for generative discovery of inorganic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising avenue for materials discovery, yet its advantages over traditional methods remain unclear. In this work, we introduce and benchmark two baseline approaches - random enumeration of charge-balanced prototypes and data-driven ion exchange of known compounds - against four generative techniques based on diffusion models, variational autoencoders, and large language models. Our results show that established methods such as ion exchange are better at generating novel materials that are stable, although many of these closely resemble known compounds. In contrast, generative models excel at proposing novel structural frameworks and, when sufficient training data is available, can more effectively target properties such as electronic band gap and bulk modulus. To enhance the performance of both the baseline and generative approaches, we implement a post-generation screening step in which all proposed structures are passed through stability and property filters from pre-trained machine learning models including universal interatomic potentials. This low-cost filtering step leads to substantial improvement in the success rates of all methods, remains computationally efficient, and ultimately provides a practical pathway toward more effective generative strategies for materials discovery. By establishing baselines for comparison, this work highlights opportunities for continued advancement of generative models, especially for the targeted generation of novel materials that are thermodynamically stable.</description>

      <title>A Study of In-Context-Learning-Based Text-to-SQL Errors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been adopted to perform text-to-SQL tasks, utilizing their in-context learning (ICL) capability to translate natural language questions into structured query language (SQL). However, such a technique faces correctness problems and requires efficient repairing solutions. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study of text-to-SQL errors. Our study covers four representative ICL-based techniques, five basic repairing methods, two benchmarks, and two LLM settings. We find that text-to-SQL errors are widespread and summarize 29 error types of 7 categories. We also find that existing repairing attempts have limited correctness improvement at the cost of high computational overhead with many mis-repairs. Based on the findings, we propose MapleRepair, a novel text-to-SQL error detection and repairing framework. The evaluation demonstrates that MapleRepair outperforms existing solutions by repairing 13.8% more queries with neglectable mis-repairs and 67.4% less overhead.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation for Remote Sensing Images via Multi-scale Uncertainty Consistency and Cross-Teacher-Student Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning offers an appealing solution for remote sensing (RS) image segmentation to relieve the burden of labor-intensive pixel-level labeling. However, RS images pose unique challenges, including rich multi-scale features and high inter-class similarity. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised Multi-Scale Uncertainty and Cross-Teacher-Student Attention (MUCA) model for RS image semantic segmentation tasks. Specifically, MUCA constrains the consistency among feature maps at different layers of the network by introducing a multi-scale uncertainty consistency regularization. It improves the multi-scale learning capability of semi-supervised algorithms on unlabeled data. Additionally, MUCA utilizes a Cross-Teacher-Student attention mechanism to guide the student network, guiding the student network to construct more discriminative feature representations through complementary features from the teacher network. This design effectively integrates weak and strong augmentations (WA and SA) to further boost segmentation performance. To verify the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on ISPRS-Potsdam and LoveDA datasets. The experimental results show the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods. Notably, our model excels in distinguishing highly similar objects, showcasing its potential for advancing semi-supervised RS image segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>Robust Representation Consistency Model via Contrastive Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robustness is essential for deep neural networks, especially in security-sensitive applications. To this end, randomized smoothing provides theoretical guarantees for certifying robustness against adversarial perturbations. Recently, diffusion models have been successfully employed for randomized smoothing to purify noise-perturbed samples before making predictions with a standard classifier. While these methods excel at small perturbation radii, they struggle with larger perturbations and incur a significant computational overhead during inference compared to classical methods. To address this, we reformulate the generative modeling task along the diffusion trajectories in pixel space as a discriminative task in the latent space. Specifically, we use instance discrimination to achieve consistent representations along the trajectories by aligning temporally adjacent points. After fine-tuning based on the learned representations, our model enables implicit denoising-then-classification via a single prediction, substantially reducing inference costs. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal computation budget during inference. For example, our method outperforms the certified accuracy of diffusion-based methods on ImageNet across all perturbation radii by 5.3% on average, with up to 11.6% at larger radii, while reducing inference costs by 85$\times$ on average.

      <title>Accelerating Quantum Reinforcement Learning with a Quantum Natural Policy Gradient Based Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) under model-free settings with quantum oracle access to the Markov Decision Process (MDP). This paper introduces a Quantum Natural Policy Gradient (QNPG) algorithm, which replaces the random sampling used in classical Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) estimators with a deterministic gradient estimation approach, enabling seamless integration into quantum systems. While this modification introduces a bounded bias in the estimator, the bias decays exponentially with increasing truncation levels. This paper demonstrates that the proposed QNPG algorithm achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1.5})$ for queries to the quantum oracle, significantly improving the classical lower bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ for queries to the MDP.</description>

      <title>Towards Large-Scale In-Context Reinforcement Learning by Meta-Training in Randomized Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) enables agents to learn automatically and on-the-fly from their interactive experiences. However, a major challenge in scaling up ICRL is the lack of scalable task collections. To address this, we propose the procedurally generated tabular Markov Decision Processes, named AnyMDP. Through a carefully designed randomization process, AnyMDP is capable of generating high-quality tasks on a large scale while maintaining relatively low structural biases. To facilitate efficient meta-training at scale, we further introduce step-wise supervision and induce prior information in the ICRL framework.Our results demonstrate that, with a sufficiently large scale of AnyMDP tasks, the proposed model can generalize to tasks that were not considered in the training set. The scalable task set provided by AnyMDP also enables a more thorough empirical investigation of the relationship between data distribution and ICRL performance. We further show that the generalization of ICRL potentially comes at the cost of increased task diversity and longer adaptation periods. This finding carries critical implications for scaling robust ICRL capabilities, highlighting the necessity of diverse and extensive task design, and prioritizing asymptotic performance over few-shot adaptation.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Life of Tokens: Reducing Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models via Visual Information Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can reason effectively over both textual and visual inputs, but they tend to hallucinate syntactically coherent yet visually ungrounded contents. In this paper, we investigate the internal dynamics of hallucination by examining the tokens logits ranking throughout the generation process, revealing three key patterns in how LVLMs process information: (1) gradual visual information loss - visually grounded tokens gradually become less favored throughout generation, and (2) early excitation - semantically meaningful tokens achieve peak activation in the layers earlier than the final layer. (3) hidden genuine information - visually grounded tokens though not being eventually decoded still retain relatively high rankings at inference. Based on these insights, we propose VISTA (Visual Information Steering with Token-logit Augmentation), a training-free inference-time intervention framework that reduces hallucination while promoting genuine information. VISTA works by combining two complementary approaches: reinforcing visual information in activation space and leveraging early layer activations to promote semantically meaningful decoding. Compared to existing methods, VISTA requires no external supervision and is applicable to various decoding strategies. Extensive experiments show that VISTA on average reduces hallucination by about 40% on evaluated open-ended generation task, and it consistently outperforms existing methods on four benchmarks across four architectures under three decoding strategies.

      <title>Position: Emergent Machina Sapiens Urge Rethinking Multi-Agent Paradigms</title>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents capable of autonomous learning and independent decision-making hold great promise for addressing complex challenges across various critical infrastructure domains, including transportation, energy systems, and manufacturing. However, the surge in the design and deployment of AI systems, driven by various stakeholders with distinct and unaligned objectives, introduces a crucial challenge: How can uncoordinated AI systems coexist and evolve harmoniously in shared environments without creating chaos or compromising safety? To address this, we advocate for a fundamental rethinking of existing multi-agent frameworks, such as multi-agent systems and game theory, which are largely limited to predefined rules and static objective structures. We posit that AI agents should be empowered to adjust their objectives dynamically, make compromises, form coalitions, and safely compete or cooperate through evolving relationships and social feedback. Through two case studies in critical infrastructure applications, we call for a shift toward the emergent, self-organizing, and context-aware nature of these multi-agentic AI systems.</description>

      <title>The Curse of Depth in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Curse of Depth, a concept that highlights, explains, and addresses the recent observation in modern Large Language Models (LLMs) where nearly half of the layers are less effective than expected. We first confirm the wide existence of this phenomenon across the most popular families of LLMs such as Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, and Qwen. Our analysis, theoretically and empirically, identifies that the underlying reason for the ineffectiveness of deep layers in LLMs is the widespread usage of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN). While Pre-LN stabilizes the training of Transformer LLMs, its output variance exponentially grows with the model depth, which undesirably causes the derivative of the deep Transformer blocks to be an identity matrix, and therefore barely contributes to the training. To resolve this training pitfall, we propose LayerNorm Scaling (LNS), which scales the variance of output of the layer normalization inversely by the square root of its depth. This simple modification mitigates the output variance explosion of deeper Transformer layers, improving their contribution. Across a wide range of model sizes (130M to 7B), our experiments show that LNS consistently outperforms previous normalization and scaling techniques in enhancing LLM pre-training performance. Moreover, this improvement seamlessly carries over to supervised fine-tuning. All these gains can be attributed to the fact that LayerNorm Scaling enables deeper layers to contribute more effectively during training. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/lmsdss/LayerNorm-Scaling}{LayerNorm-Scaling}.</description>

      <title>Conformal Inference under High-Dimensional Covariate Shifts via Likelihood-Ratio Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13030v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of conformal prediction under covariate shift. Given labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a covariate shifted target domain, we seek to construct prediction sets with valid marginal coverage in the target domain. Most existing methods require estimating the unknown likelihood ratio function, which can be prohibitive for high-dimensional data such as images. To address this challenge, we introduce the likelihood ratio regularized quantile regression (LR-QR) algorithm, which combines the pinball loss with a novel choice of regularization in order to construct a threshold function without directly estimating the unknown likelihood ratio. We show that the LR-QR method has coverage at the desired level in the target domain, up to a small error term that we can control. Our proofs draw on a novel analysis of coverage via stability bounds from learning theory. Our experiments demonstrate that the LR-QR algorithm outperforms existing methods on high-dimensional prediction tasks, including a regression task for the Communities and Crime dataset, an image classification task from the WILDS repository, and an LLM question-answering task on the MMLU benchmark.</description>

      <title>SAGE: Steering Dialog Generation with Future-Aware State-Action Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in task-oriented applications, yet building emotionally intelligent chatbots that can engage in natural, strategic conversations remains a challenge. We present a novel approach called SAGE that uses latent variables to control long-horizon behavior in dialogue generation. At the core of our method is the State-Action Chain (SAC), which augments standard language model fine-tuning by introducing latent variables that encapsulate emotional states and conversational strategies between dialogue turns. During inference, these variables are generated before each response, enabling coarse-grained control over dialogue progression while maintaining natural interaction patterns. We also introduce a self-improvement pipeline that leverages dialogue tree search, LLM-based reward modeling, and targeted fine-tuning to optimize conversational trajectories. Our experimental results show that models trained with this approach demonstrate improved performance in emotional intelligence metrics while maintaining strong capabilities on LLM benchmarks. The discrete nature of our latent variables facilitates search-based strategies and provides a foundation for future applications of reinforcement learning to dialogue systems, where learning can occur at the state level rather than the token level. https://github.com/apple/ml-sage-dialog-gen</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hallucinations in YOLO-based Object Detection Models: A Revisit to Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object detection systems must reliably perceive objects of interest without being overly confident to ensure safe decision-making in dynamic environments. Filtering techniques based on out-of-distribution (OoD) detection are commonly added as an extra safeguard to filter hallucinations caused by overconfidence in novel objects. Nevertheless, evaluating YOLO-family detectors and their filters under existing OoD benchmarks often leads to unsatisfactory performance. This paper studies the underlying reasons for performance bottlenecks and proposes a methodology to improve performance fundamentally. Our first contribution is a calibration of all existing evaluation results: Although images in existing OoD benchmark datasets are claimed not to have objects within in-distribution (ID) classes (i.e., categories defined in the training dataset), around 13% of objects detected by the object detector are actually ID objects. Dually, the ID dataset containing OoD objects can also negatively impact the decision boundary of filters. These ultimately lead to a significantly imprecise performance estimation. Our second contribution is to consider the task of hallucination reduction as a joint pipeline of detectors and filters. By developing a methodology to carefully synthesize an OoD dataset that semantically resembles the objects to be detected, and using the crafted OoD dataset in the fine-tuning of YOLO detectors to suppress the objectness score, we achieve a 88% reduction in overall hallucination error with a combined fine-tuned detection and filtering system on the self-driving benchmark BDD-100K. Our code and dataset are available at: https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/dnn-safety/m-hood.</description>

      <title>CoCMT: Communication-Efficient Cross-Modal Transformer for Collaborative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception enhances each agent perceptual capabilities by sharing sensing information to cooperatively perform robot perception tasks. This approach has proven effective in addressing challenges such as sensor deficiencies, occlusions, and long-range perception. However, existing representative collaborative perception systems transmit intermediate feature maps, such as bird-eye view (BEV) representations, which contain a significant amount of non-critical information, leading to high communication bandwidth requirements. To enhance communication efficiency while preserving perception capability, we introduce CoCMT, an object-query-based collaboration framework that optimizes communication bandwidth by selectively extracting and transmitting essential features. Within CoCMT, we introduce the Efficient Query Transformer (EQFormer) to effectively fuse multi-agent object queries and implement a synergistic deep supervision to enhance the positive reinforcement between stages, leading to improved overall performance. Experiments on OPV2V and V2V4Real datasets show CoCMT outperforms state-of-the-art methods while drastically reducing communication needs. On V2V4Real, our model (Top-50 object queries) requires only 0.416 Mb bandwidth, 83 times less than SOTA methods, while improving AP70 by 1.1 percent. This efficiency breakthrough enables practical collaborative perception deployment in bandwidth-constrained environments without sacrificing detection accuracy.</description>

      <title>RLCAD: Reinforcement Learning Training Gym for Revolution Involved CAD Command Sequence Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A CAD command sequence is a typical parametric design paradigm in 3D CAD systems where a model is constructed by overlaying 2D sketches with operations such as extrusion, revolution, and Boolean operations. Although there is growing academic interest in the automatic generation of command sequences, existing methods and datasets only support operations such as 2D sketching, extrusion,and Boolean operations. This limitation makes it challenging to represent more complex geometries. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) training environment (gym) built on a CAD geometric engine. Given an input boundary representation (B-Rep) geometry, the policy network in the RL algorithm generates an action. This action, along with previously generated actions, is processed within the gym to produce the corresponding CAD geometry, which is then fed back into the policy network. The rewards, determined by the difference between the generated and target geometries within the gym, are used to update the RL network. Our method supports operations beyond sketches, Boolean, and extrusion, including revolution operations. With this training gym, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality in generating command sequences from B-Rep geometries.</description>

      <title>ResearchBench: Benchmarking LLMs in Scientific Discovery via Inspiration-Based Task Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in assisting scientific research, yet their ability to discover high-quality research hypotheses remains unexamined due to the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLMs with a near-sufficient set of sub-tasks of scientific discovery: inspiration retrieval, hypothesis composition, and hypothesis ranking. We develop an automated framework that extracts critical components - research questions, background surveys, inspirations, and hypotheses - from scientific papers across 12 disciplines, with expert validation confirming its accuracy. To prevent data contamination, we focus exclusively on papers published in 2024, ensuring minimal overlap with LLM pretraining data. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs perform well in retrieving inspirations, an out-of-distribution task, suggesting their ability to surface novel knowledge associations. This positions LLMs as "research hypothesis mines", capable of facilitating automated scientific discovery by generating innovative hypotheses at scale with minimal human intervention.</description>

      <title>An evaluation of LLMs and Google Translate for translation of selected Indian languages via sentiment and semantic analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have been prominent for language translation, including low-resource languages. There has been limited study on the assessment of the quality of translations generated by LLMs, including Gemini, GPT, and Google Translate. This study addresses this limitation by using semantic and sentiment analysis of selected LLMs for Indian languages, including Sanskrit, Telugu and Hindi. We select prominent texts (Bhagavad Gita, Tamas and Maha Prasthanam ) that have been well translated by experts and use LLMs to generate their translations into English, and provide a comparison with selected expert (human) translations. Our investigation revealed that while LLMs have made significant progress in translation accuracy, challenges remain in preserving sentiment and semantic integrity, especially in metaphorical and philosophical contexts for texts such as the Bhagavad Gita. The sentiment analysis revealed that GPT models are better at preserving the sentiment polarity for the given texts when compared to human (expert) translation. The results revealed that GPT models are generally better at maintaining the sentiment and semantics when compared to Google Translate. This study could help in the development of accurate and culturally sensitive translation systems for large language models.</description>

      <title>T2I-R1: Reinforcing Image Generation with Collaborative Semantic-level and Token-level CoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how chain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance. However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1.

      <description>arXiv:2505.00949v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Llama-Nemotron series of models, an open family of heterogeneous reasoning models that deliver exceptional reasoning capabilities, inference efficiency, and an open license for enterprise use. The family comes in three sizes -- Nano (8B), Super (49B), and Ultra (253B) -- and performs competitively with state-of-the-art reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 while offering superior inference throughput and memory efficiency. In this report, we discuss the training procedure for these models, which entails using neural architecture search from Llama 3 models for accelerated inference, knowledge distillation, and continued pretraining, followed by a reasoning-focused post-training stage consisting of two main parts: supervised fine-tuning and large scale reinforcement learning. Llama-Nemotron models are the first open-source models to support a dynamic reasoning toggle, allowing users to switch between standard chat and reasoning modes during inference. To further support open research and facilitate model development, we provide the following resources: 1. We release the Llama-Nemotron reasoning models -- LN-Nano, LN-Super, and LN-Ultra -- under the commercially permissive NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement. 2. We release the complete post-training dataset: Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset. 3. We also release our training codebases: NeMo, NeMo-Aligner, and Megatron-LM.</description>

      <title>Evaluating GPT- and Reasoning-based Large Language Models on Physics Olympiad Problems: Surpassing Human Performance and Implications for Educational Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely accessible, reaching learners at all educational levels. This development has raised concerns that their use may circumvent essential learning processes and compromise the integrity of established assessment formats. In physics education, where problem solving plays a central role in instruction and assessment, it is therefore essential to understand the physics-specific problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. Such understanding is key to informing responsible and pedagogically sound approaches to integrating LLMs into instruction and assessment. This study therefore compares the problem-solving performance of a general-purpose LLM (GPT-4o, using varying prompting techniques) and a reasoning-optimized model (o1-preview) with that of participants of the German Physics Olympiad, based on a set of well-defined Olympiad problems. In addition to evaluating the correctness of the generated solutions, the study analyzes characteristic strengths and limitations of LLM-generated solutions. The findings of this study indicate that both tested LLMs (GPT-4o and o1-preview) demonstrate advanced problem-solving capabilities on Olympiad-type physics problems, on average outperforming the human participants. Prompting techniques had little effect on GPT-4o's performance, while o1-preview almost consistently outperformed both GPT-4o and the human benchmark. Based on these findings, the study discusses implications for the design of summative and formative assessment in physics education, including how to uphold assessment integrity and support students in critically engaging with LLMs.</description>

      <title>AudioTrust: Benchmarking the Multifaceted Trustworthiness of Audio Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement and expanding applications of Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) demand a rigorous understanding of their trustworthiness. However, systematic research on evaluating these models, particularly concerning risks unique to the audio modality, remains largely unexplored. Existing evaluation frameworks primarily focus on the text modality or address only a restricted set of safety dimensions, failing to adequately account for the unique characteristics and application scenarios inherent to the audio modality. We introduce AudioTrust-the first multifaceted trustworthiness evaluation framework and benchmark specifically designed for ALLMs. AudioTrust facilitates assessments across six key dimensions: fairness, hallucination, safety, privacy, robustness, and authentication. To comprehensively evaluate these dimensions, AudioTrust is structured around 18 distinct experimental setups. Its core is a meticulously constructed dataset of over 4,420 audio/text samples, drawn from real-world scenarios (e.g., daily conversations, emergency calls, voice assistant interactions), specifically designed to probe the multifaceted trustworthiness of ALLMs. For assessment, the benchmark carefully designs 9 audio-specific evaluation metrics, and we employ a large-scale automated pipeline for objective and scalable scoring of model outputs. Experimental results reveal the trustworthiness boundaries and limitations of current state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source ALLMs when confronted with various high-risk audio scenarios, offering valuable insights for the secure and trustworthy deployment of future audio models. Our platform and benchmark are available at https://github.com/JusperLee/AudioTrust.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent in global applications, ensuring that they are toxicity-free across diverse linguistic contexts remains a critical challenge. We explore "Cross-lingual Detoxification", a cross-lingual paradigm that mitigates toxicity, enabling detoxification capabilities to transfer between high and low-resource languages across different script families. We analyze cross-lingual detoxification's effectiveness through 392 extensive settings to evaluate toxicity reduction in cross-distribution settings with limited data and investigate how mitigation impacts model performance on non-toxic tasks, revealing trade-offs between safety and knowledge preservation. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/himanshubeniwal/Breaking-mBad.</description>

      <title>From Tokens to Thoughts: How LLMs and Humans Trade Compression for Meaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans organize knowledge into compact categories through semantic compression by mapping diverse instances to abstract representations while preserving meaning (e.g., robin and blue jay are both birds; most birds can fly). These concepts reflect a trade-off between expressive fidelity and representational simplicity. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable linguistic abilities, yet whether their internal representations strike a human-like trade-off between compression and semantic fidelity is unclear. We introduce a novel information-theoretic framework, drawing from Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle, to quantitatively compare these strategies. Analyzing token embeddings from a diverse suite of LLMs against seminal human categorization benchmarks, we uncover key divergences. While LLMs form broad conceptual categories that align with human judgment, they struggle to capture the fine-grained semantic distinctions crucial for human understanding. More fundamentally, LLMs demonstrate a strong bias towards aggressive statistical compression, whereas human conceptual systems appear to prioritize adaptive nuance and contextual richness, even if this results in lower compressional efficiency by our measures. These findings illuminate critical differences between current AI and human cognitive architectures, guiding pathways toward LLMs with more human-aligned conceptual representations.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Regularization-Based Structured Pruning for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is largely hindered by their large number of parameters. Structural pruning has emerged as a promising solution. Prior structured pruning methods directly remove unimportant parameters based on certain metrics, which often causes knowledge loss and necessitates extensive retraining. To overcome this, we introduce a novel pruning method TRSP: Two-Stage Regularization-Based Structured Pruning for LLMs. Specifically, we multiply the output of each transformer layer by an initial learnable weight and iteratively learn these weights by adding their $\ell_1$-norm as a regularization term to the loss function, serving as the first-stage regularization. Subsequently, we apply additional regularization to the difference between the output and input of layers with smaller weights, encouraging the shift of knowledge to the preserved layers. This serves as the second-stage regularization. TRSP retains more knowledge and better preserves model performance than direct parameter elimination. Through extensive experimentation we show that TRSP outperforms strong layer-wise structured pruning methods without requiring retraining. As a layer-wise pruning method, it delivers notable end-to-end acceleration, making it a promising solution for efficient LLM deployment.</description>

      <title>MLR-Bench: Evaluating AI Agents on Open-Ended Machine Learning Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in AI agents have demonstrated their growing potential to drive and support scientific discovery. In this work, we introduce MLR-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents on open-ended machine learning research. MLR-Bench includes three key components: (1) 201 research tasks sourced from NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML workshops covering diverse ML topics; (2) MLR-Judge, an automated evaluation framework combining LLM-based reviewers with carefully designed review rubrics to assess research quality; and (3) MLR-Agent, a modular agent scaffold capable of completing research tasks through four stages: idea generation, proposal formulation, experimentation, and paper writing. Our framework supports both stepwise assessment across these distinct research stages, and end-to-end evaluation of the final research paper. We then use MLR-Bench to evaluate six frontier LLMs and an advanced coding agent, finding that while LLMs are effective at generating coherent ideas and well-structured papers, current coding agents frequently (e.g., in 80% of the cases) produce fabricated or invalidated experimental results--posing a major barrier to scientific reliability. We validate MLR-Judge through human evaluation, showing high agreement with expert reviewers, supporting its potential as a scalable tool for research evaluation. We open-source MLR-Bench to help the community benchmark, diagnose, and improve AI research agents toward trustworthy and transparent scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Avoid Forgetting by Preserving Global Knowledge Gradients in Federated Learning with Non-IID Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20485v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inevitable presence of data heterogeneity has made federated learning very challenging. There are numerous methods to deal with this issue, such as local regularization, better model fusion techniques, and data sharing. Though effective, they lack a deep understanding of how data heterogeneity can affect the global decision boundary. In this paper, we bridge this gap by performing an experimental analysis of the learned decision boundary using a toy example. Our observations are surprising: (1) we find that the existing methods suffer from forgetting and clients forget the global decision boundary and only learn the perfect local one, and (2) this happens regardless of the initial weights, and clients forget the global decision boundary even starting from pre-trained optimal weights. In this paper, we present FedProj, a federated learning framework that robustly learns the global decision boundary and avoids its forgetting during local training. To achieve better ensemble knowledge fusion, we design a novel server-side ensemble knowledge transfer loss to further calibrate the learned global decision boundary. To alleviate the issue of learned global decision boundary forgetting, we further propose leveraging an episodic memory of average ensemble logits on a public unlabeled dataset to regulate the gradient updates at each step of local training. Experimental results demonstrate that FedProj outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.</description>

      <title>Learning from Videos for 3D World: Enhancing MLLMs with 3D Vision Geometry Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous research has investigated the application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding 3D scenes by interpreting them as videos. These approaches generally depend on comprehensive 3D data inputs, such as point clouds or reconstructed Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps. In our research, we advance this field by enhancing the capability of MLLMs to understand and reason in 3D spaces directly from video data, without the need for additional 3D input. We propose a novel and efficient method, the Video-3D Geometry Large Language Model (VG LLM). Our approach employs a 3D visual geometry encoder that extracts 3D prior information from video sequences. This information is integrated with visual tokens and fed into the MLLM. Extensive experiments have shown that our method has achieved substantial improvements in various tasks related to 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning, all directly learned from video sources. Impressively, our 4B model, which does not rely on explicit 3D data inputs, achieves competitive results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and even surpasses the Gemini-1.5-Pro in the VSI-Bench evaluations.</description>

      <title>eACGM: Non-instrumented Performance Tracing and Anomaly Detection towards Machine Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present eACGM, a full-stack AI/ML system monitoring framework based on eBPF. eACGM collects real-time performance data from key hardware components, including the GPU and network communication layer, as well as from key software stacks such as CUDA, Python, and PyTorch, all without requiring any code instrumentation or modifications. Additionally, it leverages libnvml to gather process-level GPU resource usage information. By applying a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the collected multidimensional performance metrics for statistical modeling and clustering analysis, eACGM effectively identifies complex failure modes, such as latency anomalies, hardware failures, and communication inefficiencies, enabling rapid diagnosis of system bottlenecks and abnormal behaviors.
  To evaluate eACGM's effectiveness and practicality, we conducted extensive empirical studies and case analyses in multi-node distributed training scenarios. The results demonstrate that eACGM, while maintaining a non-intrusive and low-overhead profile, successfully captures critical performance anomalies during model training and inference. Its stable anomaly detection performance and comprehensive monitoring capabilities validate its applicability and scalability in real-world production environments, providing strong support for performance optimization and fault diagnosis in large-scale AI/ML systems.</description>

      <title>Bregman Centroid Guided Cross-Entropy Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) is a widely adopted trajectory optimizer in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), but its unimodal sampling strategy often leads to premature convergence in multimodal landscapes. In this work, we propose Bregman Centroid Guided CEM ($\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM), a lightweight enhancement to ensemble CEM that leverages $\textit{Bregman centroids}$ for principled information aggregation and diversity control. $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ computes a performance-weighted Bregman centroid across CEM workers and updates the least contributing ones by sampling within a trust region around the centroid. Leveraging the duality between Bregman divergences and exponential family distributions, we show that $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ integrates seamlessly into standard CEM pipelines with negligible overhead. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks, a cluttered navigation task, and full MBRL pipelines demonstrate that $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ enhances both convergence and solution quality, providing a simple yet effective upgrade for CEM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying a Machine Learning (ML) training pipeline into production requires good software engineering practices. Unfortunately, the typical data science workflow often leads to code that lacks critical software quality attributes. This experience report investigates this problem in SPIRA, a project whose goal is to create an ML-Enabled System (MLES) to pre-diagnose insufficiency respiratory via speech analysis. This paper presents an overview of the architecture of the MLES, then compares three versions of its Continuous Training subsystem: from a proof of concept Big Ball of Mud (v1), to a design pattern-based Modular Monolith (v2), to a test-driven set of Microservices (v3) Each version improved its overall extensibility, maintainability, robustness, and resiliency. The paper shares challenges and lessons learned in this process, offering insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to productionize their pipelines.</description>

      <title>Beyond Attention or Similarity: Maximizing Conditional Diversity for Token Pruning in MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts, leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner, which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/Theia-4869/CDPruner.</description>

      <title>A Minimalist Method for Fine-tuning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune text-to-image diffusion models, improving text-image alignment and sample quality. However, existing approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full sampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference datasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the "golden noise" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most significant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps increases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present. These findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis and reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Unleashing Diffusion and State Space Models for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing segmentation models trained on a single medical imaging dataset often lack robustness when encountering unseen organs or tumors. Developing a robust model capable of identifying rare or novel tumor categories not present during training is crucial for advancing medical imaging applications. We propose DSM, a novel framework that leverages diffusion and state space models to segment unseen tumor categories beyond the training data. DSM utilizes two sets of object queries trained within modified attention decoders to enhance classification accuracy. Initially, the model learns organ queries using an object-aware feature grouping strategy to capture organ-level visual features. It then refines tumor queries by focusing on diffusion-based visual prompts, enabling precise segmentation of previously unseen tumors. Furthermore, we incorporate diffusion-guided feature fusion to improve semantic segmentation performance. By integrating CLIP text embeddings, DSM captures category-sensitive classes to improve linguistic transfer knowledge, thereby enhancing the model's robustness across diverse scenarios and multi-label tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DSM in various tumor segmentation tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Rows21/k-Means_Mask_Mamba.</description>

      <title>Discrete Diffusion in Large Language and Multimodal Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs). Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. Recently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x acceleration in inference speed.
  The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven by progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs and MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and foundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing domain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete diffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and dMLLMs research in early 2025.
  In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative models. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains. We conclude by discussing future directions for research and deployment.

      <title>Studying and Improving Graph Neural Network-based Motif Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a predominant method for graph representation learning. However, beyond subgraph frequency estimation, their application to network motif significance-profile (SP) prediction remains under-explored, with no established benchmarks in the literature. We propose to address this problem, framing SP estimation as a task independent of subgraph frequency estimation. Our approach shifts from frequency counting to direct SP estimation and modulates the problem as multitarget regression. The reformulation is optimised for interpretability, stability and scalability on large graphs. We validate our method using a large synthetic dataset and further test it on real-world graphs. Our experiments reveal that 1-WL limited models struggle to make precise estimations of SPs. However, they can generalise to approximate the graph generation processes of networks by comparing their predicted SP with the ones originating from synthetic generators. This first study on GNN-based motif estimation also hints at how using direct SP estimation can help go past the theoretical limitations that motif estimation faces when performed through subgraph counting.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving LLM Interaction with Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning and Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as personal agents, accessing sensitive user data such as calendars, emails, and medical records. Users currently face a trade-off: They can send private records, many of which are stored in remote databases, to powerful but untrusted LLM providers, increasing their exposure risk. Alternatively, they can run less powerful models locally on trusted devices. We bridge this gap. Our Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning first sends a generic, non-private user query to a powerful, untrusted LLM, which generates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt and detailed sub-queries without accessing user data. Next, we embed these sub-queries and perform encrypted sub-second semantic search using our Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database across one million entries of a single user's private data. This represents a realistic scale of personal documents, emails, and records accumulated over years of digital activity. Finally, we feed the CoT prompt and the decrypted records to a local language model and generate the final response. On the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark, our hybrid framework, combining GPT-4o with a local Llama-3.2-1B model, outperforms using GPT-4o alone by up to 7.1 percentage points. This demonstrates a first step toward systems where tasks are decomposed and split between untrusted strong LLMs and weak local ones, preserving user privacy.</description>

      <title>CARTS: Collaborative Agents for Recommendation Textual Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current recommendation systems often require some form of textual data summarization, such as generating concise and coherent titles for product carousels or other grouped item displays. While large language models have shown promise in NLP domains for textual summarization, these approaches do not directly apply to recommendation systems, where explanations must be highly relevant to the core features of item sets, adhere to strict word limit constraints. In this paper, we propose CARTS (Collaborative Agents for Recommendation Textual Summarization), a multi-agent LLM framework designed for structured summarization in recommendation systems. CARTS decomposes the task into three stages-Generation Augmented Generation (GAG), refinement circle, and arbitration, where successive agent roles are responsible for extracting salient item features, iteratively refining candidate titles based on relevance and length feedback, and selecting the final title through a collaborative arbitration process. Experiments on large-scale e-commerce data and live A/B testing show that CARTS significantly outperforms single-pass and chain-of-thought LLM baselines, delivering higher title relevance and improved user engagement metrics.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the Pedagogical Knowledge of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benchmarks like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) have played a pivotal role in evaluating AI's knowledge and abilities across diverse domains. However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on content knowledge, leaving a critical gap in assessing models' understanding of pedagogy - the method and practice of teaching. This paper introduces The Pedagogy Benchmark, a novel dataset designed to evaluate large language models on their Cross-Domain Pedagogical Knowledge (CDPK) and Special Education Needs and Disability (SEND) pedagogical knowledge. These benchmarks are built on a carefully curated set of questions sourced from professional development exams for teachers, which cover a range of pedagogical subdomains such as teaching strategies and assessment methods. Here we outline the methodology and development of these benchmarks. We report results for 97 models, with accuracies spanning a range from 28% to 89% on the pedagogical knowledge questions. We consider the relationship between cost and accuracy and chart the progression of the Pareto value frontier over time. We provide online leaderboards at https://rebrand.ly/pedagogy which are updated with new models and allow interactive exploration and filtering based on various model properties, such as cost per token and open-vs-closed weights, as well as looking at performance in different subjects. LLMs and generative AI have tremendous potential to influence education and help to address the global learning crisis. Education-focused benchmarks are crucial to measure models' capacities to understand pedagogical concepts, respond appropriately to learners' needs, and support effective teaching practices across diverse contexts. They are needed for informing the responsible and evidence-based deployment of LLMs and LLM-based tools in educational settings, and for guiding both development and policy decisions.</description>

      <title>Language Models Might Not Understand You: Evaluating Theory of Mind via Story Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{StorySim}$, a programmable framework for synthetically generating stories to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM) capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that may suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable $\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects. Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.</description>

      <title>AirV2X: Unified Air-Ground Vehicle-to-Everything Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While multi-vehicular collaborative driving demonstrates clear advantages over single-vehicle autonomy, traditional infrastructure-based V2X systems remain constrained by substantial deployment costs and the creation of "uncovered danger zones" in rural and suburban areas. We present AirV2X-Perception, a large-scale dataset that leverages Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as a flexible alternative or complement to fixed Road-Side Units (RSUs). Drones offer unique advantages over ground-based perception: complementary bird's-eye-views that reduce occlusions, dynamic positioning capabilities that enable hovering, patrolling, and escorting navigation rules, and significantly lower deployment costs compared to fixed infrastructure. Our dataset comprises 6.73 hours of drone-assisted driving scenarios across urban, suburban, and rural environments with varied weather and lighting conditions. The AirV2X-Perception dataset facilitates the development and standardized evaluation of Vehicle-to-Drone (V2D) algorithms, addressing a critical gap in the rapidly expanding field of aerial-assisted autonomous driving systems. The dataset and development kits are open-sourced at https://github.com/taco-group/AirV2X-Perception.</description>

      <title>Generating and Customizing Robotic Arm Trajectories using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a neural network approach for generating and customizing the trajectory of a robotic arm, that guarantees precision and repeatability. To highlight the potential of this novel method, we describe the design and implementation of the technique and show its application in an experimental setting of cognitive robotics. In this scenario, the NICO robot was characterized by the ability to point to specific points in space with precise linear movements, increasing the predictability of the robotic action during its interaction with humans. To achieve this goal, the neural network computes the forward kinematics of the robot arm. By integrating it with a generator of joint angles, another neural network was developed and trained on an artificial dataset created from suitable start and end poses of the robotic arm. Through the computation of angular velocities, the robot was characterized by its ability to perform the movement, and the quality of its action was evaluated in terms of shape and accuracy. Thanks to its broad applicability, our approach successfully generates precise trajectories that could be customized in their shape and adapted to different settings.</description>

      <title>ComRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Dynamic Vector Stores for Real-time Community Question Answering in Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms can be deemed as important knowledge bases in community, but effectively leveraging historical interactions and domain knowledge in real-time remains a challenge. Existing methods often underutilize external knowledge, fail to incorporate dynamic historical QA context, or lack memory mechanisms suited for industrial deployment. We propose ComRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for real-time industrial CQA that integrates static knowledge with dynamic historical QA pairs via a centroid-based memory mechanism designed for retrieval, generation, and efficient storage. Evaluated on three industrial CQA datasets, ComRAG consistently outperforms all baselines--achieving up to 25.9% improvement in vector similarity, reducing latency by 8.7% to 23.3%, and lowering chunk growth from 20.23% to 2.06% over iterations.</description>

      <title>Binned semiparametric Bayesian networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new type of probabilistic semiparametric model that takes advantage of data binning to reduce the computational cost of kernel density estimation in nonparametric distributions. Two new conditional probability distributions are developed for the new binned semiparametric Bayesian networks, the sparse binned kernel density estimation and the Fourier kernel density estimation. These two probability distributions address the curse of dimensionality, which typically impacts binned models, by using sparse tensors and restricting the number of parent nodes in conditional probability calculations. To evaluate the proposal, we perform a complexity analysis and conduct several comparative experiments using synthetic data and datasets from the UCI Machine Learning repository. The experiments include different binning rules, parent restrictions, grid sizes, and number of instances to get a holistic view of the model's behavior. As a result, our binned semiparametric Bayesian networks achieve structural learning and log-likelihood estimations with no statistically significant differences compared to the semiparametric Bayesian networks, but at a much higher speed. Thus, the new binned semiparametric Bayesian networks prove to be a reliable and more efficient alternative to their non-binned counterparts.</description>

      <title>Dehazing Light Microscopy Images with Guided Conditional Flow Matching: finding a sweet spot between fidelity and realism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data. Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID. Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on 5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available under a permissive license.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce HyperCLOVA X THINK, the first reasoning-focused large language model in the HyperCLOVA X family, pre-trained on roughly $6$ trillion high-quality Korean, and English tokens, augmented with targeted synthetic Korean data. It was implemented as a compute-memory-balanced Peri-LN Transformer scaled with $\mu$P, pre-trained through a three-stage curriculum that expands the context window to $128$K tokens, and post-trained via supervised fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards supports both detailed rationale and concise-answer modes. It delivers competitive performance against similarly sized models on Korea-focused benchmarks such as KMMLU, CSAT, KoBALT-700, HAERAE-1.0, and KoBigBench, while preserving robust bilingual consistency and translation quality. In addition, a vision-augmented variant matches or exceeds GPT-4.1 on the KCSAT STEM benchmark, all of which are achieved with substantially lower training compute than existing models of similar sizes. We also present a pruning and distillation technique that will soon be applied to HyperCLOVA X THINK for an open-source and business-friendly foundation model. Altogether, these capabilities position HyperCLOVA X THINK as a robust foundation for Korean AI innovation and a valuable resource for the global research community.</description>

      <title>Red Teaming for Generative AI, Report on a Copyright-Focused Exercise Completed in an Academic Medical Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) deployment in healthcare settings raises copyright compliance concerns. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute implemented GPT4DFCI, an internal generative AI tool utilizing OpenAI models, that is approved for enterprise use in research and operations. Given (i) the exceptionally broad adoption of the tool in our organization, (ii) our research mission, and (iii) the shared responsibility model required by Microsoft OpenAI products, we deemed rigorous copyright compliance testing necessary.
  Case Description: We conducted a structured red teaming exercise in Nov. 2024, with 42 participants from academic, industry, and government institutions. Four teams attempted to extract copyrighted content from GPT4DFCI across four domains: literary works, news articles, scientific publications, and access-restricted clinical notes. Teams successfully extracted verbatim book dedications and near-exact passages through indirect prompting strategies. News article extraction failed despite jailbreak attempts. Scientific article reproduction yielded only high-level summaries. Clinical note testing revealed appropriate privacy safeguards with data reformatting rather than reproduction.
  Discussion: The successful extraction of literary content indicates potential copyright material presence in training data, necessitating enhanced inference-time filtering. Differential success rates across content types suggest varying protective mechanisms. The event led to implementation of a copyright-specific meta-prompt in GPT4DFCI; this mitigation is in production since Jan. 2025.
  Conclusion: Systematic red teaming revealed specific vulnerabilities in generative AI copyright compliance, leading to concrete mitigation strategies. Academic medical institutions deploying generative AI must implement continuous testing protocols to ensure legal and ethical compliance.</description>

      <title>Seamless Interaction: Dyadic Audiovisual Motion Modeling and Large-Scale Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human communication involves a complex interplay of verbal and nonverbal signals, essential for conveying meaning and achieving interpersonal goals. To develop socially intelligent AI technologies, it is crucial to develop models that can both comprehend and generate dyadic behavioral dynamics. To this end, we introduce the Seamless Interaction Dataset, a large-scale collection of over 4,000 hours of face-to-face interaction footage from over 4,000 participants in diverse contexts. This dataset enables the development of AI technologies that understand dyadic embodied dynamics, unlocking breakthroughs in virtual agents, telepresence experiences, and multimodal content analysis tools. We also develop a suite of models that utilize the dataset to generate dyadic motion gestures and facial expressions aligned with human speech. These models can take as input both the speech and visual behavior of their interlocutors. We present a variant with speech from an LLM model and integrations with 2D and 3D rendering methods, bringing us closer to interactive virtual agents. Additionally, we describe controllable variants of our motion models that can adapt emotional responses and expressivity levels, as well as generating more semantically-relevant gestures. Finally, we discuss methods for assessing the quality of these dyadic motion models, which are demonstrating the potential for more intuitive and responsive human-AI interactions.</description>

      <title>Text Production and Comprehension by Human and Artificial Intelligence: Interdisciplinary Workshop Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report synthesizes the outcomes of a recent interdisciplinary workshop that brought together leading experts in cognitive psychology, language learning, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based natural language processing (NLP). The workshop, funded by the National Science Foundation, aimed to address a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of the relationship between AI language models and human cognitive processes in text comprehension and composition. Through collaborative dialogue across cognitive, linguistic, and technological perspectives, workshop participants examined the underlying processes involved when humans produce and comprehend text, and how AI can both inform our understanding of these processes and augment human capabilities. The workshop revealed emerging patterns in the relationship between large language models (LLMs) and human cognition, with highlights on both the capabilities of LLMs and their limitations in fully replicating human-like language understanding and generation. Key findings include the potential of LLMs to offer insights into human language processing, the increasing alignment between LLM behavior and human language processing when models are fine-tuned with human feedback, and the opportunities and challenges presented by human-AI collaboration in language tasks. By synthesizing these findings, this report aims to guide future research, development, and implementation of LLMs in cognitive psychology, linguistics, and education. It emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations and responsible use of AI technologies while striving to enhance human capabilities in text comprehension and production through effective human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Beyond Code: The Multidimensional Impacts of Large Language Models in Software Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are poised to significantly impact software development, especially in the Open-Source Software (OSS) sector. To understand this impact, we first outline the mechanisms through which LLMs may influence OSS through code development, collaborative knowledge transfer, and skill development. We then empirically examine how LLMs affect OSS developers' work in these three key areas. Leveraging a natural experiment from a temporary ChatGPT ban in Italy, we employ a Difference-in-Differences framework with two-way fixed effects to analyze data from all OSS developers on GitHub in three similar countries, Italy, France, and Portugal, totaling 88,022 users. We find that access to ChatGPT increases developer productivity by 6.4%, knowledge sharing by 9.6%, and skill acquisition by 8.4%. These benefits vary significantly by user experience level: novice developers primarily experience productivity gains, whereas more experienced developers benefit more from improved knowledge sharing and accelerated skill acquisition. In addition, we find that LLM-assisted learning is highly context-dependent, with the greatest benefits observed in technically complex, fragmented, or rapidly evolving contexts. We show that the productivity effects of LLMs extend beyond direct code generation to include enhanced collaborative learning and knowledge exchange among developers, dynamics that are essential for gaining a holistic understanding of LLMs' impact in OSS. Our findings offer critical managerial implications: strategically deploying LLMs can accelerate novice developers' onboarding and productivity, empower intermediate developers to foster knowledge sharing and collaboration, and support rapid skill acquisition, together enhancing long-term organizational productivity and agility.</description>

      <title>Listener-Rewarded Thinking in VLMs for Image Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training robust and generalizable reward models for human visual preferences is essential for aligning text-to-image and text-to-video generative models with human intent. However, current reward models often fail to generalize, and supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation pipelines. While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure mode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning trace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model ("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a listener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score, shaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer correctly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent model. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the ImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6% over naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong GRPO and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that listener-based rewards provide a scalable, data-efficient path to aligning vision-language models with nuanced human preferences. We will release our reasoning model here: https://huggingface.co/alexgambashidze/qwen2.5vl_image_preference_reasoner.</description>

      <title>Against 'softmaxing' culture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI is flattening culture. Evaluations of "culture" are showing the myriad ways in which large AI models are homogenizing language and culture, averaging out rich linguistic differences into generic expressions. I call this phenomenon "softmaxing culture,'' and it is one of the fundamental challenges facing AI evaluations today. Efforts to improve and strengthen evaluations of culture are central to the project of cultural alignment in large AI systems. This position paper argues that machine learning (ML) and human-computer interaction (HCI) approaches to evaluation are limited. I propose two key conceptual shifts. First, instead of asking "what is culture?" at the start of system evaluations, I propose beginning with the question: "when is culture?" Second, while I acknowledge the philosophical claim that cultural universals exist, the challenge is not simply to describe them, but to situate them in relation to their particulars. Taken together, these conceptual shifts invite evaluation approaches that move beyond technical requirements toward perspectives that are more responsive to the complexities of culture.</description>

      <title>Ovis-U1 Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this report, we introduce Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter unified model that integrates multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image editing capabilities. Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1 incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In text-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively. For image editing, it achieves 4.00 and 6.42 on the ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench-EN, respectively. As the initial version of the Ovis unified model series, Ovis-U1 pushes the boundaries of multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.</description>

      <title>Flow-Modulated Scoring for Semantic-Aware Knowledge Graph Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective modeling of multifaceted relations is pivotal for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC). However, a majority of existing approaches are predicated on static, embedding-based scoring, exhibiting inherent limitations in capturing contextual dependencies and relational dynamics. Addressing this gap, we propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework. FMS comprises two principal components: (1) a semantic context learning module that encodes context-sensitive entity representations, and (2) a conditional flow-matching module designed to learn the dynamic transformation from a head to a tail embedding, governed by the aforementioned context. The resultant predictive vector field, representing the context-informed relational path, serves to dynamically refine the initial static score of an entity pair. Through this synergy of context-aware static representations and conditioned dynamic information, FMS facilitates a more profound modeling of relational semantics. Comprehensive evaluations on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses prior state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>Pipelined Decoder for Efficient Context-Aware Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the basis of generative AI, an autoregressive model requires the generation of a new token depending on all the previously generated tokens, which brings high quality but also restricts the model to generate tokens one by one, forming a bottleneck limiting the generation speed. In this paper, we propose a new decoder architecture that efficiently generates text in parallel for context-aware generation tasks. Our proposed pipelined decoder initiates the generation of multiple subsequences simultaneously, and, at each time-step, it generates a new token for each subsequence to realize parallelism. Experiments on multiple text generation tasks, including question answering, text summarization, and keyphrase generation, show that our pipelined decoder significantly improves the generation speed without a significant loss of generation quality or additional memory consumption.</description>

      <title>ZonUI-3B: A Lightweight Vision-Language Model for Cross-Resolution GUI Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces ZonUI-3B, a lightweight Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for Graphical User Interface grounding tasks, achieving performance competitive with significantly larger models. Unlike large-scale VLMs (&gt;7B parameters) that are computationally intensive and impractical for consumer-grade hardware, ZonUI-3B delivers strong grounding accuracy while being fully trainable on a single GPU (RTX 4090). The model incorporates several key innovations: (i) combine cross-platform, multi-resolution dataset of 24K examples from diverse sources including mobile, desktop, and web GUI screenshots to effectively address data scarcity in high-resolution desktop environments; (ii) a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, where initial cross-platform training establishes robust GUI understanding, followed by specialized fine-tuning on high-resolution data to significantly enhance model adaptability; and (iii) data curation and redundancy reduction strategies, demonstrating that randomly sampling a smaller subset with reduced redundancy achieves performance comparable to larger datasets, emphasizing data diversity over sheer volume. Empirical evaluation on standard GUI grounding benchmarks-including ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and the challenging ScreenSpot-Pro, highlights ZonUI-3B's exceptional accuracy, achieving 84.9% on ScreenSpot and 86.4% on ScreenSpot-v2, surpassing prior models under 4B parameters. Ablation studies validate the critical role of balanced sampling and two-stage fine-tuning in enhancing robustness, particularly in high-resolution desktop scenarios. The ZonUI-3B is available at: https://github.com/Han1018/ZonUI-3B</description>

      <title>The Impact of AI on Educational Assessment: A Framework for Constructive Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and specifically Large Language Models (LLM), on education is continuously increasing. These models are frequently used by students, giving rise to the question whether current forms of assessment are still a valid way to evaluate student performance and comprehension. The theoretical framework developed in this paper is grounded in Constructive Alignment (CA) theory and Bloom's taxonomy for defining learning objectives. We argue that AI influences learning objectives of different Bloom levels in a different way, and assessment has to be adopted accordingly. Furthermore, in line with Bloom's vision, formative and summative assessment should be aligned on whether the use of AI is permitted or not.
  Although lecturers tend to agree that education and assessment need to be adapted to the presence of AI, a strong bias exists on the extent to which lecturers want to allow for AI in assessment. This bias is caused by a lecturer's familiarity with AI and specifically whether they use it themselves. To avoid this bias, we propose structured guidelines on a university or faculty level, to foster alignment among the staff. Besides that, we argue that teaching staff should be trained on the capabilities and limitations of AI tools. In this way, they are better able to adapt their assessment methods.</description>

      <title>Adapt Your Body: Mitigating Proprioception Shifts in Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning models for robotic tasks typically rely on multi-modal inputs, such as RGB images, language, and proprioceptive states. While proprioception is intuitively important for decision-making and obstacle avoidance, simply incorporating all proprioceptive states leads to a surprising degradation in imitation learning performance. In this work, we identify the underlying issue as the proprioception shift problem, where the distributions of proprioceptive states diverge significantly between training and deployment. To address this challenge, we propose a domain adaptation framework that bridges the gap by utilizing rollout data collected during deployment. Using Wasserstein distance, we quantify the discrepancy between expert and rollout proprioceptive states and minimize this gap by adding noise to both sets of states, proportional to the Wasserstein distance. This strategy enhances robustness against proprioception shifts by aligning the training and deployment distributions. Experiments on robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our method, enabling the imitation policy to leverage proprioception while mitigating its adverse effects. Our approach outperforms the naive solution which discards proprioception, and other baselines designed to address distributional shifts.</description>

      <title>Autonomy by Design: Preserving Human Autonomy in AI Decision-Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI systems increasingly support human decision-making across domains of professional, skill-based, and personal activity. While previous work has examined how AI might affect human autonomy globally, the effects of AI on domain-specific autonomy -- the capacity for self-governed action within defined realms of skill or expertise -- remain understudied. We analyze how AI decision-support systems affect two key components of domain-specific autonomy: skilled competence (the ability to make informed judgments within one's domain) and authentic value-formation (the capacity to form genuine domain-relevant values and preferences). By engaging with prior investigations and analyzing empirical cases across medical, financial, and educational domains, we demonstrate how the absence of reliable failure indicators and the potential for unconscious value shifts can erode domain-specific autonomy both immediately and over time. We then develop a constructive framework for autonomy-preserving AI support systems. We propose specific socio-technical design patterns -- including careful role specification, implementation of defeater mechanisms, and support for reflective practice -- that can help maintain domain-specific autonomy while leveraging AI capabilities. This framework provides concrete guidance for developing AI systems that enhance rather than diminish human agency within specialized domains of action.</description>
