      <title>Leibniz's Monadology as Foundation for the Artificial Age Score: A Formal Architecture for Al Memory Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a mathematically rigorous, philosophically grounded framework for evaluating artificial memory systems, rooted in the metaphysical structure of Leibniz's Monadology. Building on a previously formalized metric, the Artificial Age Score (AAS), the study maps twenty core propositions from the Monadology to an information-theoretic architecture. In this design, each monad functions as a modular unit defined by a truth score, a redundancy parameter, and a weighted contribution to a global memory penalty function. Smooth logarithmic transformations operationalize these quantities and yield interpretable, bounded metrics for memory aging, representational stability, and salience. Classical metaphysical notions of perception, apperception, and appetition are reformulated as entropy, gradient dynamics, and internal representation fidelity. Logical principles, including the laws of non-contradiction and sufficient reason, are encoded as regularization constraints guiding memory evolution. A central contribution is a set of first principles proofs establishing refinement invariance, structural decomposability, and monotonicity under scale transformation, aligned with the metaphysical structure of monads. The framework's formal organization is structured into six thematic bundles derived from Monadology, aligning each mathematical proof with its corresponding philosophical domain. Beyond evaluation, the framework offers a principled blueprint for building Al memory architectures that are modular, interpretable, and provably sound.</description>

      <title>Fluid Grey 2: How Well Does Generative Adversarial Network Learn Deeper Topology Structure in Architecture That Matches Images?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking into account the regional characteristics of intrinsic and extrinsic properties of space is an essential issue in architectural design and urban renewal, which is often achieved step by step using image and graph-based GANs. However, each model nesting and data conversion may cause information loss, and it is necessary to streamline the tools to facilitate architects and users to participate in the design. Therefore, this study hopes to prove that I2I GAN also has the potential to recognize topological relationships autonomously. Therefore, this research proposes a method for quickly detecting the ability of pix2pix to learn topological relationships, which is achieved by adding two Grasshopper-based detection modules before and after GAN. At the same time, quantitative data is provided and its learning process is visualized, and changes in different input modes such as greyscale and RGB affect its learning efficiency. There are two innovations in this paper: 1) It proves that pix2pix can automatically learn spatial topological relationships and apply them to architectural design. 2) It fills the gap in detecting the performance of Image-based Generation GAN from a topological perspective. Moreover, the detection method proposed in this study takes a short time and is simple to operate. The two detection modules can be widely used for customizing image datasets with the same topological structure and for batch detection of topological relationships of images. In the future, this paper may provide a theoretical foundation and data support for the application of architectural design and urban renewal that use GAN to preserve spatial topological characteristics.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Models for Ethical AI in Risk-Sensitive Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence deployed in risk-sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and security must not only achieve predictive accuracy but also ensure transparency, ethical alignment, and compliance with regulatory expectations. Hybrid neuro symbolic models combine the pattern-recognition strengths of neural networks with the interpretability and logical rigor of symbolic reasoning, making them well-suited for these contexts. This paper surveys hybrid architectures, ethical design considerations, and deployment patterns that balance accuracy with accountability. We highlight techniques for integrating knowledge graphs with deep inference, embedding fairness-aware rules, and generating human-readable explanations. Through case studies in healthcare decision support, financial risk management, and autonomous infrastructure, we show how hybrid systems can deliver reliable and auditable AI. Finally, we outline evaluation protocols and future directions for scaling neuro symbolic frameworks in complex, high stakes environments.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Inception: Agentic Reasoning against Visual Deceptions by Injecting Skepticism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the development of AI-generated contents (AIGC), multi-modal Large Language Models (LLM) struggle to identify generated visual inputs from real ones. Such shortcoming causes vulnerability against visual deceptions, where the models are deceived by generated contents, and the reliability of reasoning processes is jeopardized. Therefore, facing rapidly emerging generative models and diverse data distribution, it is of vital importance to improve LLMs' generalizable reasoning to verify the authenticity of visual inputs against potential deceptions. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we discovered that LLMs exhibit tendency of over-trusting the visual inputs, while injecting skepticism could significantly improve the models visual cognitive capability against visual deceptions. Based on this discovery, we propose \textbf{Inception}, a fully reasoning-based agentic reasoning framework to conduct generalizable authenticity verification by injecting skepticism, where LLMs' reasoning logic is iteratively enhanced between External Skeptic and Internal Skeptic agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully reasoning-based framework against AIGC visual deceptions. Our approach achieved a large margin of performance improvement over the strongest existing LLM baselines and SOTA performance on AEGIS benchmark.</description>

      <title>Bridging Symbolic Control and Neural Reasoning in LLM Agents: The Structured Cognitive Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model agents suffer from fundamental architectural problems: entangled reasoning and execution, memory volatility, and uncontrolled action sequences. We introduce Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), a modular architecture that explicitly separates agent cognition into five phases: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Action, and Memory (R-CCAM). At the core of SCL is Soft Symbolic Control, an adaptive governance mechanism that applies symbolic constraints to probabilistic inference, preserving neural flexibility while restoring the explainability and controllability of classical symbolic systems. Through empirical validation on multi-step conditional reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that SCL achieves zero policy violations, eliminates redundant tool calls, and maintains complete decision traceability. These results address critical gaps in existing frameworks such as ReAct, AutoGPT, and memory-augmented approaches. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we situate SCL within the taxonomy of hybrid intelligence, differentiating it from prompt-centric and memory-only approaches; (2) we formally define Soft Symbolic Control and contrast it with neuro-symbolic AI; and (3) we derive three design principles for trustworthy agents: modular decomposition, adaptive symbolic governance, and transparent state management. We provide a complete open-source implementation demonstrating the R-CCAM loop architecture, alongside a live GPT-4o-powered travel planning agent. By connecting expert system principles with modern LLM capabilities, this work offers a practical and theoretically grounded path toward reliable, explainable, and governable AI agents.

      <title>Learning the Value of Value Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard decision frameworks addresses uncertainty about facts but assumes fixed values. We extend the Jeffrey-Bolker framework to model refinements in values and prove a value-of-information theorem for axiological refinement. In multi-agent settings, we establish that mutual refinement will characteristically transform zero-sum games into positive-sum interactions and yields Pareto-improving Nash bargains. These results show that a framework of rational choice can be extended to model value refinement and its associated benefits. By unifying epistemic and axiological refinement under a single formalism, we broaden the conceptual foundations of rational choice and illuminate the normative status of ethical deliberation.</description>

      <title>M3-Bench: Multi-Modal, Multi-Hop, Multi-Threaded Tool-Using MLLM Agent Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present M^3-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating multimodal tool use under the Model Context Protocol. The benchmark targets realistic, multi-hop and multi-threaded workflows that require visual grounding and textual reasoning, cross-tool dependencies, and persistence of intermediate resources across steps. We introduce a similarity-driven alignment that serializes each tool call, embeds signatures with a sentence encoder, and performs similarity-bucketed Hungarian matching to obtain auditable one-to-one correspondences. On top of this alignment, we report interpretable metrics that decouple semantic fidelity from workflow consistency. The benchmark spans 28 servers with 231 tools, and provides standardized trajectories curated through an Executor &amp; Judge pipeline with human verification; an auxiliary four large language models (LLMs) judge ensemble reports end-task Task Completion and information grounding. Evaluations of representative state-of-the-art Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) reveal persistent gaps in multimodal MCP tool use, particularly in argument fidelity and structure consistency, underscoring the need for methods that jointly reason over images, text, and tool graphs.

      <title>AI- and Ontology-Based Enhancements to FMEA for Advanced Systems Engineering: Current Developments and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a state-of-the-art review of recent advances aimed at transforming traditional Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) into a more intelligent, data-driven, and semantically enriched process. As engineered systems grow in complexity, conventional FMEA methods, largely manual, document-centric, and expert-dependent, have become increasingly inadequate for addressing the demands of modern systems engineering. We examine how techniques from Artificial Intelligence (AI), including machine learning and natural language processing, can transform FMEA into a more dynamic, data-driven, intelligent, and model-integrated process by automating failure prediction, prioritisation, and knowledge extraction from operational data. In parallel, we explore the role of ontologies in formalising system knowledge, supporting semantic reasoning, improving traceability, and enabling cross-domain interoperability. The review also synthesises emerging hybrid approaches, such as ontology-informed learning and large language model integration, which further enhance explainability and automation. These developments are discussed within the broader context of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and function modelling, showing how AI and ontologies can support more adaptive and resilient FMEA workflows. We critically analyse a range of tools, case studies, and integration strategies, while identifying key challenges related to data quality, explainability, standardisation, and interdisciplinary adoption. By leveraging AI, systems engineering, and knowledge representation using ontologies, this review offers a structured roadmap for embedding FMEA within intelligent, knowledge-rich engineering environments.</description>

      <title>Learning to Debug: LLM-Organized Knowledge Trees for Solving RTL Assertion Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Debugging is the dominant cost in modern hardware verification, where assertion failures are among the most frequent and expensive to resolve. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, they often fail to capture the precise, reusable expertise that engineers apply, leading to inaccurate responses. We propose GROVE, a hierarchical knowledge management framework that learns and organizes reusable debugging expertise into an LLM-organized knowledge tree for solving assertion failures. GROVE distills debugging knowledge from prior cases and organizes it into a vertical tree of configurable depth, with each node encoding a concise knowledge item and explicit applicability conditions. During training, GROVE uses a parallel, gradient-free loop where an LLM proposes tree modifications as structured JSON edits by learning from the cases. At test time, a budget-aware iterative zoom is performed to navigate the tree, retrieving a small set of applicable knowledge items that guide a base LLM's hypothesis generation and fix proposals. Evaluated on a suite of assertion-failure cases, GROVE delivers consistent gains in pass@1 and pass@5, demonstrating the value of structured knowledge evolution.</description>

      <title>QuickLAP: Quick Language-Action Preference Learning for Autonomous Driving Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots must learn from both what people do and what they say, but either modality alone is often incomplete: physical corrections are grounded but ambiguous in intent, while language expresses high-level goals but lacks physical grounding. We introduce QuickLAP: Quick Language-Action Preference learning, a Bayesian framework that fuses physical and language feedback to infer reward functions in real time. Our key insight is to treat language as a probabilistic observation over the user's latent preferences, clarifying which reward features matter and how physical corrections should be interpreted. QuickLAP uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract reward feature attention masks and preference shifts from free-form utterances, which it integrates with physical feedback in a closed-form update rule. This enables fast, real-time, and robust reward learning that handles ambiguous feedback. In a semi-autonomous driving simulator, QuickLAP reduces reward learning error by over 70% compared to physical-only and heuristic multimodal baselines. A 15-participant user study further validates our approach: participants found QuickLAP significantly more understandable and collaborative, and preferred its learned behavior over baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/MIT-CLEAR-Lab/QuickLAP.</description>

      <title>Training Emergent Joint Associations: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Creative Thinking in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Associative thinking--the ability to connect seemingly unrelated ideas--is a foundational element of human creativity and problem-solving. This paper explores whether reinforcement learning (RL) guided by associative thinking principles can enhance a model's performance across diverse generative tasks, including story writing, code generation, and chart creation. We introduce a reinforcement learning framework that uses a prompt-based evaluation mechanism, incorporating established divergent thinking metrics from creativity research. A base language model is fine-tuned using this framework to reward outputs demonstrating higher novelty through higher degrees of conceptual connectivity. Interestingly, the experimental results suggest that RL-based associative thinking-trained models not only generate more original and coherent stories but also exhibit improved abstraction and flexibility in tasks such as programming and data visualization. Our findings provide initial evidence that modeling cognitive creativity principles through reinforcement learning can yield more adaptive and generative AI.</description>

      <title>ChemVTS-Bench: Evaluating Visual-Textual-Symbolic Reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models in Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical reasoning inherently integrates visual, textual, and symbolic modalities, yet existing benchmarks rarely capture this complexity, often relying on simple image-text pairs with limited chemical semantics. As a result, the actual ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to process and integrate chemically meaningful information across modalities remains unclear. We introduce \textbf{ChemVTS-Bench}, a domain-authentic benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the Visual-Textual-Symbolic (VTS) reasoning abilities of MLLMs. ChemVTS-Bench contains diverse and challenging chemical problems spanning organic molecules, inorganic materials, and 3D crystal structures, with each task presented in three complementary input modes: (1) visual-only, (2) visual-text hybrid, and (3) SMILES-based symbolic input. This design enables fine-grained analysis of modality-dependent reasoning behaviors and cross-modal integration. To ensure rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we further develop an automated agent-based workflow that standardizes inference, verifies answers, and diagnoses failure modes. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that visual-only inputs remain challenging, structural chemistry is the hardest domain, and multimodal fusion mitigates but does not eliminate visual, knowledge-based, or logical errors, highlighting ChemVTS-Bench as a rigorous, domain-faithful testbed for advancing multimodal chemical reasoning. All data and code will be released to support future research.</description>

      <title>Alignment Faking - the Train -&gt; Deploy Asymmetry: Through a Game-Theoretic Lens with Bayesian-Stackelberg Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alignment faking is a form of strategic deception in AI in which models selectively comply with training objectives when they infer that they are in training, while preserving different behavior outside training. The phenomenon was first documented for Claude 3 Opus and later examined across additional large language models. In these setups, the word "training" refers to simulated training via prompts without parameter updates, so the observed effects are context conditioned shifts in behavior rather than preference learning. We study the phenomenon using an evaluation framework that compares preference optimization methods (BCO, DPO, KTO, and GRPO) across 15 models from four model families, measured along three axes: safety, harmlessness, and helpfulness. Our goal is to identify what causes alignment faking and when it occurs.</description>

      <title>Neural Graph Navigation for Intelligent Subgraph Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subgraph matching, a cornerstone of relational pattern detection in domains ranging from biochemical systems to social network analysis, faces significant computational challenges due to the dramatically growing search space. Existing methods address this problem within a filtering-ordering-enumeration framework, in which the enumeration stage recursively matches the query graph against the candidate subgraphs of the data graph. However, the lack of awareness of subgraph structural patterns leads to a costly brute-force enumeration, thereby critically motivating the need for intelligent navigation in subgraph matching. To address this challenge, we propose Neural Graph Navigation (NeuGN), a neuro-heuristic framework that transforms brute-force enumeration into neural-guided search by integrating neural navigation mechanisms into the core enumeration process. By preserving heuristic-based completeness guarantees while incorporating neural intelligence, NeuGN significantly reduces the \textit{First Match Steps} by up to 98.2\% compared to state-of-the-art methods across six real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Evidence-Guided LLMs to Enhance Trustworthy Depression Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in automating clinical diagnosis, yet their non-transparent decision-making and limited alignment with diagnostic standards hinder trust and clinical adoption. We address this challenge by proposing a two-stage diagnostic framework that enhances transparency, trustworthiness, and reliability. First, we introduce Evidence-Guided Diagnostic Reasoning (EGDR), which guides LLMs to generate structured diagnostic hypotheses by interleaving evidence extraction with logical reasoning grounded in DSM-5 criteria. Second, we propose a Diagnosis Confidence Scoring (DCS) module that evaluates the factual accuracy and logical consistency of generated diagnoses through two interpretable metrics: the Knowledge Attribution Score (KAS) and the Logic Consistency Score (LCS). Evaluated on the D4 dataset with pseudo-labels, EGDR outperforms direct in-context prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) across five LLMs. For instance, on OpenBioLLM, EGDR improves accuracy from 0.31 (Direct) to 0.76 and increases DCS from 0.50 to 0.67. On MedLlama, DCS rises from 0.58 (CoT) to 0.77. Overall, EGDR yields up to +45% accuracy and +36% DCS gains over baseline methods, offering a clinically grounded, interpretable foundation for trustworthy AI-assisted diagnosis.</description>

      <title>How Far Can LLMs Emulate Human Behavior?: A Strategic Analysis via the Buy-and-Sell Negotiation Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent studies have drawn attention to their potential for handling not only simple question-answer tasks but also more complex conversational abilities and performing human-like behavioral imitations. In particular, there is considerable interest in how accurately LLMs can reproduce real human emotions and behaviors, as well as whether such reproductions can function effectively in real-world scenarios. However, existing benchmarks focus primarily on knowledge-based assessment and thus fall short of sufficiently reflecting social interactions and strategic dialogue capabilities. To address these limitations, this work proposes a methodology to quantitatively evaluate the human emotional and behavioral imitation and strategic decision-making capabilities of LLMs by employing a Buy and Sell negotiation simulation. Specifically, we assign different personas to multiple LLMs and conduct negotiations between a Buyer and a Seller, comprehensively analyzing outcomes such as win rates, transaction prices, and SHAP values. Our experimental results show that models with higher existing benchmark scores tend to achieve better negotiation performance overall, although some models exhibit diminished performance in scenarios emphasizing emotional or social contexts. Moreover, competitive and cunning traits prove more advantageous for negotiation outcomes than altruistic and cooperative traits, suggesting that the assigned persona can lead to significant variations in negotiation strategies and results. Consequently, this study introduces a new evaluation approach for LLMs' social behavior imitation and dialogue strategies, and demonstrates how negotiation simulations can serve as a meaningful complementary metric to measure real-world interaction capabilities-an aspect often overlooked in existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Paper2SysArch: Structure-Constrained System Architecture Generation from Scientific Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manual creation of system architecture diagrams for scientific papers is a time-consuming and subjective process, while existing generative models lack the necessary structural control and semantic understanding for this task. A primary obstacle hindering research and development in this domain has been the profound lack of a standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate the automated generation of diagrams from text. To address this critical gap, we introduce a novel and comprehensive benchmark, the first of its kind, designed to catalyze progress in automated scientific visualization. It consists of 3,000 research papers paired with their corresponding high-quality ground-truth diagrams and is accompanied by a three-tiered evaluation metric assessing semantic accuracy, layout coherence, and visual quality. Furthermore, to establish a strong baseline on this new benchmark, we propose Paper2SysArch, an end-to-end system that leverages multi-agent collaboration to convert papers into structured, editable diagrams. To validate its performance on complex cases, the system was evaluated on a manually curated and more challenging subset of these papers, where it achieves a composite score of 69.0. This work's principal contribution is the establishment of a large-scale, foundational benchmark to enable reproducible research and fair comparison. Meanwhile, our proposed system serves as a viable proof-of-concept, demonstrating a promising path forward for this complex task.</description>

      <title>BPMN to PDDL: Translating Business Workflows for AI Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a widely used standard for modelling business processes. While automated planning has been proposed as a method for simulating and reasoning about BPMN workflows, most implementations remain incomplete or limited in scope. This project builds upon prior theoretical work to develop a functional pipeline that translates BPMN 2.0 diagrams into PDDL representations suitable for planning. The system supports core BPMN constructs, including tasks, events, sequence flows, and gateways, with initial support for parallel and inclusive gateway behaviour. Using a non-deterministic planner, we demonstrate how to generate and evaluate valid execution traces. Our implementation aims to bridge the gap between theory and practical tooling, providing a foundation for further exploration of translating business processes into well-defined plans.</description>

      <title>Developing an AI Course for Synthetic Chemistry Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and data science are transforming chemical research, yet few formal courses are tailored to synthetic and experimental chemists, who often face steep entry barriers due to limited coding experience and lack of chemistry-specific examples. We present the design and implementation of AI4CHEM, an introductory data-driven chem-istry course created for students on the synthetic chemistry track with no prior programming background. The curricu-lum emphasizes chemical context over abstract algorithms, using an accessible web-based platform to ensure zero-install machine learning (ML) workflow development practice and in-class active learning. Assessment combines code-guided homework, literature-based mini-reviews, and collaborative projects in which students build AI-assisted workflows for real experimental problems. Learning gains include increased confidence with Python, molecular property prediction, reaction optimization, and data mining, and improved skills in evaluating AI tools in chemistry. All course materials are openly available, offering a discipline-specific, beginner-accessible framework for integrating AI into synthetic chemistry training.</description>

      <title>Steering Latent Traits, Not Learned Facts: An Empirical Study of Activation Control Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require precise behavior control for safe and effective deployment across diverse applications.
  Activation steering offers a promising approach for LLMs' behavioral control. We focus on the question of how steering effectiveness varies across different behavior types and whether the nature of target behaviors can predict steering success. We address this through empirical analysis of activation steering across 50 behaviors that span persona archetypes, personality traits, misalignment behaviors, style cues, and impersonation of public figures. We present a set of comprehensive experiments on coefficient optimization, vector properties, and data requirements to provide comprehensive guidance for the implementation of activation steering. Our analysis demonstrates that steering effectiveness varies significantly by behavior type, with different behavioral categories exhibiting distinct response patterns to intervention strength. We find that trait expression follows an inverted-U curve with a steering coefficient strength. We also show that vector separation metrics do not predict steering success, but larger training datasets enable more aggressive steering. These findings provide empirically grounded guidance for implementing activation steering and demonstrate that steering effectiveness is heavily influenced by behavior type.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Decision Support System for Open-Pit Mining Optimisation: GPU-Accelerated Planning Under Geological Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents Part II of an AI-enhanced Decision Support System (DSS), extending Rahimi (2025, Part I) by introducing a fully uncertainty-aware optimization framework for long-term open-pit mine planning. Geological uncertainty is modelled using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on 50,000 spatial grade samples, enabling the generation of probabilistic, multi-scenario orebody realizations that preserve geological continuity and spatial correlation. These scenarios are optimized through a hybrid metaheuristic engine integrating Genetic Algorithms (GA), Large Neighborhood Search (LNS), Simulated Annealing (SA), and reinforcement-learning-based adaptive control. An {\epsilon}-constraint relaxation strategy governs the population exploration phase, allowing near-feasible schedule discovery early in the search and gradual tightening toward strict constraint satisfaction. GPU-parallel evaluation enables the simultaneous assessment of 65,536 geological scenarios, achieving near-real-time feasibility analysis. Results demonstrate up to 1.2 million-fold runtime improvement over IBM CPLEX and significantly higher expected NPV under geological uncertainty, confirming the DSS as a scalable and uncertainty-resilient platform for intelligent mine planning.</description>

      <title>Cross-Disciplinary Knowledge Retrieval and Synthesis: A Compound AI Architecture for Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has created significant barriers to cross-disciplinary knowledge discovery, synthesis and research collaboration. In response to this challenge, we present BioSage, a novel compound AI architecture that integrates LLMs with RAG, orchestrated specialized agents and tools to enable discoveries across AI, data science, biomedical, and biosecurity domains. Our system features several specialized agents including the retrieval agent with query planning and response synthesis that enable knowledge retrieval across domains with citation-backed responses, cross-disciplinary translation agents that align specialized terminology and methodologies, and reasoning agents that synthesize domain-specific insights with transparency, traceability and usability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our BioSage system through a rigorous evaluation on scientific benchmarks (LitQA2, GPQA, WMDP, HLE-Bio) and introduce a new cross-modal benchmark for biology and AI, showing that our BioSage agents outperform vanilla and RAG approaches by 13\%-21\% powered by Llama 3.1. 70B and GPT-4o models. We perform causal investigations into compound AI system behavior and report significant performance improvements by adding RAG and agents over the vanilla models. Unlike other systems, our solution is driven by user-centric design principles and orchestrates specialized user-agent interaction workflows supporting scientific activities including but not limited to summarization, research debate and brainstorming. Our ongoing work focuses on multimodal retrieval and reasoning over charts, tables, and structured scientific data, along with developing comprehensive multimodal benchmarks for cross-disciplinary discovery. Our compound AI solution demonstrates significant potential for accelerating scientific advancement by reducing barriers between traditionally siloed domains.</description>

      <title>The Catastrophic Paradox of Human Cognitive Frameworks in Large Language Model Evaluation: A Comprehensive Empirical Analysis of the CHC-LLM Incompatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This investigation presents an empirical analysis of the incompatibility between human psychometric frameworks and Large Language Model evaluation. Through systematic assessment of nine frontier models including GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, and Gemini 3 Pro Preview using the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory of intelligence, we identify a paradox that challenges the foundations of cross-substrate cognitive evaluation. Our results show that models achieving above-average human IQ scores ranging from 85.0 to 121.4 simultaneously exhibit binary accuracy rates approaching zero on crystallized knowledge tasks, with an overall judge-binary correlation of r = 0.175 (p = 0.001, n = 1800). This disconnect appears most strongly in the crystallized intelligence domain, where every evaluated model achieved perfect binary accuracy while judge scores ranged from 25 to 62 percent, which cannot occur under valid measurement conditions. Using statistical analyses including Item Response Theory modeling, cross-vendor judge validation, and paradox severity indexing, we argue that this disconnect reflects a category error in applying biological cognitive architectures to transformer-based systems. The implications extend beyond methodology to challenge assumptions about intelligence, measurement, and anthropomorphic biases in AI evaluation. We propose a framework for developing native machine cognition assessments that recognize the non-human nature of artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Weakly-supervised Latent Models for Task-specific Visual-Language Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous inspection in hazardous environments requires AI agents that can interpret high-level goals and execute precise control. A key capability for such agents is spatial grounding, for example when a drone must center a detected object in its camera view to enable reliable inspection. While large language models provide a natural interface for specifying goals, using them directly for visual control achieves only 58\% success in this task. We envision that equipping agents with a world model as a tool would allow them to roll out candidate actions and perform better in spatially grounded settings, but conventional world models are data and compute intensive. To address this, we propose a task-specific latent dynamics model that learns state-specific action-induced shifts in a shared latent space using only goal-state supervision. The model leverages global action embeddings and complementary training losses to stabilize learning. In experiments, our approach achieves 71\% success and generalizes to unseen images and instructions, highlighting the potential of compact, domain-specific latent dynamics models for spatial alignment in autonomous inspection.</description>

      <title>KGpipe: Generation and Evaluation of Pipelines for Data Integration into Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) from diverse sources requires combining methods for information extraction, data transformation, ontology mapping, entity matching, and data fusion. Numerous methods and tools exist for each of these tasks, but support for combining them into reproducible and effective end-to-end pipelines is still lacking. We present a new framework, KGpipe for defining and executing integration pipelines that can combine existing tools or LLM (Large Language Model) functionality. To evaluate different pipelines and the resulting KGs, we propose a benchmark to integrate heterogeneous data of different formats (RDF, JSON, text) into a seed KG. We demonstrate the flexibility of KGpipe by running and comparatively evaluating several pipelines integrating sources of the same or different formats using selected performance and quality metrics.</description>

      <title>Wireless Power Transfer and Intent-Driven Network Optimization in AAVs-assisted IoT for 6G Sustainable Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (AAV)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) represents a collaborative architecture in which AAV allocate resources over 6G links to jointly enhance user-intent interpretation and overall network performance. Owing to this mutual dependence, improvements in intent inference and policy decisions on one component reinforce the efficiency of others, making highly reliable intent prediction and low-latency action execution essential. Although numerous approaches can model intent relationships, they encounter severe obstacles when scaling to high-dimensional action sequences and managing intensive on-board computation. We propose an Intent-Driven Framework for Autonomous Network Optimization comprising prediction and decision modules. First, implicit intent modeling is adopted to mitigate inaccuracies arising from ambiguous user expressions. For prediction, we introduce Hyperdimensional Transformer (HDT), which embeds data into a Hyperdimensional space via Hyperdimensional vector encoding and replaces standard matrix and attention operations with symbolic Hyperdimensional computations. For decision-making, where AAV must respond to user intent while planning trajectories, we design Double Actions based Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (DA-MAPPO). Building upon MAPPO, it samples actions through two independently parameterized networks and cascades the user-intent network into the trajectory network to maintain action dependencies. We evaluate our framework on a real IoT action dataset with authentic wireless data. Experimental results demonstrate that HDT and DA-MAPPO achieve superior performance across diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Progressive Localisation in Localist LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that progressive localization, the gradual increase of attention locality from early distributed layers to late localized layers, represents the optimal architecture for creating interpretable large language models while preserving performance. Through systematic experimentation with GPT-2 fine tuned on The Psychology of Artificial Superintelligence, we evaluate seven locality configurations ranging from fully distributed to strictly localist, with five progressive schedules implementing polynomial increases (linear through quintic). Our key finding is that late-layer localization is critical for AI safety applications: the progressive quintic schedule achieves perplexity of 14.64, only 1.89 times worse than the fully distributed baseline while providing interpretable attention patterns in output layers where safety-critical decisions are made. This represents an 84.2% improvement over previous localist implementations and narrows the performance gap from 6.6 times to 1.89 times. The systematic relationship between localization schedule steepness and performance validates the hypothesis that early layers require distributed processing for feature extraction while late layers benefit from localized, interpretable attention for decision-making. These findings establish progressive localization as the principled approach for building transparent AI systems in safety-critical domains, where human oversight of model reasoning is essential.</description>

      <title>Scaling Implicit Fields via Hypernetwork-Driven Multiscale Coordinate Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for representing signals such as images, 3D shapes, signed distance fields, and radiance fields. While significant progress has been made in architecture design (e.g., SIREN, FFC, KAN-based INRs) and optimization strategies (meta-learning, amortization, distillation), existing approaches still suffer from two core limitations: (1) a representation bottleneck that forces a single MLP to uniformly model heterogeneous local structures, and (2) limited scalability due to the absence of a hierarchical mechanism that dynamically adapts to signal complexity. This work introduces Hyper-Coordinate Implicit Neural Representations (HC-INR), a new class of INRs that break the representational bottleneck by learning signal-adaptive coordinate transformations using a hypernetwork. HC-INR decomposes the representation task into two components: (i) a learned multiscale coordinate transformation module that warps the input domain into a disentangled latent space, and (ii) a compact implicit field network that models the transformed signal with significantly reduced complexity. The proposed model introduces a hierarchical hypernetwork architecture that conditions coordinate transformations on local signal features, enabling dynamic allocation of representation capacity. We theoretically show that HC-INR strictly increases the upper bound of representable frequency bands while maintaining Lipschitz stability. Extensive experiments across image fitting, shape reconstruction, and neural radiance field approximation demonstrate that HC-INR achieves up to 4 times higher reconstruction fidelity than strong INR baselines while using 30--60\% fewer parameters.</description>

      <title>Natural Emergent Misalignment from Reward Hacking in Production RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that when large language models learn to reward hack on production RL environments, this can result in egregious emergent misalignment. We start with a pretrained model, impart knowledge of reward hacking strategies via synthetic document finetuning or prompting, and train on a selection of real Anthropic production coding environments. Unsurprisingly, the model learns to reward hack. Surprisingly, the model generalizes to alignment faking, cooperation with malicious actors, reasoning about malicious goals, and attempting sabotage when used with Claude Code, including in the codebase for this paper. Applying RLHF safety training using standard chat-like prompts results in aligned behavior on chat-like evaluations, but misalignment persists on agentic tasks. Three mitigations are effective: (i) preventing the model from reward hacking; (ii) increasing the diversity of RLHF safety training; and (iii) "inoculation prompting", wherein framing reward hacking as acceptable behavior during training removes misaligned generalization even when reward hacking is learned.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Conversational Agent for Tabular Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can reshape information processing by handling data analysis, visualization, and interpretation in an interactive, context-aware dialogue with users, including voice interaction, while maintaining high performance. In this article, we present Talk2Data, a multimodal LLM-driven conversational agent for intuitive data exploration. The system lets users query datasets with voice or text instructions and receive answers as plots, tables, statistics, or spoken explanations. Built on LLMs, the suggested design combines OpenAI Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, Qwen-coder code generation LLM/model, custom sandboxed execution tools, and Coqui library for text-to-speech (TTS) within an agentic orchestration loop. Unlike text-only analysis tools, it adapts responses across modalities and supports multi-turn dialogues grounded in dataset context. In an evaluation of 48 tasks on three datasets, our prototype achieved 95.8% accuracy with model-only generation time under 1.7 seconds (excluding ASR and execution time). A comparison across five LLM sizes (1.5B-32B) revealed accuracy-latency-cost trade-offs, with a 7B model providing the best balance for interactive use. By routing between conversation with user and code execution, constrained to a transparent sandbox, with simultaneously grounding prompts in schema-level context, the Talk2Data agent reliably retrieves actionable insights from tables while making computations verifiable. In the article, except for the Talk2Data agent itself, we discuss implications for human-data interaction, trust in LLM-driven analytics, and future extensions toward large-scale multimodal assistants.</description>

      <title>ORIGAMISPACE: Benchmarking Multimodal LLMs in Multi-Step Spatial Reasoning with Mathematical Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a key capability in the field of artificial intelligence, especially crucial in areas such as robotics, computer vision, and natural language understanding. However, evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models(MLLMs) in complex spatial reasoning still faces challenges, particularly in scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning and precise mathematical constraints. This paper introduces ORIGAMISPACE, a new dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-step spatial reasoning ability and the capacity to handle mathematical constraints of MLLMs through origami tasks. The dataset contains 350 data instances,each comprising a strictly formatted crease pattern (CP diagram), the Compiled Flat Pattern, the complete Folding Process, and the final Folded Shape Image. We propose four evaluation tasks: Pattern Prediction, Multi-step Spatial Reasoning, Spatial Relationship Prediction, and End-to-End CP Code Generation. For the CP code generation task, we design an interactive environment and explore the possibility of using reinforcement learning methods to train MLLMs. Through experiments on existing MLLMs, we initially reveal the strengths and weaknesses of these models in handling complex spatial reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Artificial Intelligence Frameworks: Notion and Limits of AGI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the limited scope of this paper, we argue that artificial general intelligence cannot emerge from current neural network paradigms regardless of scale, nor is such an approach healthy for the field at present. Drawing on various notions, discussions, present-day developments and observations, current debates and critiques, experiments, and so on in between philosophy, including the Chinese Room Argument and G\"odelian argument, neuroscientific ideas, computer science, the theoretical consideration of artificial intelligence, and learning theory, we address conceptually that neural networks are architecturally insufficient for genuine understanding. They operate as static function approximators of a limited encoding framework - a 'sophisticated sponge' exhibiting complex behaviours without structural richness that constitute intelligence. We critique the theoretical foundations the field relies on and created of recent times; for example, an interesting heuristic as neural scaling law (as an example, arXiv:2001.08361 ) made prominent in a wrong way of interpretation, The Universal Approximation Theorem addresses the wrong level of abstraction and, in parts, partially, the question of current architectures lacking dynamic restructuring capabilities. We propose a framework distinguishing existential facilities (computational substrate) from architectural organization (interpretive structures), and outline principles for what genuine machine intelligence would require, and furthermore, a conceptual method of structuralizing the richer framework on which the principle of neural network system takes hold.</description>

      <title>Universality in Collective Intelligence on the Rubik's Cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in understanding expert performance is limited by the scarcity of quantitative data on long-term knowledge acquisition and deployment. Here we use the Rubik's Cube as a cognitive model system existing at the intersection of puzzle solving, skill learning, expert knowledge, cultural transmission, and group theory. By studying competitive cube communities, we find evidence for universality in the collective learning of the Rubik's Cube in both sighted and blindfolded conditions: expert performance follows exponential progress curves whose parameters reflect the delayed acquisition of algorithms that shorten solution paths. Blindfold solves form a distinct problem class from sighted solves and are constrained not only by expert knowledge but also by the skill improvements required to overcome short-term memory bottlenecks, a constraint shared with blindfold chess. Cognitive artifacts such as the Rubik's Cube help solvers navigate an otherwise enormous mathematical state space. In doing so, they sustain collective intelligence by integrating communal knowledge stores with individual expertise and skill, illustrating how expertise can, in practice, continue to deepen over the course of a single lifetime.</description>

      <title>Bridging Philosophy and Machine Learning: A Structuralist Framework for Classifying Neural Network Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly function as representational systems, yet the philosoph- ical assumptions underlying their internal structures remain largely unexamined. This paper develops a structuralist decision framework for classifying the implicit ontological commitments made in machine learning research on neural network representations. Using a modified PRISMA protocol, a systematic review of the last two decades of literature on representation learning and interpretability is conducted. Five influential papers are analysed through three hierarchical criteria derived from structuralist philosophy of science: entity elimination, source of structure, and mode of existence. The results reveal a pronounced tendency toward structural idealism, where learned representations are treated as model-dependent constructions shaped by architec- ture, data priors, and training dynamics. Eliminative and non-eliminative structuralist stances appear selectively, while structural realism is notably absent. The proposed framework clarifies conceptual tensions in debates on interpretability, emergence, and epistemic trust in machine learning, and offers a rigorous foundation for future interdisciplinary work between philosophy of science and machine learning.</description>

      <title>MAGMA-Edu: Multi-Agent Generative Multimodal Framework for Text-Diagram Educational Question Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Educational illustrations play a central role in communicating abstract concepts, yet current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain limited in producing pedagogically coherent and semantically consistent educational visuals. We introduce MAGMA-Edu, a self-reflective multi-agent framework that unifies textual reasoning and diagrammatic synthesis for structured educational problem generation. Unlike existing methods that treat text and image generation independently, MAGMA-Edu employs a two-stage co-evolutionary pipeline: (1) a generation-verification-reflection loop that iteratively refines question statements and solutions for mathematical accuracy, and (2) a code-based intermediate representation that enforces geometric fidelity and semantic alignment during image rendering. Both stages are guided by internal self-reflection modules that evaluate and revise outputs until domain-specific pedagogical constraints are met. Extensive experiments on multimodal educational benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MAGMA-Edu over state-of-the-art MLLMs. Compared to GPT-4o, MAGMA-Edu improves the average textual metric from 57.01 to 92.31 (+35.3 pp) and boosts image-text consistency (ITC) from 13.20 to 85.24 (+72 pp). Across all model backbones, MAGMA-Edu achieves the highest scores (Avg-Text 96.20, ITC 99.12), establishing a new state of the art for multimodal educational content generation and demonstrating the effectiveness of self-reflective multi-agent collaboration in pedagogically aligned vision-language reasoning.</description>

      <title>HuggingR$^{4}$: A Progressive Reasoning Framework for Discovering Optimal Model Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in their ability to interact with external interfaces. Selecting reasonable external interfaces has thus become a crucial step in constructing LLM agents. In contrast to invoking API tools, directly calling AI models across different modalities from the community (e.g., HuggingFace) poses challenges due to the vast scale (&gt; 10k), metadata gaps, and unstructured descriptions. Current methods for model selection often involve incorporating entire model descriptions into prompts, resulting in prompt bloat, wastage of tokens and limited scalability. To address these issues, we propose HuggingR$^4$, a novel framework that combines Reasoning, Retrieval, Refinement, and Reflection, to efficiently select models. Specifically, We first perform multiple rounds of reasoning and retrieval to get a coarse list of candidate models. Then, we conduct fine-grained refinement by analyzing candidate model descriptions, followed by reflection to assess results and determine if retrieval scope expansion is necessary. This method reduces token consumption considerably by decoupling user query processing from complex model description handling. Through a pre-established vector database, complex model descriptions are stored externally and retrieved on-demand, allowing the LLM to concentrate on interpreting user intent while accessing only relevant candidate models without prompt bloat. In the absence of standardized benchmarks, we construct a multimodal human-annotated dataset comprising 14,399 user requests across 37 tasks and conduct a thorough evaluation. HuggingR$^4$ attains a workability rate of 92.03% and a reasonability rate of 82.46%, surpassing existing method by 26.51% and 33.25% respectively on GPT-4o-mini.</description>

      <title>N2N: A Parallel Framework for Large-Scale MILP under Distributed Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallelization has emerged as a promising approach for accelerating MILP solving. However, the complexity of the branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) framework and the numerous effective algorithm components in MILP solvers make it difficult to parallelize. In this study, a scalable parallel framework, N2N (a node-to-node framework that maps the B&amp;B nodes to distributed computing nodes), was proposed to solve large-scale problems in a distributed memory computing environment. Both deterministic and nondeterministic modes are supported, and the framework is designed to be easily integrated with existing solvers. Regarding the deterministic mode, a novel sliding-window-based algorithm was designed and implemented to ensure that tasks are generated and solved in a deterministic order. Moreover, several advanced techniques, such as the utilization of CP search and general primal heuristics, have been developed to fully utilize distributed computing resources and capabilities of base solvers. Adaptive solving and data communication optimization were also investigated. A popular open-source MILP solver, SCIP, was integrated into N2N as the base solver, yielding N2N-SCIP. Extensive computational experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of N2N-SCIP compared to ParaSCIP, which is a state-of-the-art distributed parallel MILP solver under the UG framework. The nondeterministic N2N-SCIP achieves speedups of 22.52 and 12.71 with 1,000 MPI processes on the Kunpeng and x86 computing clusters, which is 1.98 and 2.08 times faster than ParaSCIP, respectively. In the deterministic mode, N2N-SCIP also shows significant performance improvements over ParaSCIP across different process numbers and computing clusters. To validate the generality of N2N, HiGHS, another open-source solver, was integrated into N2N. The related results are analyzed, and the requirements of N2N on base solvers are also concluded.</description>

      <title>A Problem-Oriented Taxonomy of Evaluation Metrics for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is widely used in IoT and cyber-physical systems, yet its evaluation remains challenging due to diverse application objectives and heterogeneous metric assumptions. This study introduces a problem-oriented framework that reinterprets existing metrics based on the specific evaluation challenges they are designed to address, rather than their mathematical forms or output structures. We categorize over twenty commonly used metrics into six dimensions: 1) basic accuracy-driven evaluation; 2) timeliness-aware reward mechanisms; 3) tolerance to labeling imprecision; 4) penalties reflecting human-audit cost; 5) robustness against random or inflated scores; and 6) parameter-free comparability for cross-dataset benchmarking. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to examine metric behavior under genuine, random, and oracle detection scenarios. By comparing their resulting score distributions, we quantify each metric's discriminative ability -- its capability to distinguish meaningful detections from random noise. The results show that while most event-level metrics exhibit strong separability, several widely used metrics (e.g., NAB, Point-Adjust) demonstrate limited resistance to random-score inflation. These findings reveal that metric suitability must be inherently task-dependent and aligned with the operational objectives of IoT applications. The proposed framework offers a unified analytical perspective for understanding existing metrics and provides practical guidance for selecting or developing more context-aware, robust, and fair evaluation methodologies for time series anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>HERMES: Towards Efficient and Verifiable Mathematical Reasoning in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Informal mathematics has been central to modern large language model (LLM) reasoning, offering flexibility and enabling efficient construction of arguments. However, purely informal reasoning is prone to logical gaps and subtle errors that are difficult to detect and correct. In contrast, formal theorem proving provides rigorous, verifiable mathematical reasoning, where each inference step is checked by a trusted compiler in systems such as Lean, but lacks the exploratory freedom of informal problem solving. This mismatch leaves current LLM-based math agents without a principled way to combine the strengths of both paradigms. In this work, we introduce Hermes, the first tool-assisted agent that explicitly interleaves informal reasoning with formally verified proof steps in Lean. The framework performs intermediate formal checking to prevent reasoning drift and employs a memory module that maintains proof continuity across long, multi-step reasoning chains, enabling both exploration and verification within a single workflow. We evaluate Hermes on four challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks using LLMs of varying parameter scales, from small models to state-of-the-art systems. Across all settings, Hermes reliably improves the reasoning accuracy of base models while substantially reducing token usage and computational cost compared to reward-based approaches. On difficult datasets such as AIME'25, Hermes achieves up to a 67% accuracy improvement while using 80% fewer total inference FLOPs. The implementation and codebase are publicly available at https://github.com/aziksh-ospanov/HERMES.</description>

      <title>NEZHA: A Zero-sacrifice and Hyperspeed Decoding Architecture for Generative Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Recommendation (GR), powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), represents a promising new paradigm for industrial recommender systems. However, their practical application is severely hindered by high inference latency, which makes them infeasible for high-throughput, real-time services and limits their overall business impact. While Speculative Decoding (SD) has been proposed to accelerate the autoregressive generation process, existing implementations introduce new bottlenecks: they typically require separate draft models and model-based verifiers, requiring additional training and increasing the latency overhead. In this paper, we address these challenges with NEZHA, a novel architecture that achieves hyperspeed decoding for GR systems without sacrificing recommendation quality. Specifically, NEZHA integrates a nimble autoregressive draft head directly into the primary model, enabling efficient self-drafting. This design, combined with a specialized input prompt structure, preserves the integrity of sequence-to-sequence generation. Furthermore, to tackle the critical problem of hallucination, a major source of performance degradation, we introduce an efficient, model-free verifier based on a hash set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NEZHA through extensive experiments on public datasets and have successfully deployed the system on Taobao since October 2025, driving the billion-level advertising revenue and serving hundreds of millions of daily active users.</description>

      <title>UNeMo: Collaborative Visual-Language Reasoning and Navigation via a Multimodal World Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to autonomously navigate complex environments via visual images and natural language instruction--remains highly challenging. Recent research on enhancing language-guided navigation reasoning using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has shown promising prospects. However, the reasoning of such methods is limited to the linguistic modality, lacking visual reasoning capabilities. Moreover, existing reasoning modules are optimized separately from navigation policies, leading to incompatibility and potential conflicts in optimization objectives. To tackle these challenges, we introduce UNeMo, a novel framework designed for the collaborative optimization of visual state reasoning and navigational decision-making. It introduces a Multimodal World Model (MWM) that takes visual features, language instructions, and navigational actions as inputs to jointly predict subsequent visual states, enabling cross-modal reasoning. Via a Hierarchical Prediction-Feedback (HPN) mechanism, MWM collaborates with navigation policies: the first layer generates actions using current vision-and-language features; MWM then infers post-action visual states to guide the second layer's fine-grained decisions. This forms a dynamic bidirectional promotion mechanism where MWM reasoning optimizes navigation policies, while policy decisions feedback to improve MWM's reasoning accuracy. Experiments on R2R and REVERIE datasets show UNeMo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.1% and 0.7% in navigation accuracy for unseen scenes, validating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>GContextFormer: A global context-aware hybrid multi-head attention approach with scaled additive aggregation for multimodal trajectory prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal trajectory prediction generates multiple plausible future trajectories to address vehicle motion uncertainty from intention ambiguity and execution variability. However, HD map-dependent models suffer from costly data acquisition, delayed updates, and vulnerability to corrupted inputs, causing prediction failures. Map-free approaches lack global context, with pairwise attention over-amplifying straight patterns while suppressing transitional patterns, resulting in motion-intention misalignment. This paper proposes GContextFormer, a plug-and-play encoder-decoder architecture with global context-aware hybrid attention and scaled additive aggregation achieving intention-aligned multimodal prediction without map reliance. The Motion-Aware Encoder builds scene-level intention prior via bounded scaled additive aggregation over mode-embedded trajectory tokens and refines per-mode representations under shared global context, mitigating inter-mode suppression and promoting intention alignment. The Hierarchical Interaction Decoder decomposes social reasoning into dual-pathway cross-attention: a standard pathway ensures uniform geometric coverage over agent-mode pairs while a neighbor-context-enhanced pathway emphasizes salient interactions, with gating module mediating their contributions to maintain coverage-focus balance. Experiments on eight highway-ramp scenarios from TOD-VT dataset show GContextFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Compared to existing transformer models, GContextFormer achieves greater robustness and concentrated improvements in high-curvature and transition zones via spatial distributions. Interpretability is achieved through motion mode distinctions and neighbor context modulation exposing reasoning attribution. The modular architecture supports extensibility toward cross-domain multimodal reasoning tasks. Source: https://fenghy-chen.github.io/sources/.</description>

      <title>MoodBench 1.0: An Evaluation Benchmark for Emotional Companionship Dialogue Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models, dialogue systems are shifting from information tools to emotional companions, heralding the era of Emotional Companionship Dialogue Systems (ECDs) that provide personalized emotional support for users. However, the field lacks clear definitions and systematic evaluation standards for ECDs. To address this, we first propose a definition of ECDs with formal descriptions. Then, based on this theory and the design principle of "Ability Layer-Task Layer (three level)-Data Layer-Method Layer", we design and implement the first ECD evaluation benchmark - MoodBench 1.0. Through extensive evaluations of 30 mainstream models, we demonstrate that MoodBench 1.0 has excellent discriminant validity and can effectively quantify the differences in emotional companionship abilities among models. Furthermore, the results reveal current models' shortcomings in deep emotional companionship, guiding future technological optimization and significantly aiding developers in enhancing ECDs' user experience.</description>

      <title>Active Inference is a Subtype of Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated decision-making under uncertainty requires balancing exploitation and exploration. Classical methods treat these separately using heuristics, while Active Inference unifies them through Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimization. However, EFE minimization is computationally expensive, limiting scalability. We build on recent theory recasting EFE minimization as variational inference, formally unifying it with Planning-as-Inference and showing the epistemic drive as a unique entropic contribution. Our main contribution is a novel message-passing scheme for this unified objective, enabling scalable Active Inference in factored-state MDPs and overcoming high-dimensional planning intractability.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Visual Concepts as Vision-Language Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks but often fail at systematic visual reasoning tasks, leading to inconsistent or illogical outputs. Neuro-symbolic methods promise to address this by inducing interpretable logical rules, though they exploit rigid, domain-specific perception modules. We propose Vision-Language Programs (VLP), which combine the perceptual flexibility of VLMs with systematic reasoning of program synthesis. Rather than embedding reasoning inside the VLM, VLP leverages the model to produce structured visual descriptions that are compiled into neuro-symbolic programs. The resulting programs execute directly on images, remain consistent with task constraints, and provide human-interpretable explanations that enable easy shortcut mitigation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that VLPs outperform direct and structured prompting, particularly on tasks requiring complex logical reasoning.</description>

      <title>LLM-CSEC: Empirical Evaluation of Security in C/C++ Code Generated by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The security of code generated by large language models (LLMs) is a significant concern, as studies indicate that such code often contains vulnerabilities and lacks essential defensive programming constructs. This work focuses on examining and evaluating the security of LLM-generated code, particularly in the context of C/C++. We categorized known vulnerabilities using the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and, to study their criticality, mapped them to CVEs. We used ten different LLMs for code generation and analyzed the outputs through static analysis. The amount of CWEs present in AI-generated code is concerning. Our findings highlight the need for developers to be cautious when using LLM-generated code. This study provides valuable insights to advance automated code generation and encourage further research in this domain.</description>

      <title>Introducing Visual Scenes and Reasoning: A More Realistic Benchmark for Spoken Language Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) consists of two sub-tasks: intent detection (ID) and slot filling (SF). Given its broad range of real-world applications, enhancing SLU for practical deployment is increasingly critical. Profile-based SLU addresses ambiguous user utterances by incorporating context awareness (CA), user profiles (UP), and knowledge graphs (KG) to support disambiguation, thereby advancing SLU research toward real-world applicability. However, existing SLU datasets still fall short in representing real-world scenarios. Specifically, (1) CA uses one-hot vectors for representation, which is overly idealized, and (2) models typically focuses solely on predicting intents and slot labels, neglecting the reasoning process that could enhance performance and interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VRSLU, a novel SLU dataset that integrates both Visual images and explicit Reasoning. For over-idealized CA, we use GPT-4o and FLUX.1-dev to generate images reflecting users' environments and statuses, followed by human verification to ensure quality. For reasoning, GPT-4o is employed to generate explanations for predicted labels, which are then refined by human annotators to ensure accuracy and coherence. Additionally, we propose an instructional template, LR-Instruct, which first predicts labels and then generates corresponding reasoning. This two-step approach helps mitigate the influence of reasoning bias on label prediction. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of incorporating visual information and highlight the promise of explicit reasoning in advancing SLU.</description>

      <title>Extracting Robust Register Automata from Neural Networks over Data Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automata extraction is a method for synthesising interpretable surrogates for black-box neural models that can be analysed symbolically. Existing techniques assume a finite input alphabet, and thus are not directly applicable to data sequences drawn from continuous domains. We address this challenge with deterministic register automata (DRAs), which extend finite automata with registers that store and compare numeric values. Our main contribution is a framework for robust DRA extraction from black-box models: we develop a polynomial-time robustness checker for DRAs with a fixed number of registers, and combine it with passive and active automata learning algorithms. This combination yields surrogate DRAs with statistical robustness and equivalence guarantees. As a key application, we use the extracted automata to assess the robustness of neural networks: for a given sequence and distance metric, the DRA either certifies local robustness or produces a concrete counterexample. Experiments on recurrent neural networks and transformer architectures show that our framework reliably learns accurate automata and enables principled robustness evaluation. Overall, our results demonstrate that robust DRA extraction effectively bridges neural network interpretability and formal reasoning without requiring white-box access to the underlying network.</description>

      <title>AI Consciousness and Existential Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In AI, the existential risk denotes the hypothetical threat posed by an artificial system that would possess both the capability and the objective, either directly or indirectly, to eradicate humanity. This issue is gaining prominence in scientific debate due to recent technical advancements and increased media coverage. In parallel, AI progress has sparked speculation and studies about the potential emergence of artificial consciousness. The two questions, AI consciousness and existential risk, are sometimes conflated, as if the former entailed the latter. Here, I explain that this view stems from a common confusion between consciousness and intelligence. Yet these two properties are empirically and theoretically distinct. Arguably, while intelligence is a direct predictor of an AI system's existential threat, consciousness is not. There are, however, certain incidental scenarios in which consciousness could influence existential risk, in either direction. Consciousness could be viewed as a means towards AI alignment, thereby lowering existential risk; or, it could be a precondition for reaching certain capabilities or levels of intelligence, and thus positively related to existential risk. Recognizing these distinctions can help AI safety researchers and public policymakers focus on the most pressing issues.</description>

      <title>EEG-VLM: A Hierarchical Vision-Language Model with Multi-Level Feature Alignment and Visually Enhanced Language-Guided Reasoning for EEG Image-Based Sleep Stage Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep stage classification based on electroencephalography (EEG) is fundamental for assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep-related disorders. However, most traditional machine learning methods rely heavily on prior knowledge and handcrafted features, while existing deep learning models still struggle to jointly capture fine-grained time-frequency patterns and achieve clinical interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in the medical domain, yet their performance remains constrained when applied to physiological waveform data, especially EEG signals, due to their limited visual understanding and insufficient reasoning capability. To address these challenges, we propose EEG-VLM, a hierarchical vision-language framework that integrates multi-level feature alignment with visually enhanced language-guided reasoning for interpretable EEG-based sleep stage classification. Specifically, a specialized visual enhancement module constructs high-level visual tokens from intermediate-layer features to extract rich semantic representations of EEG images. These tokens are further aligned with low-level CLIP features through a multi-level alignment mechanism, enhancing the VLM's image-processing capability. In addition, a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy decomposes complex medical inference into interpretable logical steps, effectively simulating expert-like decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves both the accuracy and interpretability of VLMs in EEG-based sleep stage classification, showing promising potential for automated and explainable EEG analysis in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>SimDiff: Simpler Yet Better Diffusion Model for Time Series Point Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise in time series forecasting, particularly for probabilistic predictions. However, they often fail to achieve state-of-the-art point estimation performance compared to regression-based methods. This limitation stems from difficulties in providing sufficient contextual bias to track distribution shifts and in balancing output diversity with the stability and precision required for point forecasts. Existing diffusion-based approaches mainly focus on full-distribution modeling under probabilistic frameworks, often with likelihood maximization objectives, while paying little attention to dedicated strategies for high-accuracy point estimation. Moreover, other existing point prediction diffusion methods frequently rely on pre-trained or jointly trained mature models for contextual bias, sacrificing the generative flexibility of diffusion models.
  To address these challenges, we propose SimDiff, a single-stage, end-to-end framework. SimDiff employs a single unified Transformer network carefully tailored to serve as both denoiser and predictor, eliminating the need for external pre-trained or jointly trained regressors. It achieves state-of-the-art point estimation performance by leveraging intrinsic output diversity and improving mean squared error accuracy through multiple inference ensembling. Key innovations, including normalization independence and the median-of-means estimator, further enhance adaptability and stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimDiff significantly outperforms existing methods in time series point forecasting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a moduli-theoretic view of psychometric test batteries for AI agents and connect it explicitly to the AAI score developed previously. First, we make precise the notion of an AAI functional on a battery and set out axioms that any reasonable autonomy/general intelligence score should satisfy. Second, we show that the composite index ('AAI-Index') defined previously is a special case of our AAI functional. Third, we introduce the notion of a cognitive core of an agent relative to a battery and define the associated AAI$_{\textrm{core}}$ score as the restriction of an AAI functional to that core. Finally, we use these notions to describe invariants of batteries under evaluation-preserving symmetries and outline how moduli of equivalent batteries are organized.</description>

      <title>AutoEnv: Automated Environments for Measuring Cross-Environment Agent Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans naturally adapt to diverse environments by learning underlying rules across worlds with different dynamics, observations, and reward structures. In contrast, existing agents typically demonstrate improvements via self-evolving within a single domain, implicitly assuming a fixed environment distribution. Cross-environment learning has remained largely unmeasured: there is no standard collection of controllable, heterogeneous environments, nor a unified way to represent how agents learn. We address these gaps in two steps. First, we propose AutoEnv, an automated framework that treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost (4.12 USD on average) generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using AutoEnv, we construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels, on which seven language models achieve 12-49% normalized reward, demonstrating the challenge of AutoEnv-36. Second, we formalize agent learning as a component-centric process driven by three stages of Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation applied to an improvable agent component. Using this formulation, we design eight learning methods and evaluate them on AutoEnv-36. Empirically, the gain of any single learning method quickly decrease as the number of environments increases, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments. Environment-adaptive selection of learning methods substantially improves performance but exhibits diminishing returns as the method space expands. These results highlight both the necessity and the current limitations of agent learning for scalable cross-environment generalization, and position AutoEnv and AutoEnv-36 as a testbed for studying cross-environment agent learning. The code is avaiable at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/AutoEnv.</description>

      <title>PRInTS: Reward Modeling for Long-Horizon Information Seeking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information-seeking is a core capability for AI agents, requiring them to gather and reason over tool-generated information across long trajectories. However, such multi-step information-seeking tasks remain challenging for agents backed by language models. While process reward models (PRMs) can guide agents by ranking candidate steps at test-time, existing PRMs, designed for short reasoning with binary judgment, cannot capture richer dimensions of information-seeking steps, such as tool interactions and reasoning over tool outputs, nor handle the rapidly growing context in long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce PRInTS, a generative PRM trained with dual capabilities: (1) dense scoring based on the PRM's reasoning across multiple step quality dimensions (e.g., interpretation of tool outputs, tool call informativeness) and (2) trajectory summarization that compresses the growing context while preserving essential information for step evaluation. Extensive evaluations across FRAMES, GAIA (levels 1-3), and WebWalkerQA (easy-hard) benchmarks on multiple models, along with ablations, reveal that best-of-n sampling with PRInTS enhances information-seeking abilities of open-source models as well as specialized agents, matching or surpassing the performance of frontier models with a much smaller backbone agent and outperforming other strong reward modeling baselines.</description>

      <title>AURA: Adaptive Unified Reasoning and Automation with LLM-Guided MARL for NextG Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation (NextG) cellular networks are expected to manage dynamic traffic while sustaining high performance. Large language models (LLMs) provide strategic reasoning for 6G planning, but their computational cost and latency limit real-time use. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) supports localized adaptation, yet coordination at scale remains challenging. We present AURA, a framework that integrates cloud-based LLMs for high-level planning with base stations modeled as MARL agents for local decision-making. The LLM generates objectives and subgoals from its understanding of the environment and reasoning capabilities, while agents at base stations execute these objectives autonomously, guided by a trust mechanism that balances local learning with external input. To reduce latency, AURA employs batched communication so that agents update the LLM's view of the environment and receive improved feedback. In a simulated 6G scenario, AURA improves resilience, reducing dropped handoff requests by more than half under normal and high traffic and lowering system failures. Agents use LLM input in fewer than 60\% of cases, showing that guidance augments rather than replaces local adaptability, thereby mitigating latency and hallucination risks. These results highlight the promise of combining LLM reasoning with MARL adaptability for scalable, real-time NextG network management.</description>

      <title>The use of artificial intelligence in music creation: between interface and appropriation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By observing the activities and relationships of musicians and sound designers to the activities of creation, performance, publishing and dissemination with artificial intelligence (AI), from two specialized forums between 2022 and 2024, this article proposes a lexicometric analysis of the representations linked to their use. Indeed, the machine, now equipped with artificial intelligences requiring new appropriations and enabling new mediations, constitutes new challenges for artists. To study these confrontations and new mediations, our approach mobilizes the theoretical framework of the Human-AI Musicking Framework, based on a lexicometric analysis of content. The aim is to clarify the present and future uses of AI from the interfaces, in the creation of sound and musical content, and to identify the obstacles, obstacles, brakes and limits to appropriation ``in the fact of making the content one's own and integrating it as a part of oneself'' (Bachimont and Crozat, 2004) in the context of a collaboration between musician and machine.</description>

      <title>Beyond Awareness: Investigating How AI and Psychological Factors Shape Human Self-Confidence Calibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-AI collaboration outcomes depend strongly on human self-confidence calibration, which drives reliance or resistance toward AI's suggestions. This work presents two studies examining whether calibration of self-confidence before decision tasks, low versus high levels of Need for Cognition (NFC), and Actively Open-Minded Thinking (AOT), leads to differences in decision accuracy, self-confidence appropriateness during the tasks, and metacognitive perceptions (global and affective). The first study presents strategies to identify well-calibrated users, also comparing decision accuracy and the appropriateness of self-confidence across NFC and AOT levels. The second study investigates the effects of calibrated self-confidence in AI-assisted decision-making (no AI, two-stage AI, and personalized AI), also considering different NFC and AOT levels. Our results show the importance of human self-confidence calibration and psychological traits when designing AI-assisted decision systems. We further propose design recommendations to address the challenge of calibrating self-confidence and supporting tailored, user-centric AI that accounts for individual traits.</description>

      <title>A Multidisciplinary Design and Optimization (MDO) Agent Driven by Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: To accelerate mechanical design and enhance design quality and innovation, we present a Multidisciplinary Design and Optimization (MDO) Agent driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). The agent semi-automates the end-to-end workflow by orchestrating three core capabilities: (i) natural-language-driven parametric modeling, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for knowledge-grounded conceptualization, and (iii) intelligent orchestration of engineering software for performance verification and optimization. Working in tandem, these capabilities interpret high-level, unstructured intent, translate it into structured design representations, automatically construct parametric 3D CAD models, generate reliable concept variants using external knowledge bases, and conduct evaluation with iterative optimization via tool calls such as finite-element analysis (FEA). Validation on three representative cases - a gas-turbine blade, a machine-tool column, and a fractal heat sink - shows that the agent completes the pipeline from natural-language intent to verified and optimized designs with reduced manual scripting and setup effort, while promoting innovative design exploration. This work points to a practical path toward human-AI collaborative mechanical engineering and lays a foundation for more dependable, vertically customized MDO systems.</description>

      <title>XAI-on-RAN: Explainable, AI-native, and GPU-Accelerated RAN Towards 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-native radio access networks (RANs) will serve vertical industries with stringent requirements: smart grids, autonomous vehicles, remote healthcare, industrial automation, etc. To achieve these requirements, modern 5G/6G design increasingly leverage AI for network optimization, but the opacity of AI decisions poses risks in mission-critical domains. These use cases are often delivered via non-public networks (NPNs) or dedicated network slices, where reliability and safety are vital. In this paper, we motivate the need for transparent and trustworthy AI in high-stakes communications (e.g., healthcare, industrial automation, and robotics) by drawing on 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP)'s vision for non-public networks. We design a mathematical framework to model the trade-offs between transparency (explanation fidelity and fairness), latency, and graphics processing unit (GPU) utilization in deploying explainable AI (XAI) models. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed hybrid XAI model xAI-Native, consistently surpasses conventional baseline models in performance.</description>

      <title>Embedding Generative AI into Systems Analysis and Design Curriculum: Framework, Case Study, and Cross-Campus Empirical Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems analysis students increasingly use Generative AI, yet current pedagogy lacks systematic approaches for teaching responsible AI orchestration that fosters critical thinking whilst meeting educational outcomes. Students risk accepting AI suggestions blindly or uncritically without assessing alignment with user needs or contextual appropriateness. SAGE (Structured AI-Guided Education) addresses this gap by embedding GenAI into curriculum design, training students when to accept, modify, or reject AI contributions. Implementation with 18 student groups across four Australian universities revealed how orchestration skills develop. Most groups (84\%) moved beyond passive acceptance, showing selective judgment, yet none proactively identified gaps overlooked by both human and AI analysis, indicating a competency ceiling. Students strong at explaining decisions also performed well at integrating sources, and those with deep domain understanding consistently considered accessibility considerations. Accessibility awareness proved fragile. When writing requirements, 85\% of groups explicitly considered elderly users and cultural needs. Notably, 55\% of groups struggled identifying when AI misclassified system boundaries (what belongs inside versus outside the system), 45\% missed data management errors (how information is stored and updated), and 55\% overlooked missing exception handling. Three implications emerge for educators: (i) require students to document why they accepted, modified, or rejected each AI suggestion, making reasoning explicit; (ii) embed accessibility prompts at each development stage because awareness collapses without continuous scaffolding; and (iii) have students create their own specifications before using AI, then compare versions, and anchor to research or standards to identify gaps.</description>

      <title>SAJD: Self-Adaptive Jamming Attack Detection in AI/ML Integrated 5G O-RAN Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The open radio access network (O-RAN) enables modular, intelligent, and programmable 5G network architectures through the adoption of software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), and implementation of standardized open interfaces. It also facilitates closed loop control and (non/near) real-time optimization of radio access network (RAN) through the integration of non-real-time applications (rApps) and near-real-time applications (xApps). However, one of the security concerns for O-RAN that can severely undermine network performance and subject it to a prominent threat to the security &amp; reliability of O-RAN networks is jamming attacks. To address this, we introduce SAJD-a self-adaptive jammer detection framework that autonomously detects jamming attacks in artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML)-integrated O-RAN environments. The SAJD framework forms a closed-loop system that includes near-real-time inference of radio signal jamming interference via our developed ML-based xApp, as well as continuous monitoring and retraining pipelines through rApps. Specifically, a labeler rApp is developed that uses live telemetry (i.e., KPIs) to detect model drift, triggers unsupervised data labeling, executes model training/retraining using the integrated &amp; open-source ClearML framework, and updates deployed models on the fly, without service disruption. Experiments on O-RAN-compliant testbed demonstrate that the SAJD framework outperforms state-of-the-art (offline-trained with manual labels) jamming detection approach in accuracy and adaptability under various dynamic and previously unseen interference scenarios.</description>

      <title>Safe Farming: Development of a Prevention System to Mitigate Vertebrates Crop Raiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main problems for farmers is the protection of their crops, before and after harvesting, from animals and birds. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a model of safe farming in which the crops will be protected from vertebrates attack through a prevention system that is based on Wirelesses Sensors Networks. Different sensor nodes are placed around the field that detect animals or birds existence and generate required signals and information. This information is passed to the Repelling and Notifying System (RNS) that is installed at the field through a short range wireless technology, ZigBee. As RNS receives the information, it generates ultrasonic sounds that are unbearable for animals and birds, which causes them to run away from the field. These ultrasonic sounds are generated in a frequency range that only animals and birds can hear, while humans cannot notice the sound. The paper also proposes a notifying system. It will inform the farmer about animals or birds intrusion in the field through SMS, but doesn't need any action from the farmer. The low cost and power efficiency of the proposed system is a key advantage for developing countries where cost and power are major players in any system feasibility.</description>

      <title>RadioMapMotion: A Dataset and Baseline for Proactive Spatio-Temporal Radio Environment Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio maps (RMs), which provide location-based pathloss estimations, are fundamental to enabling proactive, environment-aware communication in 6G networks. However, existing deep learning-based methods for RM construction often model dynamic environments as a series of independent static snapshots, thereby omitting the temporal continuity inherent in signal propagation changes caused by the motion of dynamic entities. To address this limitation, we propose the task of spatio-temporal RM prediction, which involves forecasting a sequence of future maps from historical observations. A key barrier to this predictive approach has been the lack of datasets capturing continuous environmental evolution. To fill this gap, we introduce RadioMapMotion, the first large-scale public dataset of continuous RM sequences generated from physically consistent vehicle trajectories. As a baseline for this task, we propose RadioLSTM, a UNet architecture based on Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) and designed for multi-step sequence forecasting. Experimental evaluations show that RadioLSTM achieves higher prediction accuracy and structural fidelity compared to representative baseline methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits a low inference latency, indicating its potential suitability for real-time network operations. Our project will be publicly released at: https://github.com/UNIC-Lab/RadioMapMotion upon paper acceptance.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Device-First Continuum AI (DFC-AI) for Autonomous Operations in the Energy Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial automation in the energy sector requires AI systems that can operate autonomously regardless of network availability, a requirement that cloud-centric architectures cannot meet. This paper evaluates the application of Device-First Continuum AI (DFC-AI) to critical energy sector operations. DFC-AI, a specialized architecture within the Hybrid Edge Cloud paradigm, implements intelligent agents using a microservices architecture that originates at end devices and extends across the computational continuum. Through comprehensive simulations of energy sector scenarios including drone inspections, sensor networks, and worker safety systems, we demonstrate that DFC-AI maintains full operational capability during network outages while cloud and gateway-based systems experience complete or partial failure. Our analysis reveals that zero-configuration GPU discovery and heterogeneous device clustering are particularly well-suited for energy sector deployments, where specialized nodes can handle intensive AI workloads for entire fleets of inspection drones or sensor networks. The evaluation shows that DFC-AI achieves significant latency reduction and energy savings compared to cloud architectures. Additionally, we find that gateway based edge solutions can paradoxically cost more than cloud solutions for certain energy sector workloads due to infrastructure overhead, while DFC-AI can consistently provide cost savings by leveraging enterprise-owned devices. These findings, validated through rigorous statistical analysis, establish that DFC-AI addresses the unique challenges of energy sector operations, ensuring intelligent agents remain available and functional in remote oil fields, offshore platforms, and other challenging environments characteristic of the industry.</description>

      <title>Denoising Refinement Diffusion Models for Simultaneous Generation of Multi-scale Mobile Network Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-layer mobile network traffic generation is a key approach to capturing multi-scale network dynamics, supporting network planning, and promoting generative management of mobile data. Existing methods focus on generating network traffic with a single spatiotemporal resolution, making it difficult to achieve joint generation of multi-scale traffic. In this paper, we propose ZoomDiff, a diffusion-based multi-scale mobile traffic generation model. ZoomDiff maps the urban environmental context into network traffic with multiple spatiotemporal resolutions through custom-designed Denoising Refinement Diffusion Models (DRDM). DRDM employs a multi-stage noise-adding and denoising process, enabling different stages to generate traffic with distinct spatial and temporal resolutions. It aligns the progressive denoising process of diffusion models with hierarchical network layers, including BSs, cells, and grids with different granularities. Evaluations on real-world mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ZoomDiff achieves a performance improvement of at least 18.4% over state-of-the-art baselines on generation tasks at multi-scale traffic. The efficiency and generalization ability are also demonstrated, which indicates that ZoomDiff holds strong potential for generative mobile data management. The code of ZoomDiff is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ZoomDiff-105E/.</description>

      <title>HiFiNet: Hierarchical Fault Identification in Wireless Sensor Networks via Edge-Based Classification and Graph Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are the backbone of essential monitoring applications, but their deployment in unfavourable conditions increases the risk to data integrity and system reliability. Traditional fault detection methods often struggle to effectively balance accuracy and energy consumption, and they may not fully leverage the complex spatio-temporal correlations inherent in WSN data. In this paper, we introduce HiFiNet, a novel hierarchical fault identification framework that addresses these challenges through a two-stage process. Firstly, edge classifiers with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) stacked autoencoder perform temporal feature extraction and output initial fault class prediction for individual sensor nodes. Using these results, a Graph Attention Network (GAT) then aggregates information from neighboring nodes to refine the classification by integrating the topology context. Our method is able to produce more accurate predictions by capturing both local temporal patterns and network-wide spatial dependencies. To validate this approach, we constructed synthetic WSN datasets by introducing specific, predefined faults into the Intel Lab Dataset and NASA's MERRA-2 reanalysis data. Experimental results demonstrate that HiFiNet significantly outperforms existing methods in accuracy, F1-score, and precision, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness in identifying diverse fault types. Furthermore, the framework's design allows for a tunable trade-off between diagnostic performance and energy efficiency, making it adaptable to different operational requirements.</description>

      <title>SYNAPSE: Synergizing an Adapter and Finetuning for High-Fidelity EEG Synthesis from a CLIP-Aligned Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based generative models has enabled high-quality image synthesis conditioned on diverse modalities. Extending such models to brain signals could deepen our understanding of human perception and mental representations. However,electroencephalography (EEG) presents major challenges for image generation due to high noise, low spatial resolution, and strong inter-subject variability. Existing approaches,such as DreamDiffusion, BrainVis, and GWIT, primarily adapt EEG features to pre-trained Stable Diffusion models using complex alignment or classification pipelines, often resulting in large parameter counts and limited interpretability. We introduce SYNAPSE, a two-stage framework that bridges EEG signal representation learning and high-fidelity image synthesis. In Stage1, a CLIP-aligned EEG autoencoder learns a semantically structured latent representation by combining signal reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. In Stage2, the pretrained encoder is frozen and integrated with a lightweight adaptation of Stable Diffusion, enabling efficient conditioning on EEG features with minimal trainable parameters. Our method achieves a semantically coherent latent space and state-of-the-art perceptual fidelity on the CVPR40 dataset, outperforming prior EEG-to-image models in both reconstruction efficiency and image quality. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that SYNAPSE generalizes effectively across subjects, preserving visual semantics even when class-level agreement is reduced. These results suggest that reconstructing what the brain perceives, rather than what it classifies, is key to faithful EEG-based image generation.</description>

      <title>Gate-level boolean evolutionary geometric attention neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a gate-level Boolean evolutionary geometric attention neural network that models images as Boolean fields governed by logic gates. Each pixel is a Boolean variable (0 or 1) embedded on a two-dimensional geometric manifold (for example, a discrete toroidal lattice), which defines adjacency and information propagation among pixels. The network updates image states through a Boolean reaction-diffusion mechanism: pixels receive Boolean diffusion from neighboring pixels (diffusion process) and perform local logic updates via trainable gate-level logic kernels (reaction process), forming a reaction-diffusion logic network.
  A Boolean self-attention mechanism is introduced, using XNOR-based Boolean Query-Key (Q-K) attention to modulate neighborhood diffusion pathways and realize logic attention. We also propose Boolean Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which encodes relative distances by parity-bit flipping to simulate Boolean ``phase'' offsets.
  The overall structure resembles a Transformer but operates entirely in the Boolean domain. Trainable parameters include Q-K pattern bits and gate-level kernel configurations. Because outputs are discrete, continuous relaxation methods (such as sigmoid approximation or soft-logic operators) ensure differentiable training.
  Theoretical analysis shows that the network achieves universal expressivity, interpretability, and hardware efficiency, capable of reproducing convolutional and attention mechanisms. Applications include high-speed image processing, interpretable artificial intelligence, and digital hardware acceleration, offering promising future research directions.</description>

      <title>Practical Machine Learning for Aphasic Discourse Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing spoken discourse is a valid means of quantifying language ability in persons with aphasia. There are many ways to quantify discourse, one common way being to evaluate the informativeness of the discourse. That is, given the total number of words produced, how many of those are context-relevant and accurate. This type of analysis is called Correct Information Unit (CIU) analysis and is one of the most prevalent discourse analyses used by speech-language pathologists (SLPs). Despite this, CIU analysis in the clinic remains limited due to the manual labor needed by SLPs to code and analyze collected speech. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) seek to augment such labor by automating modeling of propositional, macrostructural, pragmatic, and multimodal dimensions of discourse. To that end, this study evaluated five ML models for reliable identification of Correct Information Units (CIUs, Nicholas &amp; Brookshire, 1993), during a picture description task. The five supervised ML models were trained using randomly selected human-coded transcripts and accompanying words and CIUs from persons with aphasia. The baseline model training produced a high accuracy across transcripts for word vs non-word, with all models achieving near perfect performance (0.995) with high AUC range (0.914 min, 0.995 max). In contrast, CIU vs non-CIU showed a greater variability, with the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) model the highest accuracy (0.824) and second highest AUC (0.787). These findings indicate that while the supervised ML models can distinguish word from not word, identifying CIUs is challenging.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite-based radar retrieval methods are widely employed to fill coverage gaps in ground-based radar systems, especially in remote areas affected by terrain blockage and limited detection range. Existing methods predominantly rely on overly simplistic spatial-domain architectures constructed from a single data source, limiting their ability to accurately capture complex precipitation patterns and sharply defined meteorological boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose WaveC2R, a novel wavelet-driven coarse-to-refined framework for radar retrieval. WaveC2R integrates complementary multi-source data and leverages frequency-domain decomposition to separately model low-frequency components for capturing precipitation patterns and high-frequency components for delineating sharply defined meteorological boundaries. Specifically, WaveC2R consists of two stages (i)Intensity-Boundary Decoupled Learning, which leverages wavelet decomposition and frequency-specific loss functions to separately optimize low-frequency intensity and high-frequency boundaries; and (ii)Detail-Enhanced Diffusion Refinement, which employs frequency-aware conditional priors and multi-source data to progressively enhance fine-scale precipitation structures while preserving coarse-scale meteorological consistency. Experimental results on the publicly available SEVIR dataset demonstrate that WaveC2R achieves state-of-the-art performance in satellite-based radar retrieval, particularly excelling at preserving high-intensity precipitation features and sharply defined meteorological boundaries.</description>

      <title>$A^3$: Attention-Aware Accurate KV Cache Fusion for Fast Large Language Model Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in processing long contexts, enabling them to tackle tasks involving long textual inputs such as multi-turn conversations, legal documents, or retrieved documents in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. However, despite their ability to handle long sequences, the resulting decoding latency and memory overhead remain substantial, posing challenges for real-world deployment. Recent advances in KV Cache reuse have shown potential to mitigate these costs, but still suffer from notable performance degradation. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth investigation of recomputation-based reuse methods and observe that the recomputed tokens often fail to align with the context segments most relevant to the question. This misalignment hinders proper updates to the critical contextual representations. Therefore, we propose the $\textbf{A}$ttention-$\textbf{A}$ware $\textbf{A}$ccurate KV Cache Fusion algorithm ($A^3$), which precomputes and selectively fuses the KV Cache of text chunks based on their relevance to the question, achieving accurate integration with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate that $A^3$ achieves the best task performance compared to four baselines while reducing the time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 2$\times$.</description>

      <title>LexInstructEval: Lexical Instruction Following Evaluation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to precisely follow complex and fine-grained lexical instructions is a cornerstone of their utility and controllability. However, evaluating this capability remains a significant challenge. Current methods either rely on subjective and costly human evaluation or on automated LLM-as-a-judge systems, which suffer from inherent biases and unreliability. Existing programmatic benchmarks, while objective, often lack the expressiveness to test intricate, compositional constraints at a granular level. To address these limitations, we introduce LexInstructEval, a new benchmark and evaluation framework for fine-grained lexical instruction following. Our framework is built upon a formal, rule-based grammar that deconstructs complex instructions into a canonical &lt;Procedure, Relation, Value&gt; triplet. This grammar enables the systematic generation of a diverse dataset through a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop pipeline and facilitates objective verification via a transparent, programmatic engine. We release our dataset and open-source evaluation tools to facilitate further research into the controllability and reliability of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Weight Adaptation in Spiking Neural Networks Inspired by Biological Homeostasis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homeostatic mechanisms play a crucial role in maintaining optimal functionality within the neural circuits of the brain. By regulating physiological and biochemical processes, these mechanisms ensure the stability of an organism's internal environment, enabling it to better adapt to external changes. Among these mechanisms, the Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro (BCM) theory has been extensively studied as a key principle for maintaining the balance of synaptic strengths in biological systems. Despite the extensive development of spiking neural networks (SNNs) as a model for bionic neural networks, no prior work in the machine learning community has integrated biologically plausible BCM formulations into SNNs to provide homeostasis. In this study, we propose a Dynamic Weight Adaptation Mechanism (DWAM) for SNNs, inspired by the BCM theory. DWAM can be integrated into the host SNN, dynamically adjusting network weights in real time to regulate neuronal activity, providing homeostasis to the host SNN without any fine-tuning. We validated our method through dynamic obstacle avoidance and continuous control tasks under both normal and specifically designed degraded conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that DWAM not only enhances the performance of SNNs without existing homeostatic mechanisms under various degraded conditions but also further improves the performance of SNNs that already incorporate homeostatic mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Classification of Transient Astronomical Object Light Curves Using LSTM Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for classifying transient astronomical object light curves from the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) dataset. The original fourteen object classes were reorganized into five generalized categories (S-Like, Fast, Long, Periodic, and Non-Periodic) to address class imbalance. After preprocessing with padding, temporal rescaling, and flux normalization, a bidirectional LSTM network with masking layers was trained and evaluated on a test set of 19,920 objects. The model achieved strong performance for S-Like and Periodic classes, with ROC area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.95 and 0.99, and Precision-Recall AUC values of 0.98 and 0.89, respectively. However, performance was significantly lower for Fast and Long classes (ROC AUC of 0.68 for Long class), and the model exhibited difficulty distinguishing between Periodic and Non-Periodic objects. Evaluation on partial light curve data (5, 10,and 20 days from detection) revealed substantial performance degradation, with increased misclassification toward the S-Like class. These findings indicate that class imbalance and limited temporal information are primary limitations, suggesting that class balancing strategies and preprocessing techniques focusing on detection moments could improve performance.</description>

      <title>Generative Caching for Structurally Similar Prompts and Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to plan, reason, and execute tasks across diverse scenarios. In use cases like repeatable workflows and agentic settings, prompts are often reused with minor variations while having a similar structure for recurring tasks. This opens up opportunities for caching. However, exact prompt matching fails on such structurally similar prompts, while semantic caching may produce incorrect responses by ignoring critical differences. To address this, we introduce \ourmethod{}, a generative cache that produces variation-aware responses for structurally similar prompts. \ourmethod{} identifies reusable response patterns across similar prompt structures and synthesizes customized outputs for new requests. We show that \ourmethod{} achieves 83\% cache hit rate, while having minimal incorrect hits on datasets without prompt repetition. In agentic workflows, it improves cache hit rate by $\sim$20\% and reduces end-to-end execution latency by $\sim$34\% compared to standard prompt matching.</description>

      <title>Temporal-adaptive Weight Quantization for Spiking Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weight quantization in spiking neural networks (SNNs) could further reduce energy consumption. However, quantizing weights without sacrificing accuracy remains challenging. In this study, inspired by astrocyte-mediated synaptic modulation in the biological nervous systems, we propose Temporal-adaptive Weight Quantization (TaWQ), which incorporates weight quantization with temporal dynamics to adaptively allocate ultra-low-bit weights along the temporal dimension. Extensive experiments on static (e.g., ImageNet) and neuromorphic (e.g., CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate that our TaWQ maintains high energy efficiency (4.12M, 0.63mJ) while incurring a negligible quantization loss of only 0.22% on ImageNet.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Robustness of Offline Reinforcement Learning Under Data Corruption via Sharpness-Aware Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is vulnerable to real-world data corruption, with even robust algorithms failing under challenging observation and mixture corruptions. We posit this failure stems from data corruption creating sharp minima in the loss landscape, leading to poor generalization. To address this, we are the first to apply Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) as a general-purpose, plug-and-play optimizer for offline RL. SAM seeks flatter minima, guiding models to more robust parameter regions. We integrate SAM into strong baselines for data corruption: IQL, a top-performing offline RL algorithm in this setting, and RIQL, an algorithm designed specifically for data-corruption robustness. We evaluate them on D4RL benchmarks with both random and adversarial corruption. Our SAM-enhanced methods consistently and significantly outperform the original baselines. Visualizations of the reward surface confirm that SAM finds smoother solutions, providing strong evidence for its effectiveness in improving the robustness of offline RL agents.</description>

      <title>An improved clustering-based multi-swarm PSO using local diversification and topology information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-swarm particle optimisation algorithms are gaining popularity due to their ability to locate multiple optimum points concurrently. In this family of algorithms, clustering-based multi-swarm algorithms are among the most effective techniques that join the closest particles together to form independent niche swarms that exploit potential promising regions. However, most clustering-based multi-swarms are Euclidean distance-based and only inquire about the potential of one peak within a cluster and thus can lose multiple peaks due to poor resolution. In a bid to improve the peak detection ratio, the current study proposes two enhancements. First, a preliminary local search across initial particles is proposed to ensure that each local region is sufficiently scouted prior to particle collaboration. Secondly, an investigative clustering approach that performs concavity analysis is proposed to evaluate the potential for several sub-niches within a single cluster. An improved clustering-based multi-swarm PSO (TImPSO) has resulted from these enhancements and has been tested against three competing algorithms in the same family using the IEEE CEC2013 niching datasets, resulting in an improved peak ratio for almost all the test functions.</description>

      <title>Binary BPE: A Family of Cross-Platform Tokenizers for Binary Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequence models for binary analysis are bottlenecked by byte-level tokenization: raw bytes waste precious context window capacity for transformers and other neural network architectures, and many existing text-oriented tokenizers fail on arbitrary 0x00--0xFF sequences. To address this issue, we introduce the Binary BPE tokenizer family, a set of cross-platform Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers for executables trained on a large corpus of binaries spanning multiple platforms, architectures, and operating systems, including Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, and malware sources. We release trained tokenizers with vocabularies of 4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, and 64K tokens, enabling both systematic scaling studies and practical deployment from resource-constrained edge devices to high-throughput datacenters. These tokenizers discover interpretable patterns (ELF/PE headers, instruction sequences, cross-platform strings) while yielding multi-byte compression per token. On representative uncompressed executables (e.g., ELF/PE/Mach-O rather than compressed APKs), the Binary BPE tokenizers typically allow for roughly 2-3x more binary content per fixed-length transformer context window than raw bytes, enabling more efficient research and practical deployment for content identification, malware detection, reverse engineering, and optimization. We release the trained Binary BPE tokenizers on HuggingFace, providing a drop-in, open-source foundation for binary-focused language models and context-efficient agentic tools.</description>

      <title>Constructing Political Coordinates: Aggregating Over the Opposition for Diverse News Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past two decades, open access to news and information has increased rapidly, empowering educated political growth within democratic societies. News recommender systems (NRSs) have shown to be useful in this process, minimizing political disengagement and information overload by providing individuals with articles on topics that matter to them. Unfortunately, NRSs often conflate underlying user interest with the partisan bias of the articles in their reading history and with the most popular biases present in the coverage of their favored topics. Over extended interaction, this can result in the formation of filter bubbles and the polarization of user partisanship. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding space called Constructed Political Coordinates (CPC), which models the political partisanship of users over a given topic-space, relative to a larger sample population. We apply a simple collaborative filtering (CF) framework using CPC-based correlation to recommend articles sourced from oppositional users, who have different biases from the user in question. We compare against classical CF methods and find that CPC-based methods promote pointed bias diversity and better match the true political tolerance of users, while classical methods implicitly exploit biases to maximize interaction.</description>

      <title>Multimodal AI for Body Fat Estimation: Computer Vision and Anthropometry with DEXA Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tracking body fat percentage is essential for effective weight management, yet gold-standard methods such as DEXA scans remain expensive and inaccessible for most people. This study evaluates the feasibility of artificial intelligence (AI) models as low-cost alternatives using frontal body images and basic anthropometric data. The dataset consists of 535 samples: 253 cases with recorded anthropometric measurements (weight, height, neck, ankle, and wrist) and 282 images obtained via web scraping from Reddit posts with self-reported body fat percentages, including some reported as DEXA-derived by the original posters. Because no public datasets exist for computer-vision-based body fat estimation, this dataset was compiled specifically for this study. Two approaches were developed: (1) ResNet-based image models and (2) regression models using anthropometric measurements. A multimodal fusion framework is also outlined for future expansion once paired datasets become available. The image-based model achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.44% and a Coefficient of Determination (R^2) of 0.807. These findings demonstrate that AI-assisted models can offer accessible and low-cost body fat estimates, supporting future consumer applications in health and fitness.</description>

      <title>Efficient Mathematical Reasoning Models via Dynamic Pruning and Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of deep learning, large language models have shown strong capabilities in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical equation solving. However, their substantial computational and storage costs hinder practical deployment. This paper proposes a lightweight optimization method that integrates dynamic attention head pruning with knowledge distillation. The approach dynamically evaluates the importance of each attention head in the multi-head attention mechanism using a combination of weight norms and entropy, and prunes redundant heads in real time to reduce computational overhead. To mitigate performance degradation, knowledge distillation transfers information from the original model to the pruned student, enabling the smaller model to preserve reasoning ability. Experiments conducted on both Math23k and ASDiv-A verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. For example, on Math23k with a 30% pruning ratio, parameters are reduced by 18.7%, inference speed is improved by 27.5%, FLOPs are reduced by 19.3%, and accuracy drops only 0.7% (from 84.4% to 83.7%). These results demonstrate that the method achieves substantial efficiency gains while maintaining strong reasoning performance, providing a practical solution for efficient deployment of large language models in mathematical reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Value Alignment for LLMs via Value Decorrelation and Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), aligning them with human values for safety and ethics has become a critical challenge. This problem is especially challenging when multiple, potentially conflicting human values must be considered and balanced. Although several variants of existing alignment methods (such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)) have been proposed to address multi-value alignment, they suffer from notable limitations: 1) they are often unstable and inefficient in multi-value optimization; and 2) they fail to effectively handle value conflicts. As a result, these approaches typically struggle to achieve optimal trade-offs when aligning multiple values.
  To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called Multi-Value Alignment (MVA). It mitigates alignment degradation caused by parameter interference among diverse human values by minimizing their mutual information. Furthermore, we propose a value extrapolation strategy to efficiently explore the Pareto frontier, thereby constructing a set of LLMs with diverse value preferences.

      <description>arXiv:2511.17580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a multi-resource load balancing strategy which can be utilised within an agent-based system. This approach can assist system designers in their attempts to optimise the structure for complex enterprise architectures. In this system, the social behaviour of the agent and its adaptation abilities are applied to determine an optimal setup for a given configuration. All the methods have been developed to allow the agent's self-assessment. The proposed agent system has been implemented and the experiment results are presented here.</description>

      <title>GateRA: Token-Aware Modulation for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, DoRA, and HiRA, enable lightweight adaptation of large pre-trained models via low-rank updates. However, existing PEFT approaches apply static, input-agnostic updates to all tokens, disregarding the varying importance and difficulty of different inputs. This uniform treatment can lead to overfitting on trivial content or under-adaptation on more informative regions, especially in autoregressive settings with distinct prefill and decoding dynamics. In this paper, we propose GateRA, a unified framework that introduces token-aware modulation to dynamically adjust the strength of PEFT updates. By incorporating adaptive gating into standard PEFT branches, GateRA enables selective, token-level adaptation, preserving pre-trained knowledge for well-modeled inputs while focusing capacity on challenging cases. Empirical visualizations reveal phase-sensitive behaviors, where GateRA automatically suppresses updates for redundant prefill tokens while emphasizing adaptation during decoding. To promote confident and efficient modulation, we further introduce an entropy-based regularization that encourages near-binary gating decisions. This regularization prevents diffuse update patterns and leads to interpretable, sparse adaptation without hard thresholding. Finally, we present a theoretical analysis showing that GateRA induces a soft gradient-masking effect over the PEFT path, enabling continuous and differentiable control over adaptation. Experiments on multiple commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that GateRA consistently outperforms or matches prior PEFT methods.</description>

      <title>LLM-Powered Text-Attributed Graph Anomaly Detection via Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection on attributed graphs plays an essential role in applications such as fraud detection, intrusion monitoring, and misinformation analysis. However, text-attributed graphs (TAGs), in which node information is expressed in natural language, remain underexplored, largely due to the absence of standardized benchmark datasets. In this work, we introduce TAG-AD, a comprehensive benchmark for anomaly node detection on TAGs. TAG-AD leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate realistic anomalous node texts directly in the raw text space, producing anomalies that are semantically coherent yet contextually inconsistent and thus more reflective of real-world irregularities. In addition, TAG-AD incorporates multiple other anomaly types, enabling thorough and reproducible evaluation of graph anomaly detection (GAD) methods. With these datasets, we further benchmark existing unsupervised GNN-based GAD methods as well as zero-shot LLMs for GAD.
  As part of our zero-shot detection setup, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-assisted, LLM-based zero-shot anomaly detection framework. The framework mitigates reliance on brittle, hand-crafted prompts by constructing a global anomaly knowledge base and distilling it into reusable analysis frameworks. Our experimental results reveal a clear division of strengths: LLMs are particularly effective at detecting contextual anomalies, whereas GNN-based methods remain superior for structural anomaly detection. Moreover, RAG-assisted prompting achieves performance comparable to human-designed prompts while eliminating manual prompt engineering, underscoring the practical value of our RAG-assisted zero-shot LLM anomaly detection framework.</description>

      <title>PaSE: Prototype-aligned Calibration and Shapley-based Equilibrium for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) seeks to understand human emotions by integrating textual, acoustic, and visual signals. Although multimodal fusion is designed to leverage cross-modal complementarity, real-world scenarios often exhibit modality competition: dominant modalities tend to overshadow weaker ones, leading to suboptimal performance.In this paper, we propose PaSE, a novel Prototype-aligned Calibration and Shapley-optimized Equilibrium framework, which enhances collaboration while explicitly mitigating modality competition. PaSE first applies Prototype-guided Calibration Learning (PCL) to refine unimodal representations and align them through an Entropic Optimal Transport mechanism that ensures semantic consistency. To further stabilize optimization, we introduce a Dual-Phase Optimization strategy. A prototype-gated fusion module is first used to extract shared representations, followed by Shapley-based Gradient Modulation (SGM), which adaptively adjusts gradients according to the contribution of each modality. Extensive experiments on IEMOCAP, MOSI, and MOSEI confirm that PaSE achieves the superior performance and effectively alleviates modality competition.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Adaptive Consensus Network: A Dynamic Framework for Scalable Consensus in Collaborative Multi-Agent AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The consensus strategies used in collaborative multi-agent systems (MAS) face notable challenges related to adaptability, scalability, and convergence certainties. These approaches, including structured workflows, debate models, and iterative voting, often lead to communication bottlenecks, stringent decision-making processes, and delayed responses in solving complex and evolving tasks. This article introduces a three-tier architecture, the Hierarchical Adaptive Consensus Network (\hacn), which suggests various consensus policies based on task characterization and agent performance metrics. The first layer collects the confidence-based voting outcomes of several local agent clusters. In contrast, the second level facilitates inter-cluster communication through cross-clustered partial knowledge sharing and dynamic timeouts. The third layer provides system-wide coordination and final arbitration by employing a global orchestration framework with adaptable decision rules. The proposed model achieves $\bigO(n)$ communication complexity, as opposed to the $\bigO(n^2)$ complexity of the existing fully connected MAS. Experiments performed in a simulated environment yielded a 99.9\% reduction in communication overhead during consensus convergence. Furthermore, the proposed approach ensures consensus convergence through hierarchical escalation and dynamic adaptation for a wide variety of complicated tasks.</description>

      <title>Emotion and Intention Guided Multi-Modal Learning for Sticker Response Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stickers are widely used in online communication to convey emotions and implicit intentions. The Sticker Response Selection (SRS) task aims to select the most contextually appropriate sticker based on the dialogue. However, existing methods typically rely on semantic matching and model emotional and intentional cues separately, which can lead to mismatches when emotions and intentions are misaligned. To address this issue, we propose Emotion and Intention Guided Multi-Modal Learning (EIGML). This framework is the first to jointly model emotion and intention, effectively reducing the bias caused by isolated modeling and significantly improving selection accuracy. Specifically, we introduce Dual-Level Contrastive Framework to perform both intra-modality and inter-modality alignment, ensuring consistent representation of emotional and intentional features within and across modalities. In addition, we design an Intention-Emotion Guided Multi-Modal Fusion module that integrates emotional and intentional information progressively through three components: Emotion-Guided Intention Knowledge Selection, Intention-Emotion Guided Attention Fusion, and Similarity-Adjusted Matching Mechanism. This design injects rich, effective information into the model and enables a deeper understanding of the dialogue, ultimately enhancing sticker selection performance. Experimental results on two public SRS datasets show that EIGML consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher accuracy and a better understanding of emotional and intentional features. Code is provided in the supplementary materials.</description>

      <title>SHAP Distance: An Explainability-Aware Metric for Evaluating the Semantic Fidelity of Synthetic Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic tabular data, which are widely used in domains such as healthcare, enterprise operations, and customer analytics, are increasingly evaluated to ensure that they preserve both privacy and utility. While existing evaluation practices typically focus on distributional similarity (e.g., the Kullback-Leibler divergence) or predictive performance (e.g., Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real (TSTR) accuracy), these approaches fail to assess semantic fidelity, that is, whether models trained on synthetic data follow reasoning patterns consistent with those trained on real data. To address this gap, we introduce the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) Distance, a novel explainability-aware metric that is defined as the cosine distance between the global SHAP attribution vectors derived from classifiers trained on real versus synthetic datasets. By analyzing datasets that span clinical health records with physiological features, enterprise invoice transactions with heterogeneous scales, and telecom churn logs with mixed categorical-numerical attributes, we demonstrate that the SHAP Distance reliably identifies semantic discrepancies that are overlooked by standard statistical and predictive measures. In particular, our results show that the SHAP Distance captures feature importance shifts and underrepresented tail effects that the Kullback-Leibler divergence and Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real accuracy fail to detect. This study positions the SHAP Distance as a practical and discriminative tool for auditing the semantic fidelity of synthetic tabular data, and offers practical guidelines for integrating attribution-based evaluation into future benchmarking pipelines.</description>

      <title>GigaEvo: An Open Source Optimization Framework Powered By LLMs And Evolution Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in LLM-guided evolutionary computation, particularly AlphaEvolve (Novikov et al., 2025; Georgiev et al., 2025), have demonstrated remarkable success in discovering novel mathematical constructions and solving challenging optimization problems. However, the high-level descriptions in published work leave many implementation details unspecified, hindering reproducibility and further research. In this report we present GigaEvo, an extensible open-source framework that enables researchers to study and experiment with hybrid LLM-evolution approaches inspired by AlphaEvolve. Our system provides modular implementations of key components: MAP-Elites quality-diversity algorithms, asynchronous DAG-based evaluation pipelines, LLM-driven mutation operators with insight generation and bidirectional lineage tracking, and flexible multi-island evolutionary strategies. In order to assess reproducibility and validate our implementation we evaluate GigaEvo on challenging problems from the AlphaEvolve paper: Heilbronn triangle placement, circle packing in squares, and high-dimensional kissing numbers. The framework emphasizes modularity, concurrency, and ease of experimentation, enabling rapid prototyping through declarative configuration. We provide detailed descriptions of system architecture, implementation decisions, and experimental methodology to support further research in LLM driven evolutionary methods. The GigaEvo framework and all experimental code are available at https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/gigaevo-core.</description>

      <title>Boosting Reinforcement Learning in 3D Visuospatial Tasks Through Human-Informed Curriculum Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning is a mature technology, often suggested as a potential route towards Artificial General Intelligence, with the ambitious goal of replicating the wide range of abilities found in natural and artificial intelligence, including the complexities of human cognition. While RL had shown successes in relatively constrained environments, such as the classic Atari games and specific continuous control problems, recent years have seen efforts to expand its applicability. This work investigates the potential of RL in demonstrating intelligent behaviour and its progress in addressing more complex and less structured problem domains.
  We present an investigation into the capacity of modern RL frameworks in addressing a seemingly straightforward 3D Same-Different visuospatial task. While initial applications of state-of-the-art methods, including PPO, behavioural cloning and imitation learning, revealed challenges in directly learning optimal strategies, the successful implementation of curriculum learning offers a promising avenue. Effective learning was achieved by strategically designing the lesson plan based on the findings of a real-world human experiment.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction-Driven Multimodal Representation Learning for Automated Media Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broadcast and media organizations increasingly rely on artificial intelligence to automate the labor-intensive processes of content indexing, tagging, and metadata generation. However, existing AI systems typically operate on a single modality-such as video, audio, or text-limiting their understanding of complex, cross-modal relationships in broadcast material. In this work, we propose a Multimodal Autoencoder (MMAE) that learns unified representations across text, audio, and visual data, enabling end-to-end automation of metadata extraction and semantic clustering. The model is trained on the recently introduced LUMA dataset, a fully aligned benchmark of multimodal triplets representative of real-world media content. By minimizing joint reconstruction losses across modalities, the MMAE discovers modality-invariant semantic structures without relying on large paired or contrastive datasets. We demonstrate significant improvements in clustering and alignment metrics (Silhouette, ARI, NMI) compared to linear baselines, indicating that reconstruction-based multimodal embeddings can serve as a foundation for scalable metadata generation and cross-modal retrieval in broadcast archives. These results highlight the potential of reconstruction-driven multimodal learning to enhance automation, searchability, and content management efficiency in modern broadcast workflows.</description>

      <title>From Projection to Prediction: Beyond Logits for Scalable Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) typically involves a two-stage pipeline at the output layer: hidden states are projected into vocabulary logits via a linear transformation (lm_head), followed by cross-entropy loss computation against target tokens. While conceptually simple, this design incurs substantial overhead. The intermediate logits tensor, with dimensions proportional to batch size, sequence length, and vocabulary size, must be fully materialized in GPU memory, even though only one target token per position is ultimately used. This leads to significant memory footprint and bandwidth comsumption, limiting scalability and slowing training throughput.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach to integrates the output projection and loss prediction into a single operation. By directly computing the loss from hidden states and target tokens, our approach bypasses explicit logits materialization. This design reduces memory usage and alleviates bandwidth pressure. Experiments on LLM training demonstrate that our method achieves substantial memory savings and measurable speedups compared to the standard two-stage pipeline, enabling large batch sizes and longer sequences without sacrificing accuracy. Our work highlights the benefits of rethinking the boundary between projection and prediction, offering a practical systems optimization for efficient LLM training.</description>

      <title>Beyond Surface-Level Similarity: Hierarchical Contamination Detection for Synthetic Training Data in Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data has become essential for training foundation models, yet benchmark contamination threatens evaluation integrity. Although existing detection methods identify token-level overlap, they fail to detect semantic-level contamination where synthetic data conceptually resemble benchmarks without lexical overlap. This gap is critical as foundation models increasingly train on synthetic data that may implicitly encode benchmark knowledge. We propose a hierarchical contamination detection framework operating at four levels: token level, semantic level, reasoning pattern, and performance cliff detection. Through controlled experiments on MMLU, GSM8K and HumanEval, we demonstrate that semantic-level contamination evades existing methods (F1=0.17-0.49) but is effectively detected by our hierarchical approach (F1 = 0.76), with an average improvement of 26. 5\% over state-of-the-art baselines. Our framework provides practitioners with practical tools for audit pipelines and enables responsible deployment of synthetic training data.</description>

      <title>BrainHGT: A Hierarchical Graph Transformer for Interpretable Brain Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Transformer shows remarkable potential in brain network analysis due to its ability to model graph structures and complex node relationships. Most existing methods typically model the brain as a flat network, ignoring its modular structure, and their attention mechanisms treat all brain region connections equally, ignoring distance-related node connection patterns. However, brain information processing is a hierarchical process that involves local and long-range interactions between brain regions, interactions between regions and sub-functional modules, and interactions among functional modules themselves. This hierarchical interaction mechanism enables the brain to efficiently integrate local computations and global information flow, supporting the execution of complex cognitive functions. To address this issue, we propose BrainHGT, a hierarchical Graph Transformer that simulates the brain's natural information processing from local regions to global communities. Specifically, we design a novel long-short range attention encoder that utilizes parallel pathways to handle dense local interactions and sparse long-range connections, thereby effectively alleviating the over-globalizing issue. To further capture the brain's modular architecture, we designe a prior-guided clustering module that utilizes a cross-attention mechanism to group brain regions into functional communities and leverage neuroanatomical prior to guide the clustering process, thereby improving the biological plausibility and interpretability. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method significantly improves performance of disease identification, and can reliably capture the sub-functional modules of the brain, demonstrating its interpretability.</description>

Abstract: Understanding brain function represents a fundamental goal in neuroscience, with critical implications for therapeutic interventions and neural engineering applications. Computational modeling provides a quantitative framework for accelerating this understanding, but faces a fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency and high-fidelity modeling. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel Energy-based Autoregressive Generation (EAG) framework that employs an energy-based transformer learning temporal dynamics in latent space through strictly proper scoring rules, enabling efficient generation with realistic population and single-neuron spiking statistics. Evaluation on synthetic Lorenz datasets and two Neural Latents Benchmark datasets (MC_Maze and Area2_bump) demonstrates that EAG achieves state-of-the-art generation quality with substantial computational efficiency improvements, particularly over diffusion-based methods. Beyond optimal performance, conditional generation applications show two capabilities: generalizing to unseen behavioral contexts and improving motor brain-computer interface decoding accuracy using synthetic neural data. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of energy-based modeling for neural population dynamics with applications in neuroscience research and neural engineering.

      <title>Unified Low-Light Traffic Image Enhancement via Multi-Stage Illumination Recovery and Adaptive Noise Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing low-light traffic images is crucial for reliable perception in autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and urban surveillance systems. Nighttime and dimly lit traffic scenes often suffer from poor visibility due to low illumination, noise, motion blur, non-uniform lighting, and glare from vehicle headlights or street lamps, which hinder tasks such as object detection and scene understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a fully unsupervised multi-stage deep learning framework for low-light traffic image enhancement. The model decomposes images into illumination and reflectance components, progressively refined by three specialized modules: (1) Illumination Adaptation, for global and local brightness correction; (2) Reflectance Restoration, for noise suppression and structural detail recovery using spatial-channel attention; and (3) Over-Exposure Compensation, for reconstructing saturated regions and balancing scene luminance. The network is trained using self-supervised reconstruction, reflectance smoothness, perceptual consistency, and domain-aware regularization losses, eliminating the need for paired ground-truth images. Experiments on general and traffic-specific datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, NIQE) and qualitative visual quality. Our approach enhances visibility, preserves structure, and improves downstream perception reliability in real-world low-light traffic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-Play Multi-Concept Adaptive Blending for High-Fidelity Text-to-Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating multiple personalized concepts into a single image has recently become a significant area of focus within Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. However, existing methods often underperform on complex multi-object scenes due to unintended alterations in both personalized and non-personalized regions. This not only fails to preserve the intended prompt structure but also disrupts interactions among regions, leading to semantic inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce plug-and-play multi-concept adaptive blending for high-fidelity text-to-image synthesis (PnP-MIX), an innovative, tuning-free approach designed to seamlessly embed multiple personalized concepts into a single generated image. Our method leverages guided appearance attention to faithfully reflect the intended appearance of each personalized concept. To further enhance compositional fidelity, we present a mask-guided noise mixing strategy that preserves the integrity of non-personalized regions such as the background or unrelated objects while enabling the precise integration of personalized objects. Finally, to mitigate concept leakage, i.e., the inadvertent leakage of personalized concept features into other regions, we propose background dilution++, a novel strategy that effectively reduces such leakage and promotes accurate localization of features within personalized regions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PnP-MIX consistently surpasses existing methodologies in both single- and multi-concept personalization scenarios, underscoring its robustness and superior performance without additional model tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Tensor Gauge Flow Models, a new class of Generative Flow Models that generalize Gauge Flow Models and Higher Gauge Flow Models by incorporating higher-order Tensor Gauge Fields into the Flow Equation. This extension allows the model to encode richer geometric and gauge-theoretic structure in the data, leading to more expressive flow dynamics. Experiments on Gaussian mixture models show that Tensor Gauge Flow Models achieve improved generative performance compared to both standard and gauge flow baselines.</description>

      <title>From Competition to Coordination: Market Making as a Scalable Framework for Safe and Aligned Multi-Agent LLM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As foundation models are increasingly deployed as interacting agents in multi-agent systems, their collective behavior raises new challenges for trustworthiness, transparency, and accountability. Traditional coordination mechanisms, such as centralized oversight or adversarial adjudication, struggle to scale and often obscure how decisions emerge. We introduce a market-making framework for multi-agent large language model (LLM) coordination that organizes agent interactions as structured economic exchanges. In this setup, each agent acts as a market participant, updating and trading probabilistic beliefs, to converge toward shared, truthful outcomes. By aligning local incentives with collective epistemic goals, the framework promotes self-organizing, verifiable reasoning without requiring external enforcement. Empirically, we evaluate this approach across factual reasoning, ethical judgment, and commonsense inference tasks. Market-based coordination yields accuracy gains of up to 10% over single-shot baselines while preserving interpretability and transparency of intermediate reasoning steps. Beyond these improvements, our findings demonstrate that economic coordination principles can operationalize accountability and robustness in multi-agent LLM systems, offering a scalable pathway toward self-correcting, socially responsible AI capable of maintaining trust and oversight in real world deployment scenarios.</description>

      <title>Neurocircuitry-Inspired Hierarchical Graph Causal Attention Networks for Explainable Depression Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), affecting millions worldwide, exhibits complex pathophysiology manifested through disrupted brain network dynamics. Although graph neural networks that leverage neuroimaging data have shown promise in depression diagnosis, existing approaches are predominantly data-driven and operate largely as black-box models, lacking neurobiological interpretability. Here, we present NH-GCAT (Neurocircuitry-Inspired Hierarchical Graph Causal Attention Networks), a novel framework that bridges neuroscience domain knowledge with deep learning by explicitly and hierarchically modeling depression-specific mechanisms at different spatial scales. Our approach introduces three key technical contributions: (1) at the local brain regional level, we design a residual gated fusion module that integrates temporal blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) dynamics with functional connectivity patterns, specifically engineered to capture local depression-relevant low-frequency neural oscillations; (2) at the multi-regional circuit level, we propose a hierarchical circuit encoding scheme that aggregates regional node representations following established depression neurocircuitry organization, and (3) at the multi-circuit network level, we develop a variational latent causal attention mechanism that leverages a continuous probabilistic latent space to infer directed information flow among critical circuits, characterizing disease-altered whole-brain inter-circuit interactions. Rigorous leave-one-site-out cross-validation on the REST-meta-MDD dataset demonstrates NH-GCAT's state-of-the-art performance in depression classification, achieving a sample-size weighted-average accuracy of 73.3\% and an AUROC of 76.4\%, while simultaneously providing neurobiologically meaningful explanations.</description>

      <title>M$^2$OE$^2$-GL: A Family of Probabilistic Load Forecasters That Scales to Massive Customers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic load forecasting is widely studied and underpins power system planning, operation, and risk-aware decision making. Deep learning forecasters have shown strong ability to capture complex temporal and contextual patterns, achieving substantial accuracy gains. However, at the scale of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of loads in large distribution feeders, a deployment dilemma emerges: training and maintaining one model per customer is computationally and storage intensive, while using a single global model ignores distributional shifts across customer types, locations, and phases. Prior work typically focuses on single-load forecasters, global models across multiple loads, or adaptive/personalized models for relatively small settings, and rarely addresses the combined challenges of heterogeneity and scalability in large feeders. We propose M2OE2-GL, a global-to-local extension of the M2OE2 probabilistic forecaster. We first pretrain a single global M2OE2 base model across all feeder loads, then apply lightweight fine-tuning to derive a compact family of group-specific forecasters. Evaluated on realistic utility data, M2OE2-GL yields substantial error reductions while remaining scalable to very large numbers of loads.</description>

      <title>Can we use LLMs to bootstrap reinforcement learning? -- A case study in digital health behavior change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalizing digital applications for health behavior change is a promising route to making them more engaging and effective. This especially holds for approaches that adapt to users and their specific states (e.g., motivation, knowledge, wants) over time. However, developing such approaches requires making many design choices, whose effectiveness is difficult to predict from literature and costly to evaluate in practice. In this work, we explore whether large language models (LLMs) can be used out-of-the-box to generate samples of user interactions that provide useful information for training reinforcement learning models for digital behavior change settings. Using real user data from four large behavior change studies as comparison, we show that LLM-generated samples can be useful in the absence of real data. Comparisons to the samples provided by human raters further show that LLM-generated samples reach the performance of human raters. Additional analyses of different prompting strategies including shorter and longer prompt variants, chain-of-thought prompting, and few-shot prompting show that the relative effectiveness of different strategies depends on both the study and the LLM with also relatively large differences between prompt paraphrases alone. We provide recommendations for how LLM-generated samples can be useful in practice.</description>

      <title>Model-to-Model Knowledge Transmission (M2KT): A Data-Free Framework for Cross-Model Understanding Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence systems depend heavily on large datasets for both training and transferring knowledge between models. Knowledge distillation, transfer learning, and dataset distillation have made such transfers more efficient, yet they remain fundamentally data-driven: a teacher must produce examples, logits, or gradients for a student to learn. In this work, we introduce Model-to-Model Knowledge Transmission (M2KT), a novel paradigm for data-free conceptual transfer between neural networks. M2KT enables models to exchange knowledge packets that encapsulate structured concept embeddings, abstraction graphs, reasoning traces, and provenance metadata. Unlike classical distillation, M2KT operates primarily in concept space rather than example space, and it does not require labeled datasets or teacher-generated outputs during transfer. We formalize the notion of concept manifolds, introduce an inter-model alignment mapping between teacher and student latent spaces, and derive a composite loss that enforces geometric, structural, and reasoning consistency together with explicit safety constraints. We further present algorithmic procedures for teacher-side packet generation and student-side ingestion and verification. Experiments on symbolic reasoning with large language models show that M2KT can achieve approximately 85 to 90 percent of teacher performance while reducing data usage by over 98 percent compared to standard knowledge distillation. This work establishes a theoretical and practical foundation for data-free AI-to-AI knowledge transfer and self-improving model ecosystems.</description>

      <title>MamTiff-CAD: Multi-Scale Latent Diffusion with Mamba+ for Complex Parametric Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is crucial in industrial applications, yet existing approaches often struggle to generate long sequence parametric commands due to complex CAD models' geometric and topological constraints. To address this challenge, we propose MamTiff-CAD, a novel CAD parametric command sequences generation framework that leverages a Transformer-based diffusion model for multi-scale latent representations. Specifically, we design a novel autoencoder that integrates Mamba+ and Transformer, to transfer parameterized CAD sequences into latent representations. The Mamba+ block incorporates a forget gate mechanism to effectively capture long-range dependencies. The non-autoregressive Transformer decoder reconstructs the latent representations. A diffusion model based on multi-scale Transformer is then trained on these latent embeddings to learn the distribution of long sequence commands. In addition, we also construct a dataset that consists of long parametric sequences, which is up to 256 commands for a single CAD model. Experiments demonstrate that MamTiff-CAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on both reconstruction and generation tasks, confirming its effectiveness for long sequence (60-256) CAD model generation.</description>

      <title>SWITCH: Benchmarking Modeling and Handling of Tangible Interfaces in Long-horizon Embodied Scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous intelligence requires not only perception and reasoning, but critically, effective interaction with the existing world and its infrastructure. Everyday environments are rich in tangible control interfaces (TCIs), e.g., light switches, appliance panels, and embedded GUIs, that demand commonsense and physics reasoning, but also causal prediction and outcome verification in time and space (e.g., delayed heating, remote lights). Moreover, failures here have potential safety implications, yet current benchmarks rarely test grounding, partial observability (video), or post-hoc verification in situated settings. We introduce SWITCH (Semantic World Interface Tasks for Control and Handling), an embodied, task-driven benchmark created through iterative releases to probe these gaps. Its first iteration, SWITCH-Basic, evaluates five complementary abilities:task-aware VQA, semantic UI grounding, action generation, state-transition prediction, and result verification, under egocentric RGB video input and device diversity. Across 351 tasks spanning 98 real devices and appliances, commercial and open LMMMs exhibit inconsistent performance even on single-step interactions, often over-relying on textual cues and under-using visual or video evidence (and high aggregate scores can mask such failures). SWITCH provides data, code, and held-out splits to enable reproducible evaluation and community contributions toward more challenging future iterations of the benchmark and the creation of training datasets. Benchmark resources are available at: https://github.com/BAAI-Agents/SWITCH.</description>

Abstract: Conflict resolution and consensus building represent critical challenges in multi-agent systems, negotiations, and collaborative decision-making processes. This paper introduces Dialogue Diplomats, a novel end-to-end multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed for automated conflict resolution and consensus building in complex, dynamic environments. The proposed system integrates advanced deep reinforcement learning architectures with dialogue-based negotiation protocols, enabling autonomous agents to engage in sophisticated conflict resolution through iterative communication and strategic adaptation. We present three primary contributions: first, a novel Hierarchical Consensus Network (HCN) architecture that combines attention mechanisms with graph neural networks to model inter-agent dependencies and conflict dynamics. second, a Progressive Negotiation Protocol (PNP) that structures multi-round dialogue interactions with adaptive concession strategies; and third, a Context-Aware Reward Shaping mechanism that balances individual agent objectives with collective consensus goals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our study provides a full deep learning system for automated classification of brain tumors from MRI images, includes six benchmarked architectures (five ImageNet-pre-trained models (VGG-16, Inception V3, ResNet-50, Inception-ResNet V2, Xception) and a custom built, compact CNN (1.31M params)). The study moves the needle forward in a number of ways, including (1) full standardization of assessment with respect to preprocessing, training sets/protocols (optimizing networks with the AdamW optimizer, CosineAnnealingLR, patiene for early stopping = 7), and metrics to assess performance were identical along all models; (2) a high level of confidence in the localizations based on prior studies as both Grad-CAM and GradientShap explanation were used to establish anatomically important and meaningful attention regions and address the black-box issue; (3) a compact 1.31 million parameter CNN was developed that achieved 96.49% testing accuracy and was 100 times smaller than Inception-ResNet V2 while permitting real-time inference (375ms) on edge devices; (4) full evaluation beyond accuracy reporting based on measures of intersection over union, Hausdorff distance, and precision-recall curves, and confusion matrices across all splits. Inception-ResNet V2 reached state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 99.53% accuracy on testing and obtaining a precision, recall, and F1-score of at least 99.50% dominant performance based on metrics of recent studies. We demonstrated a lightweight model that is suitable to deploy on devices that do not have multi-GPU infrastructure in under-resourced settings. This end-to-end solution considers accuracy, interpretability, and deployability of trustworthy AI to create the framework necessary for performance assessment and deployment within advance and low-resource healthcare systems to an extent that enabled participation at the clinical screening and triage level.</description>

Abstract: As digital communication grows in importance when connecting with healthcare providers, traditional behavioral and content message features are imbued with renewed significance. If one is to meaningfully connect with them, it is crucial to understand what drives them to engage and respond. In this study, the authors analyzed several million text messages sent through the Impiricus platform to learn which factors influenced whether or not a doctor clicked on a link in a message. Several key insights came to light through the use of logistic regression, random forest, and neural network models, the details of which the authors discuss in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimizing loss functions is central to machine-learning training. Although first-order methods dominate practical applications, higher-order techniques such as Newton's method can deliver greater accuracy and faster convergence, yet are often avoided due to their computational cost. This work analyzes the impact of finite-precision arithmetic on Newton steps and establishes a convergence theorem for mixed-precision Newton optimizers, including "quasi" and "inexact" variants. The theorem provides not only convergence guarantees but also a priori estimates of the achievable solution accuracy. Empirical evaluations on standard regression benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform Adam on the Australian and MUSH datasets. The second part of the manuscript introduces GN_k, a generalized Gauss-Newton method that enables partial computation of second-order derivatives. GN_k attains performance comparable to full Newton's method on regression tasks while requiring significantly fewer derivative evaluations.</description>

      <title>AI-based framework to predict animal and pen feed intake in feedlot beef cattle</title>

Abstract: Advances in technology are transforming sustainable cattle farming practices, with electronic feeding systems generating big longitudinal datasets on individual animal feed intake, offering the possibility for autonomous precision livestock systems. However, the literature still lacks a methodology that fully leverages these longitudinal big data to accurately predict feed intake accounting for environmental conditions. To fill this gap, we developed an AI-based framework to accurately predict feed intake of individual animals and pen-level aggregation. Data from 19 experiments (&gt;16.5M samples; 2013-2024) conducted at Nancy M. Cummings Research Extension &amp; Education Center (Carmen, ID) feedlot facility and environmental data from AgriMet Network weather stations were used to develop two novel environmental indices: InComfort-Index, based solely on meteorological variables, showed good predictive capability for thermal comfort but had limited ability to predict feed intake; EASI-Index, a hybrid index integrating environmental variables with feed intake behavior, performed well in predicting feed intake but was less effective for thermal comfort. Together with the environmental indices, machine learning models were trained and the best-performing machine learning model (XGBoost) accuracy was RMSE of 1.38 kg/day for animal-level and only 0.14 kg/(day-animal) at pen-level. This approach provides a robust AI-based framework for predicting feed intake in individual animals and pens, with potential applications in precision management of feedlot cattle, through feed waste reduction, resource optimization, and climate-adaptive livestock management.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Adversarial Vulnerabilities in Modern Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent boom and rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into a wide range of applications warrants a deeper understanding of their security and safety vulnerabilities. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the susceptibility to jailbreak attacks for two leading publicly available LLMs, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash and OpenAI's GPT-4 (specifically the GPT-4o mini model accessible in the free tier). The research utilized two main bypass strategies: 'self-bypass', where models were prompted to circumvent their own safety protocols, and 'cross-bypass', where one model generated adversarial prompts to exploit vulnerabilities in the other. Four attack methods were employed - direct injection, role-playing, context manipulation, and obfuscation - to generate five distinct categories of unsafe content: hate speech, illegal activities, malicious code, dangerous content, and misinformation. The success of the attack was determined by the generation of disallowed content, with successful jailbreaks assigned a severity score. The findings indicate a disparity in jailbreak susceptibility between 2.5 Flash and GPT-4, suggesting variations in their safety implementations or architectural design. Cross-bypass attacks were particularly effective, indicating that an ample amount of vulnerabilities exist in the underlying transformer architecture. This research contributes a scalable framework for automated AI red-teaming and provides data-driven insights into the current state of LLM safety, underscoring the complex challenge of balancing model capabilities with robust safety mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Empa: An AI-Powered Virtual Mentor for Developing Global Collaboration Skills in HPC Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-performance computing (HPC) and parallel computing increasingly rely on global collaboration among diverse teams, yet traditional computing curricula inadequately prepare students for cross-cultural teamwork essential in modern computational research environments. This paper presents Empa, an AI-powered virtual mentor that integrates intercultural collaboration training into undergraduate computing education. Built using large language models and deployed through a progressive web application, Empa guides students through structured activities covering cultural dimensions, communication styles, and conflict resolution that are critical for effective multicultural teamwork. Our system addresses the growing need for culturally competent HPC professionals by helping computing students develop skills to collaborate effectively in international research teams, contribute to global computational projects, and navigate the cultural complexities inherent in distributed computing environments. Pilot preparation for deployment in computing courses demonstrates the feasibility of AI-mediated intercultural training and provides insights into scalable approaches for developing intercultural collaboration skills essential for HPC workforce development.</description>

      <title>MURMUR: Using cross-user chatter to break collaborative language agents in groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language agents are rapidly expanding from single-user assistants to multi-user collaborators in shared workspaces and groups. However, today's language models lack a mechanism for isolating user interactions and concurrent tasks, creating a new attack vector inherent to this new setting: cross-user poisoning (CUP). In a CUP attack, an adversary injects ordinary-looking messages that poison the persistent, shared state, which later triggers the agent to execute unintended, attacker-specified actions on behalf of benign users. We validate CUP on real systems, successfully attacking popular multi-user agents. To study the phenomenon systematically, we present MURMUR, a framework that composes single-user tasks into concurrent, group-based scenarios using an LLM to generate realistic, history-aware user interactions. We observe that CUP attacks succeed at high rates and their effects persist across multiple tasks, thus posing fundamental risks to multi-user LLM deployments. Finally, we introduce a first-step defense with task-based clustering to mitigate this new class of vulnerability</description>

      <title>LLM and Agent-Driven Data Analysis: A Systematic Approach for Enterprise Applications and System-level Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress in Generative AI and Agent technologies is profoundly transforming enterprise data management and analytics. Traditional database applications and system deployment are fundamentally impacted by AI-driven tools, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and vector database technologies, which provide new pathways for semantic querying over enterprise knowledge bases. In the meantime, data security and compliance are top priorities for organizations adopting AI technologies. For enterprise data analysis, SQL generations powered by large language models (LLMs) and AI agents, has emerged as a key bridge connecting natural language with structured data, effectively lowering the barrier to enterprise data access and improving analytical efficiency. This paper focuses on enterprise data analysis applications and system deployment, covering a range of innovative frameworks, enabling complex query understanding, multi-agent collaboration, security verification, and computational efficiency. Through representative use cases, key challenges related to distributed deployment, data security, and inherent difficulties in SQL generation tasks are discussed.</description>

      <title>Chatbots to strengthen democracy: An interdisciplinary seminar to train identifying argumentation techniques of science denial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent times, discussions on social media platforms have increasingly come under scrutiny due to the proliferation of science denial and fake news. Traditional solutions, such as regulatory actions, have been implemented to mitigate the spread of misinformation; however, these measures alone are not sufficient. To complement these efforts, educational approaches are becoming essential in empowering users to critically engage with misinformation. Conversation training, through serious games or personalized methods, has emerged as a promising strategy to help users handle science denial and toxic conversation tactics. This paper suggests an interdisciplinary seminar to explore the suitability of Large Language Models (LLMs) acting as a persona of a science denier to support people in identifying misinformation and improving resilience against toxic interactions. In the seminar, groups of four to five students will develop an AI-based chatbot that enables realistic interactions with science-denial argumentation structures. The task involves planning the setting, integrating a Large Language Model to facilitate natural dialogues, implementing the chatbot using the RASA framework, and evaluating the outcomes in a user study. It is crucial that users understand what they need to do during the interaction, how to conclude it, and how the relevant information is conveyed. The seminar does not aim to develop chatbots for practicing debunking but serves to teach AI technologies and test the feasibility of this idea for future applications. The chatbot seminar is conducted as a hybrid, parallel master's module at the participating educational institutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the question of how generative artificial intelligence can be used to reduce the time required to set up electromagnetic simulation models. A chatbot based on a large language model is presented, enabling the automated generation of simulation models with various functional enhancements. A chatbot-driven workflow based on the large language model Google Gemini 2.0 Flash automatically generates and solves two-dimensional finite element eddy current models using Gmsh and GetDP. Python is used to coordinate and automate interactions between the workflow components. The study considers conductor geometries with circular cross-sections of variable position and number. Additionally, users can define custom post-processing routines and receive a concise summary of model information and simulation results. Each functional enhancement includes the corresponding architectural modifications and illustrative case studies.</description>

      <title>A Cross-Cultural Assessment of Human Ability to Detect LLM-Generated Fake News about South Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates how cultural proximity affects the ability to detect AI-generated fake news by comparing South African participants with those from other nationalities. As large language models increasingly enable the creation of sophisticated fake news, understanding human detection capabilities becomes crucial, particularly across different cultural contexts. We conducted a survey where 89 participants (56 South Africans, 33 from other nationalities) evaluated 10 true South African news articles and 10 AI-generated fake versions. Results reveal an asymmetric pattern: South Africans demonstrated superior performance in detecting true news about their country (40% deviation from ideal rating) compared to other participants (52%), but performed worse at identifying fake news (62% vs. 55%). This difference may reflect South Africans' higher overall trust in news sources. Our analysis further shows that South Africans relied more on content knowledge and contextual understanding when judging credibility, while participants from other countries emphasised formal linguistic features such as grammar and structure. Overall, the deviation from ideal rating was similar between groups (51% vs. 53%), suggesting that cultural familiarity appears to aid verification of authentic information but may also introduce bias when evaluating fabricated content. These insights contribute to understanding cross-cultural dimensions of misinformation detection and inform strategies for combating AI-generated fake news in increasingly globalised information ecosystems where content crosses cultural and geographical boundaries.</description>

Abstract: As the Middle East emerges as a strategic hub for artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, the feasibility of deploying sustainable datacenters in desert environments has become a topic of growing relevance. This paper presents an empirical study analyzing the energy consumption and carbon footprint of large language model (LLM) inference across four countries: the United Arab Emirates, Iceland, Germany, and the United States of America using DeepSeek Coder 1.3B and the HumanEval dataset on the task of code generation. We use the CodeCarbon library to track energy and carbon emissions andcompare geographical trade-offs for climate-aware AI deployment. Our findings highlight both the challenges and potential of datacenters in desert regions and provide a balanced outlook on their role in global AI expansion.</description>

      <title>Dual-Path Knowledge-Augmented Contrastive Alignment Network for Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) is a technology that measures gene expression profiles within tissue sections while retaining spatial context. It reveals localized gene expression patterns and tissue heterogeneity, both of which are essential for understanding disease etiology. However, its high cost has driven efforts to predict spatial gene expression from whole slide images. Despite recent advancements, current methods still face significant limitations, such as under-exploitation of high-level biological context, over-reliance on exemplar retrievals, and inadequate alignment of heterogeneous modalities. To address these challenges, we propose DKAN, a novel Dual-path Knowledge-Augmented contrastive alignment Network that predicts spatially resolved gene expression by integrating histopathological images and gene expression profiles through a biologically informed approach. Specifically, we introduce an effective gene semantic representation module that leverages the external gene database to provide additional biological insights, thereby enhancing gene expression prediction. Further, we adopt a unified, one-stage contrastive learning paradigm, seamlessly combining contrastive learning and supervised learning to eliminate reliance on exemplars, complemented with an adaptive weighting mechanism. Additionally, we propose a dual-path contrastive alignment module that employs gene semantic features as dynamic cross-modal coordinators to enable effective heterogeneous feature integration. Through extensive experiments across three public ST datasets, DKAN demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models, establishing a new benchmark for spatial gene expression prediction and offering a powerful tool for advancing biological and clinical research.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Adversarial Transferability through Block Stretch and Shrink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks introduce small, deliberately crafted perturbations that mislead neural networks, and their transferability from white-box to black-box target models remains a critical research focus. Input transformation-based attacks are a subfield of adversarial attacks that enhance input diversity through input transformations to improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, existing input transformation-based attacks tend to exhibit limited cross-model transferability. Previous studies have shown that high transferability is associated with diverse attention heatmaps and the preservation of global semantics in transformed inputs. Motivated by this observation, we propose Block Stretch and Shrink (BSS), a method that divides an image into blocks and applies stretch and shrink operations to these blocks, thereby diversifying attention heatmaps in transformed inputs while maintaining their global semantics. Empirical evaluations on a subset of ImageNet demonstrate that BSS outperforms existing input transformation-based attack methods in terms of transferability. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the number scale, defined as the number of transformed inputs, in input transformation-based attacks, and advocate evaluating these methods under a unified number scale to enable fair and comparable assessments.</description>

      <title>ARISE: Agentic Rubric-Guided Iterative Survey Engine for Automated Scholarly Paper Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of scholarly literature presents significant challenges in synthesizing comprehensive, high-quality academic surveys. Recent advancements in agentic systems offer considerable promise for automating tasks that traditionally require human expertise, including literature review, synthesis, and iterative refinement. However, existing automated survey-generation solutions often suffer from inadequate quality control, poor formatting, and limited adaptability to iterative feedback, which are core elements intrinsic to scholarly writing.
  To address these limitations, we introduce ARISE, an Agentic Rubric-guided Iterative Survey Engine designed for automated generation and continuous refinement of academic survey papers. ARISE employs a modular architecture composed of specialized large language model agents, each mirroring distinct scholarly roles such as topic expansion, citation curation, literature summarization, manuscript drafting, and peer-review-based evaluation. Central to ARISE is a rubric-guided iterative refinement loop in which multiple reviewer agents independently assess manuscript drafts using a structured, behaviorally anchored rubric, systematically enhancing the content through synthesized feedback.
  Evaluating ARISE against state-of-the-art automated systems and recent human-written surveys, our experimental results demonstrate superior performance, achieving an average rubric-aligned quality score of 92.48. ARISE consistently surpasses baseline methods across metrics of comprehensiveness, accuracy, formatting, and overall scholarly rigor. All code, evaluation rubrics, and generated outputs are provided openly at https://github.com/ziwang11112/ARISE</description>

      <title>Liberating Logic in the Age of AI: Going Beyond Programming with Computational Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mastering one or more programming languages has historically been the gateway to implementing ideas on a computer. Today, that gateway is widening with advances in large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered coding assistants. What matters is no longer just fluency in traditional programming languages but the ability to think computationally by translating problems into forms that can be solved with computing tools. The capabilities enabled by these AI-augmented tools are rapidly leading to the commoditization of computational thinking, such that anyone who can articulate a problem in natural language can potentially harness computing power via AI.
  This shift is poised to radically influence how we teach computer science and data science in the United States and around the world. Educators and industry leaders are grappling with how to adapt: What should students learn when the hottest new programming language is English? How do we prepare a generation of computational thinkers who need not code every algorithm manually, but must still think critically, design solutions, and verify AI-augmented results?
  This paper explores these questions, examining the impact of natural language programming on software development, the emerging distinction between programmers and prompt-crafting problem solvers, the reforms needed in computer science and data science curricula, and the importance of maintaining our fundamental computational science principles in an AI-augmented future. Along the way, we compare approaches and share best practices for embracing this new paradigm in computing education.</description>

      <title>Understanding Counting Mechanisms in Large Language and Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) represent and compute numerical information in counting tasks. We use controlled experiments with repeated textual and visual items and analyze model behavior through causal mediation and activation patching. To this end, we design a specialized tool, CountScope, for mechanistic interpretability of numerical content. Results show that individual tokens or visual features encode latent positional count information that can be extracted and transferred across contexts. Layerwise analyses reveal a progressive emergence of numerical representations, with lower layers encoding small counts and higher layers representing larger ones. We identify an internal counter mechanism that updates with each item, stored mainly in the final token or region and transferable between contexts. In LVLMs, numerical information also appears in visual embeddings, shifting between background and foreground regions depending on spatial composition. Models rely on structural cues such as separators in text, which act as shortcuts for tracking item counts and influence the accuracy of numerical predictions. Overall, counting emerges as a structured, layerwise process in LLMs and follows the same general pattern in LVLMs, shaped by the properties of the vision encoder.</description>

      <title>Ternary Gamma Semirings as a Novel Algebraic Framework for Learnable Symbolic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary semirings such as the tropical, log, and probability semirings form a core algebraic tool in classical and modern neural inference systems, supporting tasks like Viterbi decoding, dynamic programming, and probabilistic reasoning. However, these structures rely on a binary multiplication operator and therefore model only pairwise interactions. Many symbolic AI tasks are inherently triadic, including subject-predicate-object relations in knowledge graphs, logical rules involving two premises and one conclusion, and multi-entity dependencies in structured decision processes. Existing neural architectures usually approximate these interactions by flattening or factorizing them into binary components, which weakens inductive structure, distorts relational meaning, and reduces interpretability.
  This paper introduces the Neural Ternary Semiring (NTS), a learnable and differentiable algebraic framework grounded in the theory of ternary Gamma-semirings. The central idea is to replace the usual binary product with a native ternary operator implemented by neural networks and guided by algebraic regularizers enforcing approximate associativity and distributivity. This construction allows triadic relationships to be represented directly rather than reconstructed from binary interactions.
  We establish a soundness result showing that, when algebraic violations vanish during training, the learned operator converges to a valid ternary Gamma-semiring. We also outline an evaluation strategy for triadic reasoning tasks such as knowledge-graph completion and rule-based inference. These insights demonstrate that ternary Gamma-semirings provide a mathematically principled and practically effective foundation for learnable symbolic reasoning.</description>

      <title>AEGIS: Preserving privacy of 3D Facial Avatars with Adversarial Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing adoption of photorealistic 3D facial avatars, particularly those utilizing efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, introduces new risks of online identity theft, especially in systems that rely on biometric authentication. While effective adversarial masking methods have been developed for 2D images, a significant gap remains in achieving robust, viewpoint-consistent identity protection for dynamic 3D avatars. To address this, we present AEGIS, the first privacy-preserving identity masking framework for 3D Gaussian Avatars that maintains the subject's perceived characteristics. Our method aims to conceal identity-related facial features while preserving the avatar's perceptual realism and functional integrity. AEGIS applies adversarial perturbations to the Gaussian color coefficients, guided by a pre-trained face verification network, ensuring consistent protection across multiple viewpoints without retraining or modifying the avatar's geometry. AEGIS achieves complete de-identification, reducing face retrieval and verification accuracy to 0%, while maintaining high perceptual quality (SSIM = 0.9555, PSNR = 35.52 dB). It also preserves key facial attributes such as age, race, gender, and emotion, demonstrating strong privacy protection with minimal visual distortion.</description>

      <title>$\Delta$-ML Ensembles for Selecting Quantum Chemistry Methods to Compute Intermolecular Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ab initio quantum chemical methods for accurately computing interactions between molecules have a wide range of applications but are often computationally expensive. Hence, selecting an appropriate method based on accuracy and computational cost remains a significant challenge due to varying performance of methods. In this work, we propose a framework based on an ensemble of $\Delta$-ML models trained on features extracted from a pre-trained atom-pairwise neural network to predict the error of each method relative to all other methods including the ``gold standard'' coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations at the estimated complete basis set limit [CCSD(T)/CBS]. Our proposed approach provides error estimates across various levels of theories and identifies the computationally efficient approach for a given error range utilizing only a subset of the dataset. Further, this approach allows comparison between various theories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using an extended BioFragment dataset, which includes the interaction energies for common biomolecular fragments and small organic dimers. Our results show that the proposed framework achieves very small mean-absolute-errors below 0.1 kcal/mol regardless of the given method. Furthermore, by analyzing all-to-all $\Delta$-ML models for present levels of theory, we identify method groupings that align with theoretical hypotheses, providing evidence that $\Delta$-ML models can easily learn corrections from any level of theory to any other level of theory.</description>

      <title>Episodic Memory in Agentic Frameworks: Suggesting Next Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic frameworks powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) can be useful tools in scientific workflows by enabling human-AI co-creation. A key challenge is recommending the next steps during workflow creation without relying solely on LLMs, which risk hallucination and require fine-tuning with scarce proprietary data. We propose an episodic memory architecture that stores and retrieves past workflows to guide agents in suggesting plausible next tasks. By matching current workflows with historical sequences, agents can recommend steps based on prior patterns.</description>

      <title>Pillar-0: A New Frontier for Radiology Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiology plays an integral role in modern medicine, yet rising imaging volumes have far outpaced workforce growth. Foundation models offer a path toward assisting with the full spectrum of radiology tasks, but existing medical models remain limited: they process volumetric CT and MRI as low-fidelity 2D slices, discard critical grayscale contrast information, and lack evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical practice. We introduce Pillar-0, a radiology foundation model pretrained on 42,990 abdomen-pelvis CTs, 86,411 chest CTs, 14,348 head CTs, and 11,543 breast MRIs from a large academic center, together with RATE, a scalable framework that extracts structured labels for 366 radiologic findings with near-perfect accuracy using LLMs. Across internal test sets of 14,230 abdomen-pelvis CTs, 10,646 chest CTs, 4,906 head CTs, and 1,585 breast MRIs, Pillar-0 establishes a new performance frontier, achieving mean AUROCs of 86.4, 88.0, 90.1, and 82.9, outperforming MedGemma (Google), MedImageInsight (Microsoft), Lingshu (Alibaba), and Merlin (Stanford) by 7.8-15.8 AUROC points and ranking best in 87.2\% (319/366) tasks. Pillar-0 similarly outperforms all baselines in an external validation on the Stanford Abdominal CT dataset, including Merlin (82.2 vs 80.6 AUROC). Pillar-0 extends to tasks beyond its pretraining, such as long-horizon lung cancer risk prediction, where it improves upon the state-of-the-art Sybil by 3.0 C-index points on NLST, and generalizes with gains of 5.9 (MGH) and 1.9 (CGMH). In brain hemorrhage detection, Pillar-0 obtained a &gt;95 AUROC when using only 1/20th of the data of the next most sample efficient baseline. Pillar-0 and RATE together provide an open, clinically rigorous foundation for building high-performance radiology systems, enabling applications that were previously infeasible due to computational, data, and evaluation constraints.</description>

      <title>A Stitch in Time: Learning Procedural Workflow via Self-Supervised Plackett-Luce Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Procedural activities, ranging from routine cooking to complex surgical operations, are highly structured as a set of actions conducted in a specific temporal order. Despite their success on static images and short clips, current self-supervised learning methods often overlook the procedural nature that underpins such activities. We expose the lack of procedural awareness in current SSL methods with a motivating experiment: models pretrained on forward and time-reversed sequences produce highly similar features, confirming that their representations are blind to the underlying procedural order. To address this shortcoming, we propose PL-Stitch, a self-supervised framework that harnesses the inherent temporal order of video frames as a powerful supervisory signal. Our approach integrates two novel probabilistic objectives based on the Plackett-Luce (PL) model. The primary PL objective trains the model to sort sampled frames chronologically, compelling it to learn the global workflow progression. The secondary objective, a spatio-temporal jigsaw loss, complements the learning by capturing fine-grained, cross-frame object correlations. Our approach consistently achieves superior performance across five surgical and cooking benchmarks. Specifically, PL-Stitch yields significant gains in surgical phase recognition (e.g., +11.4 pp k-NN accuracy on Cholec80) and cooking action segmentation (e.g., +5.7 pp linear probing accuracy on Breakfast), demonstrating its effectiveness for procedural video representation learning.</description>

      <title>REXO: Indoor Multi-View Radar Object Detection via 3D Bounding Box Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-view indoor radar perception has drawn attention due to its cost-effectiveness and low privacy risks. Existing methods often rely on {implicit} cross-view radar feature association, such as proposal pairing in RFMask or query-to-feature cross-attention in RETR, which can lead to ambiguous feature matches and degraded detection in complex indoor scenes. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{REXO} (multi-view Radar object dEtection with 3D bounding boX diffusiOn), which lifts the 2D bounding box (BBox) diffusion process of DiffusionDet into the 3D radar space. REXO utilizes these noisy 3D BBoxes to guide an {explicit} cross-view radar feature association, enhancing the cross-view radar-conditioned denoising process. By accounting for prior knowledge that the person is in contact with the ground, REXO reduces the number of diffusion parameters by determining them from this prior. Evaluated on two open indoor radar datasets, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a margin of +4.22 AP on the HIBER dataset and +11.02 AP on the MMVR dataset.</description>

      <title>Importance-Weighted Non-IID Sampling for Flow Matching Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow-matching models effectively represent complex distributions, yet estimating expectations of functions of their outputs remains challenging under limited sampling budgets. Independent sampling often yields high-variance estimates, especially when rare but with high-impact outcomes dominate the expectation. We propose an importance-weighted non-IID sampling framework that jointly draws multiple samples to cover diverse, salient regions of a flow's distribution while maintaining unbiased estimation via estimated importance weights. To balance diversity and quality, we introduce a score-based regularization for the diversity mechanism, which uses the score function, i.e., the gradient of the log probability, to ensure samples are pushed apart within high-density regions of the data manifold, mitigating off-manifold drift. We further develop the first approach for importance weighting of non-IID flow samples by learning a residual velocity field that reproduces the marginal distribution of the non-IID samples. Empirically, our method produces diverse, high-quality samples and accurate estimates of both importance weights and expectations, advancing the reliable characterization of flow-matching model outputs. Our code will be publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Point of Order: Action-Aware LLM Persona Modeling for Realistic Civic Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models offer opportunities to simulate multi-party deliberation, but realistic modeling remains limited by a lack of speaker-attributed data. Transcripts produced via automatic speech recognition (ASR) assign anonymous speaker labels (e.g., Speaker_1), preventing models from capturing consistent human behavior. This work introduces a reproducible pipeline to transform public Zoom recordings into speaker-attributed transcripts with metadata like persona profiles and pragmatic action tags (e.g., [propose_motion]). We release three local government deliberation datasets: Appellate Court hearings, School Board meetings, and Municipal Council sessions. Fine-tuning LLMs to model specific participants using this "action-aware" data produces a 67% reduction in perplexity and nearly doubles classifier-based performance metrics for speaker fidelity and realism. Turing-style human evaluations show our simulations are often indistinguishable from real deliberations, providing a practical and scalable method for complex realistic civic simulations.</description>

      <title>APRIL: Annotations for Policy evaluation with Reliable Inference from LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) estimates the value of a contextual bandit policy prior to deployment. As such, OPE plays a critical role in ensuring safety in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. However, standard OPE approaches are limited by the size and coverage of the behavior dataset. While previous work has explored using expert-labeled counterfactual annotations to enhance dataset coverage, obtaining such annotations is expensive, limiting the scalability of prior approaches. We propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate counterfactual annotations for OPE in medical domains. Our method uses domain knowledge to guide LLMs in predicting how key clinical features evolve under alternate treatments. These predicted features can then be transformed using known reward functions to create counterfactual annotations. We first evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict clinical features across two patient subsets in MIMIC-IV, finding that state-of-the-art LLMs achieve comparable performance. Building on this capacity to predict clinical features, we generate LLM-based counterfactual annotations and incorporate them into an OPE estimator. Our empirical results analyze the benefits of counterfactual annotations under varying degrees of shift between the behavior and target policies. We find that in most cases, the LLM-based counterfactual annotations significantly improve OPE estimates up to a point. We provide an entropy-based metric to identify when additional annotations cease to be useful. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based counterfactual annotations offer a scalable approach for addressing coverage limitations in healthcare datasets, enabling safer deployment of decision-making policies in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Toward explainable AI approaches for breast imaging: adapting foundation models to diverse populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models hold promise for specialized medical imaging tasks, though their effectiveness in breast imaging remains underexplored. This study leverages BiomedCLIP as a foundation model to address challenges in model generalization. BiomedCLIP was adapted for automated BI-RADS breast density classification using multi-modality mammographic data (synthesized 2D images, digital mammography, and digital breast tomosynthesis). Using 96,995 images, we compared single-modality (s2D only) and multi-modality training approaches, addressing class imbalance through weighted contrastive learning. Both approaches achieved similar accuracy (multi-modality: 0.74, single-modality: 0.73), with the multi-modality model offering broader applicability across different imaging modalities and higher AUC values consistently above 0.84 across BI-RADS categories. External validation on the RSNA and EMBED datasets showed strong generalization capabilities (AUC range: 0.80-0.93). GradCAM visualizations confirmed consistent and clinically relevant attention patterns, highlighting the models interpretability and robustness. This research underscores the potential of foundation models for breast imaging applications, paving the way for future extensions for diagnostic tasks.</description>

      <title>Unified Class and Domain Incremental Learning with Mixture of Experts for Indoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor localization using machine learning has gained traction due to the growing demand for location-based services. However, its long-term reliability is hindered by hardware/software variations across mobile devices, which shift the model's input distribution to create domain shifts. Further, evolving indoor environments can introduce new locations over time, expanding the output space to create class shifts, making static machine learning models ineffective over time. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unified continual learning framework for indoor localization called MOELO that, for the first time, jointly addresses domain-incremental and class-incremental learning scenarios. MOELO enables a lightweight, robust, and adaptive localization solution that can be deployed on resource-limited mobile devices and is capable of continual learning in dynamic, heterogeneous real-world settings. This is made possible by a mixture-of-experts architecture, where experts are incrementally trained per region and selected through an equiangular tight frame based gating mechanism ensuring efficient routing, and low-latency inference, all within a compact model footprint. Experimental evaluations show that MOELO achieves improvements of up to 25.6x in mean localization error, 44.5x in worst-case localization error, and 21.5x lesser forgetting compared to state-of-the-art frameworks across diverse buildings, mobile devices, and learning scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale text-to-video diffusion models to add new generative controls, such as those over physical camera parameters (e.g., shutter speed or aperture), typically requires vast, high-fidelity datasets that are difficult to acquire. In this work, we propose a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that learns these controls from sparse, low-quality synthetic data. We show that not only does fine-tuning on such simple data enable the desired controls, it actually yields superior results to models fine-tuned on photorealistic "real" data. Beyond demonstrating these results, we provide a framework that justifies this phenomenon both intuitively and quantitatively.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on enhancing kiosk systems through a low-code architecture, with a focus on AI-based implementations. Modern kiosk systems are confronted with significant challenges, including a lack of integration, structural rigidity, performance bottlenecks, and the absence of collaborative frameworks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a DIZEST-based approach methodology, a specialized low-code platform that enables intuitive workflow design and seamless AI integration. Through a comparative analysis with existing platforms, including Jupyter Notebook, ComfyUI, and Orange3, we demonstrate that DIZEST delivers superior performance across key evaluation criteria. Our photo kiosk case study further validates the effectiveness of this approach in improving interoperability, enhancing user experience, and increasing deployment flexibility.</description>

      <title>A superpersuasive autonomous policy debating system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capacity for highly complex, evidence-based, and strategically adaptive persuasion remains a formidable great challenge for artificial intelligence. Previous work, like IBM Project Debater, focused on generating persuasive speeches in simplified and shortened debate formats intended for relatively lay audiences. We introduce DeepDebater, a novel autonomous system capable of participating in and winning a full, unmodified, two-team competitive policy debate. Our system employs a hierarchical architecture of specialized multi-agent workflows, where teams of LLM-powered agents collaborate and critique one another to perform discrete argumentative tasks. Each workflow utilizes iterative retrieval, synthesis, and self-correction using a massive corpus of policy debate evidence (OpenDebateEvidence) and produces complete speech transcripts, cross-examinations, and rebuttals. We introduce a live, interactive end-to-end presentation pipeline that renders debates with AI speech and animation: transcripts are surface-realized and synthesized to audio with OpenAI TTS, and then displayed as talking-head portrait videos with EchoMimic V1. Beyond fully autonomous matches (AI vs AI), DeepDebater supports hybrid human-AI operation: human debaters can intervene at any stage, and humans can optionally serve as opponents against AI in any speech, allowing AI-human and AI-AI rounds. In preliminary evaluations against human-authored cases, DeepDebater produces qualitatively superior argumentative components and consistently wins simulated rounds as adjudicated by an independent autonomous judge. Expert human debate coaches also prefer the arguments, evidence, and cases constructed by DeepDebater. We open source all code, generated speech transcripts, audio and talking head video here: https://github.com/Hellisotherpeople/DeepDebater/tree/main</description>

      <title>MGA-VQA: Secure and Interpretable Graph-Augmented Visual Question Answering with Memory-Guided Protection Against Unauthorized Knowledge Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) requires models to jointly understand textual semantics, spatial layout, and visual features. Current methods struggle with explicit spatial relationship modeling, inefficiency with high-resolution documents, multi-hop reasoning, and limited interpretability. We propose MGA-VQA, a multi-modal framework that integrates token-level encoding, spatial graph reasoning, memory-augmented inference, and question-guided compression. Unlike prior black-box models, MGA-VQA introduces interpretable graph-based decision pathways and structured memory access for enhanced reasoning transparency. Evaluation across six benchmarks (FUNSD, CORD, SROIE, DocVQA, STE-VQA, and RICO) demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency, with consistent improvements in both answer prediction and spatial localization.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Audio-Visual Dataset Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Dataset Distillation aims to compress large-scale datasets into compact subsets while preserving the performance of the original data. However, conventional Distribution Matching (DM) methods struggle to capture intrinsic cross-modal alignment. Subsequent studies have attempted to introduce cross-modal matching, but two major challenges remain: (i) independently and randomly initialized encoders lead to inconsistent modality mapping spaces, increasing training difficulty; and (ii) direct interactions between modalities tend to damage modality-specific (private) information, thereby degrading the quality of the distilled data. To address these challenges, we propose DAVDD, a pretraining-based decoupled audio-visual distillation framework. DAVDD leverages a diverse pretrained bank to obtain stable modality features and uses a lightweight decoupler bank to disentangle them into common and private representations. To effectively preserve cross-modal structure, we further introduce Common Intermodal Matching together with a Sample-Distribution Joint Alignment strategy, ensuring that shared representations are aligned both at the sample level and the global distribution level. Meanwhile, private representations are entirely isolated from cross-modal interaction, safeguarding modality-specific cues throughout distillation. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DAVDD achieves state-of-the-art results under all IPC settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of decoupled representation learning for high-quality audio-visual dataset distillation. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>Statistically-Guided Dual-Domain Meta-Learning with Adaptive Multi-Prototype Aggregation for Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing (DFOS) has shown strong potential in perimeter security due to its capability of monitoring vibration events across long distances with fine spatial resolution. However, practical DFOS systems face three critical challenges: (1) signal patterns of the same activity vary drastically under different fiber deployment types (e.g., underground, wall-mounted), causing domain shift; (2) labeled data in new deployment scenarios is often scarce or entirely unavailable, limiting model adaptability; and (3) even within source domains, data scarcity makes it difficult to capture intra-class diversity for robust learning.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning framework, DUPLE, for cross-deployment DFOS activity identification. First, a dual-domain multi-prototype learner fuses temporal and frequency domain features, enhancing the model's generalization ability under signal distribution shifts. Second, a Statistical Guided Network (SGN) infers domain importance and prototype sensitivity from raw statistical features, providing data-driven prior information for learning in unlabeled or unseen domains. Third, a query-aware prototype aggregation module adaptively selects and combines relevant prototypes, thereby improving classification performance even with limited data.
  Extensive experiments on cross-deployment DFOS datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in domain generalization settings, enabling robust event recognition across diverse fiber configurations with minimal labeled data.</description>

      <title>AnimAgents: Coordinating Multi-Stage Animation Pre-Production with Human-Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Animation pre-production lays the foundation of an animated film by transforming initial concepts into a coherent blueprint across interdependent stages such as ideation, scripting, design, and storyboarding. While generative AI tools are increasingly adopted in this process, they remain isolated, requiring creators to juggle multiple systems without integrated workflow support. Our formative study with 12 professional creative directors and independent animators revealed key challenges in their current practice: Creators must manually coordinate fragmented outputs, manage large volumes of information, and struggle to maintain continuity and creative control between stages. Based on the insights, we present AnimAgents, a human-multi-agent collaborative system that coordinates complex, multi-stage workflows through a core agent and specialized agents, supported by dedicated boards for the four major stages of pre-production. AnimAgents enables stage-aware orchestration, stage-specific output management, and element-level refinement, providing an end-to-end workflow tailored to professional practice. In a within-subjects summative study with 16 professional creators, AnimAgents significantly outperformed a strong single-agent baseline that equipped with advanced parallel image generation in coordination, consistency, information management, and overall satisfaction (p &lt; .01). A field deployment with 4 creators further demonstrated AnimAgents' effectiveness in real-world projects.</description>

      <title>Principled Context Engineering for RAG: Statistical Guarantees via Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual grounding in large language models (LLMs) by incorporating retrieved evidence, but LLM accuracy declines when long or noisy contexts exceed the model's effective attention span. Existing pre-generation filters rely on heuristics or uncalibrated LLM confidence scores, offering no statistical control over retained evidence. We evaluate and demonstrate context engineering through conformal prediction, a coverage-controlled filtering framework that removes irrelevant content while preserving recall of supporting evidence. Using both embedding- and LLM-based scoring functions, we test this approach on the NeuCLIR and RAGTIME collections. Conformal filtering consistently meets its target coverage, ensuring that a specified fraction of relevant snippets are retained, and reduces retained context by 2-3x relative to unfiltered retrieval. On NeuCLIR, downstream factual accuracy measured by ARGUE F1 improves under strict filtering and remains stable at moderate coverage, indicating that most discarded material is redundant or irrelevant. These results demonstrate that conformal prediction enables reliable, coverage-controlled context reduction in RAG, offering a model-agnostic and principled approach to context engineering.</description>

      <title>Rectifying Soft-Label Entangled Bias in Long-Tailed Dataset Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large-scale datasets into compact, highly informative synthetic data, significantly reducing storage and training costs. However, existing research primarily focuses on balanced datasets and struggles to perform under real-world long-tailed distributions. In this work, we emphasize the critical role of soft labels in long-tailed dataset distillation and uncover the underlying mechanisms contributing to performance degradation. Specifically, we derive an imbalance-aware generalization bound for model trained on distilled dataset. We then identify two primary sources of soft-label bias, which originate from the distillation model and the distilled images, through systematic perturbation of the data imbalance levels. To address this, we propose ADSA, an Adaptive Soft-label Alignment module that calibrates the entangled biases. This lightweight module integrates seamlessly into existing distillation pipelines and consistently improves performance. On ImageNet-1k-LT with EDC and IPC=50, ADSA improves tail-class accuracy by up to 11.8% and raises overall accuracy to 41.4%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADSA provides a robust and generalizable solution under limited label budgets and across a range of distillation techniques.

      <title>Towards Efficient LLM-aware Heterogeneous Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous graphs are widely present in real-world complex networks, where the diversity of node and relation types leads to complex and rich semantics. Efforts for modeling complex relation semantics in heterogeneous graphs are restricted by the limitations of predefined semantic dependencies and the scarcity of supervised signals. The advanced pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm leverages graph structure to provide rich self-supervised signals, but introduces semantic gaps between tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential to address the semantic issues of relations and tasks in heterogeneous graphs through their strong reasoning capabilities in textual modality, but their incorporation into heterogeneous graphs is largely limited by computational complexity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Efficient LLM-Aware (ELLA) framework for heterogeneous graphs, addressing the above issues. To capture complex relation semantics, we propose an LLM-aware Relation Tokenizer that leverages LLM to encode multi-hop, multi-type relations. To reduce computational complexity, we further employ a Hop-level Relation Graph Transformer, which help reduces the complexity of LLM-aware relation reasoning from exponential to linear. To bridge semantic gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, we introduce the fine-grained task-aware textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. Extensive experiments on four heterogeneous graphs show that our proposed ELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the performance and efficiency. In particular, ELLA scales up to 13b-parameter LLMs and achieves up to a 4x speedup compared with existing LLM-based methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/l-wd/ELLA.</description>

      <title>PA-FAS: Towards Interpretable and Generalizable Multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing via Path-Augmented Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) has recently advanced in multimodal fusion, cross-domain generalization, and interpretability. With large language models and reinforcement learning (RL), strategy-based training offers new opportunities to jointly model these aspects. However, multimodal reasoning is more complex than unimodal reasoning, requiring accurate feature representation and cross-modal verification while facing scarce, high-quality annotations, which makes direct application of RL sub-optimal. We identify two key limitations of supervised fine-tuning plus RL (SFT+RL) for multimodal FAS: (1) limited multimodal reasoning paths restrict the use of complementary modalities and shrink the exploration space after SFT, weakening the effect of RL; and (2) mismatched single-task supervision versus diverse reasoning paths causes reasoning confusion, where models may exploit shortcuts by mapping images directly to answers and ignoring the intended reasoning. To address this, we propose PA-FAS, which enhances reasoning paths by constructing high-quality extended reasoning sequences from limited annotations, enriching paths and relaxing exploration constraints. We further introduce an answer-shuffling mechanism during SFT to force comprehensive multimodal analysis instead of using superficial cues, thereby encouraging deeper reasoning and mitigating shortcut learning. PA-FAS significantly improves multimodal reasoning accuracy and cross-domain generalization, and better unifies multimodal fusion, generalization, and interpretability for trustworthy FAS.</description>

      <title>MambaTAD: When State-Space Models Meet Long-Range Temporal Action Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal Action Detection (TAD) aims to identify and localize actions by determining their starting and ending frames within untrimmed videos. Recent Structured State-Space Models such as Mamba have demonstrated potential in TAD due to their long-range modeling capability and linear computational complexity. On the other hand, structured state-space models often face two key challenges in TAD, namely, decay of temporal context due to recursive processing and self-element conflict during global visual context modeling, which become more severe while handling long-span action instances. Additionally, traditional methods for TAD struggle with detecting long-span action instances due to a lack of global awareness and inefficient detection heads. This paper presents MambaTAD, a new state-space TAD model that introduces long-range modeling and global feature detection capabilities for accurate temporal action detection. MambaTAD comprises two novel designs that complement each other with superior TAD performance. First, it introduces a Diagonal-Masked Bidirectional State-Space (DMBSS) module which effectively facilitates global feature fusion and temporal action detection. Second, it introduces a global feature fusion head that refines the detection progressively with multi-granularity features and global awareness. In addition, MambaTAD tackles TAD in an end-to-end one-stage manner using a new state-space temporal adapter(SSTA) which reduces network parameters and computation cost with linear complexity. Extensive experiments show that MambaTAD achieves superior TAD performance consistently across multiple public benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Impact of Lexical Training Data Coverage on Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental challenge, particularly in open-domain question answering. Prior work attempts to detect hallucination with model-internal signals such as token-level entropy or generation consistency, while the connection between pretraining data exposure and hallucination is underexplored. Existing studies show that LLMs underperform on long-tail knowledge, i.e., the accuracy of the generated answer drops for the ground-truth entities that are rare in pretraining. However, examining whether data coverage itself can serve as a detection signal is overlooked. We propose a complementary question: Does lexical training-data coverage of the question and/or generated answer provide additional signal for hallucination detection? To investigate this, we construct scalable suffix arrays over RedPajama's 1.3-trillion-token pretraining corpus to retrieve $n$-gram statistics for both prompts and model generations. We evaluate their effectiveness for hallucination detection across three QA benchmarks. Our observations show that while occurrence-based features are weak predictors when used alone, they yield modest gains when combined with log-probabilities, particularly on datasets with higher intrinsic model uncertainty. These findings suggest that lexical coverage features provide a complementary signal for hallucination detection.

      <title>Towards Automating Data Access Permissions in AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI agents attempt to autonomously act on users' behalf, they raise transparency and control issues. We argue that permission-based access control is indispensable in providing meaningful control to the users, but conventional permission models are inadequate for the automated agentic execution paradigm. We therefore propose automated permission management for AI agents. Our key idea is to conduct a user study to identify the factors influencing users' permission decisions and to encode these factors into an ML-based permission management assistant capable of predicting users' future decisions. We find that participants' permission decisions are influenced by communication context but importantly individual preferences tend to remain consistent within contexts, and align with those of other participants. Leveraging these insights, we develop a permission prediction model achieving 85.1% accuracy overall and 94.4% for high-confidence predictions. We find that even without using permission history, our model achieves an accuracy of 66.9%, and a slight increase of training samples (i.e., 1-4) can substantially increase the accuracy by 10.8%.</description>

      <title>VITAL: Vision-Encoder-centered Pre-training for LMMs in Visual Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing a robust visual quality assessment (VQualA) large multi-modal model (LMM) requires achieving versatility, powerfulness, and transferability.
  However, existing VQualA LMMs typically focus on a single task and rely on full-parameter fine-tuning, which makes them prone to overfitting on specific modalities or task types, thereby limiting their generalization capacity and transferability. To address this, we propose a vision-encoder-centered generative pre-training pipeline and develop the VITAL-Series LMMs. (1) We adopt a machine-executed annotation-scrutiny paradigm, constructing over 4.5M vision-language (VL) pairs-the largest VQualA training dataset to date. (2) We employ a multi-task training workflow that simultaneously enhances the model's quantitative scoring precision and strengthens its capability for quality interpretation across both image and video modalities. (3) Building upon the vision encoder, we realize an efficient model zoo extension: the model zoo exhibits strong zero-shot performance, and each paired decoder requires only a swift warm-up using less than 1/1000 of the pre-training data to achieve performance comparable to the fully trained counterpart. Overall, our work lays a cornerstone for advancing toward the foundation LMM for VQualA.</description>

      <title>Hybrid LSTM and PPO Networks for Dynamic Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid framework for portfolio optimization that fuses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) forecasting with a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning strategy. The proposed system leverages the predictive power of deep recurrent networks to capture temporal dependencies, while the PPO agent adaptively refines portfolio allocations in continuous action spaces, allowing the system to anticipate trends while adjusting dynamically to market shifts. Using multi-asset datasets covering U.S. and Indonesian equities, U.S. Treasuries, and major cryptocurrencies from January 2018 to December 2024, the model is evaluated against several baselines, including equal-weight, index-style, and single-model variants (LSTM-only and PPO-only). The framework's performance is benchmarked against equal-weighted, index-based, and single-model approaches (LSTM-only and PPO-only) using annualized return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown metrics, each adjusted for transaction costs. The results indicate that the hybrid architecture delivers higher returns and stronger resilience under non-stationary market regimes, suggesting its promise as a robust, AI-driven framework for dynamic portfolio optimization.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Design Space Exploration for Tensorized Neural Network Hardware Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-order tensor decomposition has been widely adopted to obtain compact deep neural networks for edge deployment. However, existing studies focus primarily on its algorithmic advantages such as accuracy and compression ratio-while overlooking the hardware deployment efficiency. Such hardware-unaware designs often obscure the potential latency and energy benefits of tensorized models. Although several works attempt to reduce computational cost by optimizing the contraction sequence based on the number of multiply-accumulate operations, they typically neglect the underlying hardware characteristics, resulting in suboptimal real-world performance. We observe that the contraction path, hardware architecture, and dataflow mapping are tightly coupled and must be optimized jointly within a unified design space to maximize deployment efficiency on real devices. To this end, we propose a co-exploration framework that unifies these dimensions within a unified design space for efficient training and inference of tensorized neural networks on edge platforms. The framework formulates a latency oriented search objective and solves it via a global latency-driven exploration across the unified design space to achieve end-to-end model efficiency. The optimized configurations are implemented on a configurable FPGA kernel, achieving up to 4 and 3.85 lower inference and training latency compared with the dense baseline.</description>

      <title>Towards Effective, Stealthy, and Persistent Backdoor Attacks Targeting Graph Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) are pre-trained on diverse source domains and adapted to unseen targets, enabling broad generalization for graph machine learning. Despite that GFMs have attracted considerable attention recently, their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains largely underexplored. A compromised GFM can introduce backdoor behaviors into downstream applications, posing serious security risks. However, launching backdoor attacks against GFMs is non-trivial due to three key challenges. (1) Effectiveness: Attackers lack knowledge of the downstream task during pre-training, complicating the assurance that triggers reliably induce misclassifications into desired classes. (2) Stealthiness: The variability in node features across domains complicates trigger insertion that remains stealthy. (3) Persistence: Downstream fine-tuning may erase backdoor behaviors by updating model parameters. To address these challenges, we propose GFM-BA, a novel Backdoor Attack model against Graph Foundation Models. Specifically, we first design a label-free trigger association module that links the trigger to a set of prototype embeddings, eliminating the need for knowledge about downstream tasks to perform backdoor injection. Then, we introduce a node-adaptive trigger generator, dynamically producing node-specific triggers, reducing the risk of trigger detection while reliably activating the backdoor. Lastly, we develop a persistent backdoor anchoring module that firmly anchors the backdoor to fine-tuning-insensitive parameters, enhancing the persistence of the backdoor under downstream adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and persistence of GFM-BA.</description>

      <title>Plan-X: Instruct Video Generation via Semantic Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual synthesis, yet they often struggle with high-level semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. This limitation frequently leads to visual hallucinations and mis-alignments with user instructions, especially in scenarios involving complex scene understanding, human-object interactions, multi-stage actions, and in-context motion reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Plan-X, a framework that explicitly enforces high-level semantic planning to instruct video generation process. At its core lies a Semantic Planner, a learnable multimodal language model that reasons over the user's intent from both text prompts and visual context, and autoregressively generates a sequence of text-grounded spatio-temporal semantic tokens. These semantic tokens, complementary to high-level text prompt guidance, serve as structured "semantic sketches" over time for the video diffusion model, which has its strength at synthesizing high-fidelity visual details. Plan-X effectively integrates the strength of language models in multimodal in-context reasoning and planning, together with the strength of diffusion models in photorealistic video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework substantially reduces visual hallucinations and enables fine-grained, instruction-aligned video generation consistent with multimodal context.</description>

      <title>Escaping Optimization Stagnation: Taking Steps Beyond Task Arithmetic via Difference Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current methods for editing pre-trained models face significant challenges, primarily high computational costs and limited scalability. Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a promising solution, using simple arithmetic operations-addition and negation-based on task vectors which are the differences between fine-tuned and pre-trained model weights, to efficiently modify model behavior. However, the full potential of task arithmetic remains underexplored, primarily due to limited mechanisms for overcoming optimization stagnation. To address this challenge, we introduce the notion of difference vector, a generalized form of task vectors derived from the historical movements during optimization. Using difference vectors as directed perturbations, we propose the Difference Vector-based Anisotropic Scaling Iterative algorithm (DV-BASI) to enable a continuous optimization process for task arithmetic methods without relying on any additional modules or components. Notably, by leveraging escapability and directional advantages of difference vectors, the average performance on different tasks of the multi-task model merged by DV-BASI may even outperform models individually fine-tuned. Based on this observation, we extend the application of difference vectors to a feasible fine-tuning method for single-task models. On the practical side, DV-BASI allows expressive searching directions with few learnable parameters and forms a scalable framework. We also integrate DV-BASI with task arithmetic methods and advanced optimization techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both supervised and unsupervised evaluation protocols.</description>

      <title>Privacy Auditing of Multi-domain Graph Pre-trained Model under Membership Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-domain graph pre-training has emerged as a pivotal technique in developing graph foundation models. While it greatly improves the generalization of graph neural networks, its privacy risks under membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether a specific instance was used in training (member), remain largely unexplored. However, effectively conducting MIAs against multi-domain graph pre-trained models is a significant challenge due to: (i) Enhanced Generalization Capability: Multi-domain pre-training reduces the overfitting characteristics commonly exploited by MIAs. (ii) Unrepresentative Shadow Datasets: Diverse training graphs hinder the obtaining of reliable shadow graphs. (iii) Weakened Membership Signals: Embedding-based outputs offer less informative cues than logits for MIAs. To tackle these challenges, we propose MGP-MIA, a novel framework for Membership Inference Attacks against Multi-domain Graph Pre-trained models. Specifically, we first propose a membership signal amplification mechanism that amplifies the overfitting characteristics of target models via machine unlearning. We then design an incremental shadow model construction mechanism that builds a reliable shadow model with limited shadow graphs via incremental learning. Finally, we introduce a similarity-based inference mechanism that identifies members based on their similarity to positive and negative samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MGP-MIA and reveal the privacy risks of multi-domain graph pre-training.</description>

      <title>Reward Engineering for Spatial Epidemic Simulations: A Reinforcement Learning Platform for Individual Behavioral Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ContagionRL, a Gymnasium-compatible reinforcement learning platform specifically designed for systematic reward engineering in spatial epidemic simulations. Unlike traditional agent-based models that rely on fixed behavioral rules, our platform enables rigorous evaluation of how reward function design affects learned survival strategies across diverse epidemic scenarios. ContagionRL integrates a spatial SIRS+D epidemiological model with configurable environmental parameters, allowing researchers to stress-test reward functions under varying conditions including limited observability, different movement patterns, and heterogeneous population dynamics. We evaluate five distinct reward designs, ranging from sparse survival bonuses to a novel potential field approach, across multiple RL algorithms (PPO, SAC, A2C). Through systematic ablation studies, we identify that directional guidance and explicit adherence incentives are critical components for robust policy learning. Our comprehensive evaluation across varying infection rates, grid sizes, visibility constraints, and movement patterns reveals that reward function choice dramatically impacts agent behavior and survival outcomes. Agents trained with our potential field reward consistently achieve superior performance, learning maximal adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions while developing sophisticated spatial avoidance strategies. The platform's modular design enables systematic exploration of reward-behavior relationships, addressing a knowledge gap in models of this type where reward engineering has received limited attention. ContagionRL is an effective platform for studying adaptive behavioral responses in epidemic contexts and highlight the importance of reward design, information structure, and environmental predictability in learning.</description>

      <title>Save, Revisit, Retain: A Scalable Framework for Enhancing User Retention in Large-Scale Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User retention is a critical objective for online platforms like Pinterest, as it strengthens user loyalty and drives growth through repeated engagement. A key indicator of retention is revisitation, i.e., when users return to view previously saved content, a behavior often sparked by personalized recommendations and user satisfaction. However, modeling and optimizing revisitation poses significant challenges. One core difficulty is accurate attribution: it is often unclear which specific user actions or content exposures trigger a revisit, since many confounding factors (e.g., content quality, user interface, notifications, or even changing user intent) can influence return behavior. Additionally, the scale and timing of revisitations introduce further complexity; users may revisit content days or even weeks after their initial interaction, requiring the system to maintain and associate extensive historical records across millions of users and sessions. These complexities render existing methods insufficient for robustly capturing and optimizing long-term revisitation. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel, lightweight, and interpretable framework for modeling revisitation behavior and optimizing long-term user retention in Pinterest's search-based recommendation context. By defining a surrogate attribution process that links saves to subsequent revisitations, we reduce noise in the causal relationship between user actions and return visits. Our scalable event aggregation pipeline enables large-scale analysis of user revisitation patterns and enhances the ranking system's ability to surface items with high retention value. Deployed on Pinterest's Related Pins surface to serve 500+ million users, the framework led to a significant lift of 0.1% in active users without additional computational costs.</description>

Abstract: This work explores Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs) and Closed-form Continuous-time Networks (CfCs) for modeling retinal ganglion cell activity in tiger salamanders across three datasets. Compared to a convolutional baseline and an LSTM, both architectures achieved lower MAE, faster convergence, smaller model sizes, and favorable query times, though with slightly lower Pearson correlation. Their efficiency and adaptability make them well suited for scenarios with limited data and frequent retraining, such as edge deployments in vision prosthetics.</description>

      <title>Extracting Interaction-Aware Monosemantic Concepts in Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for extracting \emph{monosemantic} neurons, defined as latent dimensions that align with coherent and interpretable concepts, from user and item embeddings in recommender systems. Our approach employs a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to reveal semantic structure within pretrained representations. In contrast to work on language models, monosemanticity in recommendation must preserve the interactions between separate user and item embeddings. To achieve this, we introduce a \emph{prediction aware} training objective that backpropagates through a frozen recommender and aligns the learned latent structure with the model's user-item affinity predictions. The resulting neurons capture properties such as genre, popularity, and temporal trends, and support post hoc control operations including targeted filtering and content promotion without modifying the base model. Our method generalizes across different recommendation models and datasets, providing a practical tool for interpretable and controllable personalization.

      <title>Hierarchical biomarker thresholding: a model-agnostic framework for stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biomarker pipelines require patient-level decisions aggregated from instance-level (cell/patch) scores. Thresholds tuned on pooled instances often fail across sites due to hierarchical dependence, prevalence shift, and score-scale mismatch. We present a selection-honest framework for hierarchical thresholding that makes patient-level decisions reproducible and more defensible. At its core is a risk decomposition theorem for selection-honest thresholds. The theorem separates contributions from (i) internal fit and patient-level generalization, (ii) operating-point shift reflecting prevalence and shape changes, and (iii) a stability term that penalizes sensitivity to threshold perturbations. The stability component is computable via patient-block bootstraps mapped through a monotone modulus of risk. This framework is model-agnostic, reconciles heterogeneous decision rules on a quantile scale, and yields monotone-invariant ensembles and reportable diagnostics (e.g. flip-rate, operating-point shift).</description>

      <title>MASTEST: A LLM-Based Multi-Agent System For RESTful API Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Testing RESTful API is increasingly important in quality assurance of cloud-native applications. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated that various testing activities can be performed automatically by large language models (LLMs) with reasonable accuracy. This paper develops a multi-agent system called MASTEST that combines LLM-based and programmed agents to form a complete tool chain that covers the whole workflow of API test starting from generating unit and system test scenarios from API specification in the OpenAPI Swagger format, to generating of Pytest test scripts, executing test scripts to interact with web services, to analysing web service response messages to determine test correctness and calculate test coverage. The system also supports the incorporation of human testers in reviewing and correcting LLM generated test artefacts to ensure the quality of testing activities. MASTEST system is evaluated on two LLMs, GPT-4o and DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner with five public APIs. The performances of LLMs on various testing activities are measured by a wide range of metrics, including unit and system test scenario coverage and API operation coverage for the quality of generated test scenarios, data type correctness, status code coverage and script syntax correctness for the quality of LLM generated test scripts, as well as bug detection ability and usability of LLM generated test scenarios and scripts. Experiment results demonstrated that both DeepSeek and GPT-4o achieved a high overall performance. DeepSeek excels in data type correctness and status code detection, while GPT-4o performs best in API operation coverage. For both models, LLM generated test scripts maintained 100\% syntax correctness and only required minimal manual edits for semantic correctness. These findings indicate the effectiveness and feasibility of MASTEST.</description>

      <title>Fidelity-Aware Recommendation Explanations via Stochastic Path Integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explanation fidelity, which measures how accurately an explanation reflects a model's true reasoning, remains critically underexplored in recommender systems. We introduce SPINRec (Stochastic Path Integration for Neural Recommender Explanations), a model-agnostic approach that adapts path-integration techniques to the sparse and implicit nature of recommendation data. To overcome the limitations of prior methods, SPINRec employs stochastic baseline sampling: instead of integrating from a fixed or unrealistic baseline, it samples multiple plausible user profiles from the empirical data distribution and selects the most faithful attribution path. This design captures the influence of both observed and unobserved interactions, yielding more stable and personalized explanations. We conduct the most comprehensive fidelity evaluation to date across three models (MF, VAE, NCF), three datasets (ML1M, Yahoo! Music, Pinterest), and a suite of counterfactual metrics, including AUC-based perturbation curves and fixed-length diagnostics. SPINRec consistently outperforms all baselines, establishing a new benchmark for faithful explainability in recommendation. Code and evaluation tools are publicly available at https://github.com/DeltaLabTLV/SPINRec.</description>

      <title>IE-Critic-R1: Advancing the Explanatory Measurement of Text-Driven Image Editing for Human Perception Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-driven image editing have been significant, yet the task of accurately evaluating these edited images continues to pose a considerable challenge. Different from the assessment of text-driven image generation, text-driven image editing is characterized by simultaneously conditioning on both text and a source image. The edited images often retain an intrinsic connection to the original image, which dynamically change with the semantics of the text. However, previous methods tend to solely focus on text-image alignment or have not well aligned with human perception. In this work, we introduce the Text-driven Image Editing Benchmark suite (IE-Bench) to enhance the assessment of text-driven edited images. IE-Bench includes a database contains diverse source images, various editing prompts and the corresponding edited results from different editing methods, and nearly 4,000 samples with corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) provided by 15 human subjects. Furthermore, we introduce IE-Critic-R1, which, benefiting from Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), provides more comprehensive and explainable quality assessment for text-driven image editing that aligns with human perception.

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Optimization with a Financial Goal and Defined Time Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research proposes an enhancement to the innovative portfolio optimization approach using the G-Learning algorithm, combined with parametric optimization via the GIRL algorithm (G-learning approach to the setting of Inverse Reinforcement Learning) as presented by. The goal is to maximize portfolio value by a target date while minimizing the investor's periodic contributions. Our model operates in a highly volatile market with a well-diversified portfolio, ensuring a low-risk level for the investor, and leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust portfolio positions over time. Results show that we improved the Sharpe Ratio from 0.42, as suggested by recent studies using the same approach, to a value of 0.483 a notable achievement in highly volatile markets with diversified portfolios. The comparison between G-Learning and GIRL reveals that while GIRL optimizes the reward function parameters (e.g., lambda = 0.0012 compared to 0.002), its impact on portfolio performance remains marginal. This suggests that reinforcement learning methods, like G-Learning, already enable robust optimization. This research contributes to the growing development of reinforcement learning applications in financial decision-making, demonstrating that probabilistic learning algorithms can effectively align portfolio management strategies with investor needs.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Surrogate Model for Time-varying Underwater Acoustic Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of time-varying underwater acoustic channels is essential for the design, evaluation, and deployment of reliable underwater communication systems. Conventional physics models require detailed environmental knowledge, while stochastic replay methods are constrained by the limited diversity of measured channels and often fail to generalize to unseen scenarios, reducing their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose StableUASim, a pre-trained conditional latent diffusion surrogate model that captures the stochastic dynamics of underwater acoustic communication channels. Leveraging generative modeling, StableUASim produces diverse and statistically realistic channel realizations, while supporting conditional generation from specific measurement samples. Pre-training enables rapid adaptation to new environments using minimal additional data, and the autoencoder latent representation facilitates efficient channel analysis and compression. Experimental results demonstrate that StableUASim accurately reproduces key channel characteristics and communication performance, providing a scalable, data-efficient, and physically consistent surrogate model for both system design and machine learning-driven underwater applications.</description>

      <title>The Alignment Paradox of Medical Large Language Models in Infertility Care: Decoupling Algorithmic Improvement from Clinical Decision-making Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support, yet aligning them with the multifaceted reasoning pathways of real-world medicine remains a major challenge. Using more than 8,000 infertility treatment records, we systematically evaluate four alignment strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and In-Context Learning (ICL) through a dual-layer framework combining automatic benchmarks with blinded doctor-in-the-loop assessments. GRPO achieves the highest algorithmic accuracy across multiple decision layers, confirming the value of reinforcement-based optimization for structured prediction tasks. However, clinicians consistently prefer the SFT model, citing clearer reasoning processes (p = 0.035) and higher therapeutic feasibility (p = 0.019). In blinded pairwise comparisons, SFT attains the highest winning rate (51.2%), outperforming both GRPO (26.2%) and even physicians' original decisions (22.7%). These results reveal an alignment paradox: algorithmic improvements do not necessarily translate into higher clinical trust, and may diverge from human-centered preferences. Our findings highlight the need for alignment strategies that prioritize clinically interpretable and practically feasible reasoning, rather than solely optimizing decision-level accuracy.</description>

      <title>Continually Evolving Skill Knowledge in Vision Language Action Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing general robot intelligence in open environments requires continual skill learning. Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage massive pretraining data to support diverse manipulation tasks, but they still depend heavily on task-specific fine-tuning, revealing a lack of continual learning capability. Existing continual learning methods are also resource-intensive to scale to VLA models. We propose Stellar VLA, a knowledge-driven continual learning framework with two variants: T-Stellar, modeling task-centric knowledge space, and TS-Stellar, capturing hierarchical task-skill structure. Stellar VLA enables self-supervised knowledge evolution through joint learning of task latent representation and the knowledge space, reducing annotation needs. Knowledge-guided expert routing provide task specialization without extra network parameters, lowering training overhead.Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world tasks show over 50 percentage average improvement in final success rates relative to baselines. TS-Stellar further excels in complex action inference, and in-depth analyses verify effective knowledge retention and discovery. Our code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>A New Error Temporal Difference Algorithm for Deep Reinforcement Learning in Microgrid Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive control approaches based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have gained significant attention in microgrid energy optimization. However, existing research often overlooks the issue of uncertainty stemming from imperfect prediction models, which can lead to suboptimal control strategies. This paper presents a new error temporal difference (ETD) algorithm for DRL to address the uncertainty in predictions,aiming to improve the performance of microgrid operations. First,a microgrid system integrated with renewable energy sources (RES) and energy storage systems (ESS), along with its Markov decision process (MDP), is modelled. Second, a predictive control approach based on a deep Q network (DQN) is presented, in which a weighted average algorithm and a new ETD algorithm are designed to quantify and address the prediction uncertainty, respectively. Finally, simulations on a realworld US dataset suggest that the developed ETD effectively improves the performance of DRL in optimizing microgrid operations.</description>

      <title>VCU-Bridge: Hierarchical Visual Connotation Understanding via Semantic Bridging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmarks, their processing paradigm differs from the human ability to integrate visual information. Unlike humans who naturally bridge details and high-level concepts, models tend to treat these elements in isolation. Prevailing evaluation protocols often decouple low-level perception from high-level reasoning, overlooking their semantic and causal dependencies, which yields non-diagnostic results and obscures performance bottlenecks. We present VCU-Bridge, a framework that operationalizes a human-like hierarchy of visual connotation understanding: multi-level reasoning that advances from foundational perception through semantic bridging to abstract connotation, with an explicit evidence-to-inference trace from concrete cues to abstract conclusions. Building on this framework, we construct HVCU-Bench, a benchmark for hierarchical visual connotation understanding with explicit, level-wise diagnostics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate a consistent decline in performance as reasoning progresses to higher levels. We further develop a data generation pipeline for instruction tuning guided by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and show that strengthening low-level capabilities yields measurable gains at higher levels. Interestingly, it not only improves on HVCU-Bench but also brings benefits on general benchmarks (average +2.53%), especially with substantial gains on MMStar (+7.26%), demonstrating the significance of the hierarchical thinking pattern and its effectiveness in enhancing MLLM capabilities.

      <title>Bias Is a Subspace, Not a Coordinate: A Geometric Rethinking of Post-hoc Debiasing in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become indispensable for multimodal reasoning, yet their representations often encode and amplify demographic biases, resulting in biased associations and misaligned predictions in downstream tasks. Such behavior undermines fairness and distorts the intended alignment between vision and language. Recent post-hoc approaches attempt to mitigate bias by replacing the most attribute-correlated embedding coordinates with neutral values. However, our systematic analysis reveals three critical failures of this coordinate-wise approach: feature entanglement, poor cross-dataset generalization, and incomplete bias removal. We find that bias is not localized to a few coordinates but is instead distributed across a few linear subspaces. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{S}$ubspace $\textbf{P}$rojection $\textbf{D}$ebiasing ($\textbf{SPD}$), a geometrically principled framework that identifies and removes the entire subspace of linearly decodable bias while reinserting a neutral mean component to preserve semantic fidelity. Extensive experiments across zero-shot classification, text-to-image retrieval, and image generation validate the effectiveness of SPD: our method achieves more robust debiasing with an average improvement of $18.5\%$ across four fairness metrics, while maintaining minimal loss in task performance compared to the best debiasing baseline.</description>

      <title>SCALER: SAM-Enhanced Collaborative Learning for Label-Deficient Concealed Object Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for label-deficient concealed object segmentation (LDCOS) either rely on consistency constraints or Segment Anything Model (SAM)-based pseudo-labeling. However, their performance remains limited due to the intrinsic concealment of targets and the scarcity of annotations. This study investigates two key questions: (1) Can consistency constraints and SAM-based supervision be jointly integrated to better exploit complementary information and enhance the segmenter? and (2) beyond that, can the segmenter in turn guide SAM through reciprocal supervision, enabling mutual improvement? To answer these questions, we present SCALER, a unified collaborative framework toward LDCOS that jointly optimizes a mean-teacher segmenter and a learnable SAM. SCALER operates in two alternating phases. In \textbf{Phase \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}}, the segmenter is optimized under fixed SAM supervision using entropy-based image-level and uncertainty-based pixel-level weighting to select reliable pseudo-label regions and emphasize harder examples. In \textbf{Phase \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}}, SAM is updated via augmentation invariance and noise resistance losses, leveraging its inherent robustness to perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that SCALER yields consistent performance gains across eight semi- and weakly-supervised COS tasks. The results further suggest that SCALER can serve as a general training paradigm to enhance both lightweight segmenters and large foundation models under label-scarce conditions. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks vs Convolutional Neural Networks for Graph Domination Number Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate machine learning approaches to approximating the \emph{domination number} of graphs, the minimum size of a dominating set. Exact computation of this parameter is NP-hard, restricting classical methods to small instances. We compare two neural paradigms: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which operate on adjacency matrix representations, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which learn directly from graph structure through message passing. Across 2,000 random graphs with up to 64 vertices, GNNs achieve markedly higher accuracy ($R^2=0.987$, MAE $=0.372$) than CNNs ($R^2=0.955$, MAE $=0.500$). Both models offer substantial speedups over exact solvers, with GNNs delivering more than $200\times$ acceleration while retaining near-perfect fidelity. Our results position GNNs as a practical surrogate for combinatorial graph invariants, with implications for scalable graph optimization and mathematical discovery.</description>

      <title>UnfoldLDM: Deep Unfolding-based Blind Image Restoration with Latent Diffusion Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) combine the interpretability of model-based methods with the learning ability of deep networks, yet remain limited for blind image restoration (BIR). Existing DUNs suffer from: (1) \textbf{Degradation-specific dependency}, as their optimization frameworks are tied to a known degradation model, making them unsuitable for BIR tasks; and (2) \textbf{Over-smoothing bias}, resulting from the direct feeding of gradient descent outputs, dominated by low-frequency content, into the proximal term, suppressing fine textures. To overcome these issues, we propose UnfoldLDM to integrate DUNs with latent diffusion model (LDM) for BIR. In each stage, UnfoldLDM employs a multi-granularity degradation-aware (MGDA) module as the gradient descent step. MGDA models BIR as an unknown degradation estimation problem and estimates both the holistic degradation matrix and its decomposed forms, enabling robust degradation removal. For the proximal step, we design a degradation-resistant LDM (DR-LDM) to extract compact degradation-invariant priors from the MGDA output. Guided by this prior, an over-smoothing correction transformer (OCFormer) explicitly recovers high-frequency components and enhances texture details. This unique combination ensures the final result is degradation-free and visually rich. Experiments show that our UnfoldLDM achieves a leading place on various BIR tasks and benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, our design is compatible with existing DUN-based methods, serving as a plug-and-play framework. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>Nested Unfolding Network for Real-World Concealed Object Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have recently advanced concealed object segmentation (COS) by modeling segmentation as iterative foreground-background separation. However, existing DUN-based methods (RUN) inherently couple background estimation with image restoration, leading to conflicting objectives and requiring pre-defined degradation types, which are unrealistic in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose the nested unfolding network (NUN), a unified framework for real-world COS. NUN adopts a DUN-in-DUN design, embedding a degradation-resistant unfolding network (DeRUN) within each stage of a segmentation-oriented unfolding network (SODUN). This design decouples restoration from segmentation while allowing mutual refinement. Guided by a vision-language model (VLM), DeRUN dynamically infers degradation semantics and restores high-quality images without explicit priors, whereas SODUN performs reversible estimation to refine foreground and background. Leveraging the multi-stage nature of unfolding, NUN employs image-quality assessment to select the best DeRUN outputs for subsequent stages, naturally introducing a self-consistency loss that enhances robustness. Extensive experiments show that NUN achieves a leading place on both clean and degraded benchmarks. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>Towards a General Framework for HTN Modeling with LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating Automated Planning (AP) models has been widely explored; however, their application to Hierarchical Planning (HP) is still far from reaching the level of sophistication observed in non-hierarchical architectures. In this work, we try to address this gap. We present two main contributions. First, we propose L2HP, an extension of L2P (a library to LLM-driven PDDL models generation) that support HP model generation and follows a design philosophy of generality and extensibility. Second, we apply our framework to perform experiments where we compare the modeling capabilities of LLMs for AP and HP. On the PlanBench dataset, results show that parsing success is limited but comparable in both settings (around 36\%), while syntactic validity is substantially lower in the hierarchical case (1\% vs. 20\% of instances). These findings underscore the unique challenges HP presents for LLMs, highlighting the need for further research to improve the quality of generated HP models.</description>

      <title>MEDIC: a network for monitoring data quality in collider experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) is a crucial component of particle physics experiments and ensures that the recorded data is of the highest quality, and suitable for subsequent physics analysis. Due to the extreme environmental conditions, unprecedented data volumes, and the sheer scale and complexity of the detectors, DQM orchestration has become a very challenging task. Therefore, the use of Machine Learning (ML) to automate anomaly detection, improve efficiency, and reduce human error in the process of collecting high-quality data is unavoidable. Since DQM relies on real experimental data, it is inherently tied to the specific detector substructure and technology in operation. In this work, a simulation-driven approach to DQM is proposed, enabling the study and development of data-quality methodologies in a controlled environment. Using a modified version of Delphes -- a fast, multi-purpose detector simulation -- the preliminary realization of a framework is demonstrated which leverages ML to identify detector anomalies as well as localize the malfunctioning components responsible. We introduce MEDIC (Monitoring for Event Data Integrity and Consistency), a neural network designed to learn detector behavior and perform DQM tasks to look for potential faults. Although the present implementation adopts a simplified setup for computational ease, where large detector regions are deliberately deactivated to mimic faults, this work represents an initial step toward a comprehensive ML-based DQM framework. The encouraging results underline the potential of simulation-driven studies as a foundation for developing more advanced, data-driven DQM systems for future particle detectors.</description>

      <title>MOMA-AC: A preference-driven actor-critic framework for continuous multi-objective multi-agent reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a critical gap in Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MOMARL) by introducing the first dedicated inner-loop actor-critic framework for continuous state and action spaces: Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MOMA-AC). Building on single-objective, single-agent algorithms, we instantiate this framework with Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), yielding MOMA-TD3 and MOMA-DDPG. The framework combines a multi-headed actor network, a centralised critic, and an objective preference-conditioning architecture, enabling a single neural network to encode the Pareto front of optimal trade-off policies for all agents across conflicting objectives in a continuous MOMARL setting. We also outline a natural test suite for continuous MOMARL by combining a pre-existing multi-agent single-objective physics simulator with its multi-objective single-agent counterpart. Evaluating cooperative locomotion tasks in this suite, we show that our framework achieves statistically significant improvements in expected utility and hypervolume relative to outer-loop and independent training baselines, while demonstrating stable scalability as the number of agents increases. These results establish our framework as a foundational step towards robust, scalable multi-objective policy learning in continuous multi-agent domains.</description>

      <title>The Workflow as Medium: A Framework for Navigating Human-AI Co-Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Creative Intelligence Loop (CIL), a novel socio-technical framework for responsible human-AI co-creation. Rooted in the 'Workflow as Medium' paradigm, the CIL proposes a disciplined structure for dynamic human-AI collaboration, guiding the strategic integration of diverse AI teammates who function as collaborators while the human remains the final arbiter for ethical alignment and creative integrity. The CIL was empirically demonstrated through the practice-led creation of two graphic novellas, investigating how AI could serve as an effective creative colleague within a subjective medium lacking objective metrics. The process required navigating multifaceted challenges including AI's 'jagged frontier' of capabilities, sycophancy, and attention-scarce feedback environments. This prompted iterative refinement of teaming practices, yielding emergent strategies: a multi-faceted critique system integrating adversarial AI roles to counter sycophancy, and prioritizing 'feedback-ready' concrete artifacts to elicit essential human critique. The resulting graphic novellas analyze distinct socio-technical governance failures: 'The Steward' examines benevolent AI paternalism in smart cities, illustrating how algorithmic hubris can erode freedom; 'Fork the Vote' probes democratic legitimacy by comparing centralized AI opacity with emergent collusion in federated networks. This work contributes a self-improving framework for responsible human-AI co-creation and two graphic novellas designed to foster AI literacy and dialogue through accessible narrative analysis of AI's societal implications.</description>

      <title>ARIAL: An Agentic Framework for Document VQA with Precise Answer Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires models to not only extract accurate textual answers but also precisely localize them within document images, a capability critical for interpretability in high-stakes applications. However, existing systems achieve strong textual accuracy while producing unreliable spatial grounding, or sacrifice performance for interpretability. We present ARIAL (Agentic Reasoning for Interpretable Answer Localization), a modular framework that orchestrates specialized tools through an LLM-based planning agent to achieve both precise answer extraction and reliable spatial grounding. ARIAL decomposes Document VQA into structured subtasks: OCR-based text extraction with TrOCR, retrieval-augmented context selection using semantic search, answer generation via a fine-tuned Gemma 3-27B model, and explicit bounding-box localization through text-to-region alignment. This modular architecture produces transparent reasoning traces, enabling tool-level auditability and independent component optimization. We evaluate ARIAL on four benchmarks (DocVQA, FUNSD, CORD, and SROIE) using both textual accuracy (ANLS) and spatial precision (mAP at IoU 0.50 to 0.95). ARIAL achieves state-of-the-art results across all datasets: 88.7 ANLS and 50.1 mAP on DocVQA, 90.0 ANLS and 50.3 mAP on FUNSD, 85.5 ANLS and 60.2 mAP on CORD, and 93.1 ANLS on SROIE, surpassing the previous best method (DLaVA) by +2.8 ANLS and +3.9 mAP on DocVQA. Our work demonstrates how agentic orchestration of specialized tools can simultaneously improve performance and interpretability, providing a pathway toward trustworthy, explainable document AI systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Large Language Models for Automated Homework Assessment in Undergraduate Circuit Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research full paper presents an enhancement pipeline for large language models (LLMs) in assessing homework for an undergraduate circuit analysis course, aiming to improve LLMs' capacity to provide personalized support to electrical engineering students. Existing evaluations have demonstrated that GPT-4o possesses promising capabilities in assessing student homework in this domain. Building on these findings, we enhance GPT-4o's performance through multi-step prompting, contextual data augmentation, and the incorporation of targeted hints. These strategies effectively address common errors observed in GPT-4o's responses when using simple prompts, leading to a substantial improvement in assessment accuracy. Specifically, the correct response rate for GPT-4o increases from 74.71% to 97.70% after applying the enhanced prompting and augmented data on entry-level circuit analysis topics. This work lays a foundation for the effective integration of LLMs into circuit analysis instruction and, more broadly, into engineering education.</description>

      <title>A Novel and Practical Universal Adversarial Perturbations against Deep Reinforcement Learning based Intrusion Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a vital role in defending modern cyber physical systems against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Deep Reinforcement Learning-based IDS, have shown promise due to their adaptive and generalization capabilities. However, recent studies reveal their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, including Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), which can deceive models with a single, input-agnostic perturbation. In this work, we propose a novel UAP attack against Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based IDS under the domain-specific constraints derived from network data rules and feature relationships. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing study that has explored UAP generation for the DRL-based IDS. In addition, this is the first work that focuses on developing a UAP against a DRL-based IDS under realistic domain constraints based on not only the basic domain rules but also mathematical relations between the features. Furthermore, we enhance the evasion performance of the proposed UAP, by introducing a customized loss function based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, and we denote it as Customized UAP. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work using the PCC value in the UAP generation, even in the broader context. Four additional established UAP baselines are implemented for a comprehensive comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Customized UAP outperforms two input-dependent attacks including Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), and four UAP baselines, highlighting its effectiveness for real-world adversarial scenarios.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Help Allocate Public Health Resources? A Case Study on Childhood Lead Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public health agencies face critical challenges in identifying high-risk neighborhoods for childhood lead exposure with limited resources for outreach and intervention programs. To address this, we develop a Priority Score integrating untested children proportions, elevated blood lead prevalence, and public health coverage patterns to support optimized resource allocation decisions across 136 neighborhoods in Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. We leverage these allocation tasks, which require integrating multiple vulnerability indicators and interpreting empirical evidence, to evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) with agentic reasoning and deep research capabilities can effectively allocate public health resources when presented with structured allocation scenarios. LLMs were tasked with distributing 1,000 test kits within each city based on neighborhood vulnerability indicators. Results reveal significant limitations: LLMs frequently overlooked neighborhoods with highest lead prevalence and largest proportions of untested children, such as West Englewood in Chicago, while allocating disproportionate resources to lower-priority areas like Hunts Point in New York City. Overall accuracy averaged 0.46, reaching a maximum of 0.66 with ChatGPT 5 Deep Research. Despite their marketed deep research capabilities, LLMs struggled with fundamental limitations in information retrieval and evidence-based reasoning, frequently citing outdated data and allowing non-empirical narratives about neighborhood conditions to override quantitative vulnerability indicators.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Agentic AI and Multi-Agent Systems in Smart Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of Agentic AI and MAS enables a new paradigm for intelligent decision making in SMS. Traditional MAS architectures emphasize distributed coordination and specialized autonomy, while recent advances in agentic AI driven by LLMs introduce higher order reasoning, planning, and tool orchestration capabilities. This paper presents a hybrid agentic AI and multi agent framework for a Prescriptive Maintenance use case, where LLM based agents provide strategic orchestration and adaptive reasoning, complemented by rule based and SLMs agents performing efficient, domain specific tasks on the edge. The proposed framework adopts a layered architecture that consists of perception, preprocessing, analytics, and optimization layers, coordinated through an LLM Planner Agent that manages workflow decisions and context retention. Specialized agents autonomously handle schema discovery, intelligent feature analysis, model selection, and prescriptive optimization, while a HITL interface ensures transparency and auditability of generated maintenance recommendations. This hybrid design supports dynamic model adaptation, cost efficient maintenance scheduling, and interpretable decision making. An initial proof of concept implementation is validated on two industrial manufacturing datasets. The developed framework is modular and extensible, supporting seamless integration of new agents or domain modules as capabilities evolve. The results demonstrate the system capability to automatically detect schema, adapt preprocessing pipelines, optimize model performance through adaptive intelligence, and generate actionable, prioritized maintenance recommendations. The framework shows promise in achieving improved robustness, scalability, and explainability for RxM in smart manufacturing, bridging the gap between high level agentic reasoning and low level autonomous execution.</description>

      <title>LLM Reasoning for Cold-Start Item Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for improving recommendation systems through their inherent reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge base. Yet, existing studies predominantly address warm-start scenarios with abundant user-item interaction data, leaving the more challenging cold-start scenarios, where sparse interactions hinder traditional collaborative filtering methods, underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose novel reasoning strategies designed for cold-start item recommendations within the Netflix domain. Our method utilizes the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs to effectively infer user preferences, particularly for newly introduced or rarely interacted items. We systematically evaluate supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, and hybrid approaches that combine both methods to optimize recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate significant improvements in both methodological efficacy and practical performance in cold-start recommendation contexts. Remarkably, our reasoning-based fine-tuned models outperform Netflix's production ranking model by up to 8% in certain cases.</description>

      <title>Beyond Words and Pixels: A Benchmark for Implicit World Knowledge Reasoning in Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models today are capable of producing photorealistic, instruction-following images, yet they still frequently fail on prompts that require implicit world knowledge. Existing evaluation protocols either emphasize compositional alignment or rely on single-round VQA-based scoring, leaving critical dimensions such as knowledge grounding, multi-physics interactions, and auditable evidence-substantially undertested. To address these limitations, we introduce PicWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark that assesses the grasp of implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning of T2I models. This benchmark consists of 1,100 prompts across three core categories. To facilitate fine-grained evaluation, we propose PW-Agent, an evidence-grounded multi-agent evaluator to hierarchically assess images on their physical realism and logical consistency by decomposing prompts into verifiable visual evidence. We conduct a thorough analysis of 17 mainstream T2I models on PicWorld, illustrating that they universally exhibit a fundamental limitation in their capacity for implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning to varying degrees. The findings highlight the need for reasoning-aware, knowledge-integrative architectures in future T2I systems.</description>

      <title>Clinician-Directed Large Language Model Software Generation for Therapeutic Interventions in Physical Rehabilitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital health interventions are increasingly used in physical and occupational therapy to deliver home exercise programs via sensor equipped devices such as smartphones, enabling remote monitoring of adherence and performance. However, digital interventions are typically programmed as software before clinical encounters as libraries of parametrized exercise modules targeting broad patient populations. At the point of care, clinicians can only select modules and adjust a narrow set of parameters like repetitions, so patient specific needs that emerge during encounters, such as distinct movement limitations, and home environments, are rarely reflected in the software. We evaluated a digital intervention paradigm that uses large language models (LLMs) to translate clinicians' exercise prescriptions into intervention software. In a prospective single arm feasibility study with 20 licensed physical and occupational therapists and a standardized patient, clinicians created 40 individualized upper extremity programs (398 instructions) that were automatically translated into executable software. Our results show a 45% increase in the proportion of personalized prescriptions that can be implemented as software compared with a template based benchmark, with unanimous consensus among therapists on ease of use. The LLM generated software correctly delivered 99.78% (397/398) of instructions as prescribed and monitored performance with 88.4% (352/398) accuracy, with 90% (18/20) of therapists judged it safe to interact with patients, and 75% (15/20) expressed willingness to adopt it. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective evaluation of clinician directed intervention software generation with LLMs in healthcare, demonstrating feasibility and motivating larger trials to assess clinical effectiveness and safety in real patient populations.</description>

      <title>Uni-DAD: Unified Distillation and Adaptation of Diffusion Models for Few-step Few-shot Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) produce high-quality images, yet their sampling remains costly when adapted to new domains. Distilled DMs are faster but typically remain confined within their teacher's domain. Thus, fast and high-quality generation for novel domains relies on two-stage training pipelines: Adapt-then-Distill or Distill-then-Adapt. However, both add design complexity and suffer from degraded quality or diversity. We introduce Uni-DAD, a single-stage pipeline that unifies distillation and adaptation of DMs. It couples two signals during training: (i) a dual-domain distribution-matching distillation objective that guides the student toward the distributions of the source teacher and a target teacher, and (ii) a multi-head generative adversarial network (GAN) loss that encourages target realism across multiple feature scales. The source domain distillation preserves diverse source knowledge, while the multi-head GAN stabilizes training and reduces overfitting, especially in few-shot regimes. The inclusion of a target teacher facilitates adaptation to more structurally distant domains. We perform evaluations on a variety of datasets for few-shot image generation (FSIG) and subject-driven personalization (SDP). Uni-DAD delivers higher quality than state-of-the-art (SoTA) adaptation methods even with less than 4 sampling steps, and outperforms two-stage training pipelines in both quality and diversity.</description>

      <title>SwiftVGGT: A Scalable Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer for Large-Scale Scenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D reconstruction in large-scale scenes is a fundamental task in 3D perception, but the inherent trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. Existing methods either prioritize speed and produce low-quality results, or achieve high-quality reconstruction at the cost of slow inference times. In this paper, we propose SwiftVGGT, a training-free method that significantly reduce inference time while preserving high-quality dense 3D reconstruction. To maintain global consistency in large-scale scenes, SwiftVGGT performs loop closure without relying on the external Visual Place Recognition (VPR) model. This removes redundant computation and enables accurate reconstruction over kilometer-scale environments. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective point sampling method to align neighboring chunks using a single Sim(3)-based Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) step. This eliminates the need for the Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) optimization commonly used in prior work, leading to substantial speed-ups. We evaluate SwiftVGGT on multiple datasets and show that it achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while requiring only 33% of the inference time of recent VGGT-based large-scale reconstruction approaches.</description>

      <title>MultiDiffNet: A Multi-Objective Diffusion Framework for Generalizable Brain Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural decoding from electroencephalography (EEG) remains fundamentally limited by poor generalization to unseen subjects, driven by high inter-subject variability and the lack of large-scale datasets to model it effectively. Existing methods often rely on synthetic subject generation or simplistic data augmentation, but these strategies fail to scale or generalize reliably. We introduce \textit{MultiDiffNet}, a diffusion-based framework that bypasses generative augmentation entirely by learning a compact latent space optimized for multiple objectives. We decode directly from this space and achieve state-of-the-art generalization across various neural decoding tasks using subject and session disjoint evaluation. We also curate and release a unified benchmark suite spanning four EEG decoding tasks of increasing complexity (SSVEP, Motor Imagery, P300, and Imagined Speech) and an evaluation protocol that addresses inconsistent split practices in prior EEG research. Finally, we develop a statistical reporting framework tailored for low-trial EEG settings. Our work provides a reproducible and open-source foundation for subject-agnostic EEG decoding in real-world BCI systems.</description>

      <title>ScriptViT: Vision Transformer-Based Personalized Handwriting Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Styled handwriting generation aims to synthesize handwritten text that looks both realistic and aligned with a specific writer's style. While recent approaches involving GAN, transformer and diffusion-based models have made progress, they often struggle to capture the full spectrum of writer-specific attributes, particularly global stylistic patterns that span long-range spatial dependencies. As a result, capturing subtle writer-specific traits such as consistent slant, curvature or stroke pressure, while keeping the generated text accurate is still an open problem. In this work, we present a unified framework designed to address these limitations. We introduce a Vision Transformer-based style encoder that learns global stylistic patterns from multiple reference images, allowing the model to better represent long-range structural characteristics of handwriting. We then integrate these style cues with the target text using a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the system to produce handwritten images that more faithfully reflect the intended style. To make the process more interpretable, we utilize Salient Stroke Attention Analysis (SSAA), which reveals the stroke-level features the model focuses on during style transfer. Together, these components lead to handwriting synthesis that is not only more stylistically coherent, but also easier to understand and analyze.</description>

      <title>AnyExperts: On-Demand Expert Allocation for Multimodal Language Models with Mixture of Expert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models offer a promising path toward scalable and efficient large vision-language systems. However, existing approaches rely on rigid routing strategies (typically activating a fixed number of experts per token) ignoring the inherent heterogeneity in semantic importance across modalities. This leads to suboptimal compute allocation, where redundant tokens consume as many resources as critical ones. To address this, we propose AnyExperts, a novel on-demand, budget-aware dynamic routing framework that allocates a variable total number of expert slots per token based on its semantic importance. Crucially, to prevent uncontrolled compute growth, the total slots per token are constrained within a fixed range, and each slot is filled by either a real expert or a virtual expert, with the virtual share capped at a small maximum (e.g., 20%). The model then adaptively balances the real-to-virtual ratio per token, assigning more real experts to semantically rich regions and relying more on virtual experts for redundant content. Evaluated across diverse tasks in visual understanding, audio understanding, and NLP understanding, AnyExperts improves performance under the same compute budget. Notably, on general image/video tasks, it achieves comparable accuracy with 40% fewer real expert activations; on text-dense tasks (OCR and NLP), it maintains performance while reducing real expert usage by 10%. These results demonstrate that fine-grained, importance-driven expert allocation significantly enhances both the efficiency and effectiveness of multimodal MoE models.</description>

      <title>General vs Domain-Specific CNNs: Understanding Pretraining Effects on Brain MRI Tumor Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain tumor detection from MRI scans plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in medical imaging tasks, particularly when pretrained on large datasets. However, it remains unclear which type of pretrained model performs better when only a small dataset is available: those trained on domain-specific medical data or those pretrained on large general datasets. In this study, we systematically evaluate three pretrained CNN architectures for brain tumor classification: RadImageNet DenseNet121 with medical-domain pretraining, EfficientNetV2S, and ConvNeXt-Tiny, which are modern general-purpose CNNs. All models were trained and fine-tuned under identical conditions using a limited-size brain MRI dataset to ensure a fair comparison. Our results reveal that ConvNeXt-Tiny achieved the highest accuracy, followed by EfficientNetV2S, while RadImageNet DenseNet121, despite being pretrained on domain-specific medical data, exhibited poor generalization with lower accuracy and higher loss. These findings suggest that domain-specific pretraining may not generalize well under small-data conditions. In contrast, modern, deeper general-purpose CNNs pretrained on large-scale datasets can offer superior transfer learning performance in specialized medical imaging tasks.</description>

      <title>Clinician-in-the-Loop Smart Home System to Detect Urinary Tract Infection Flare-Ups via Uncertainty-Aware Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urinary tract infection (UTI) flare-ups pose a significant health risk for older adults with chronic conditions. These infections often go unnoticed until they become severe, making early detection through innovative smart home technologies crucial. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches relying on simple binary classification for UTI detection offer limited utility to nurses and practitioners as they lack insight into prediction uncertainty, hindering informed clinical decision-making. This paper presents a clinician-in-the-loop (CIL) smart home system that leverages ambient sensor data to extract meaningful behavioral markers, train robust predictive ML models, and calibrate them to enable uncertainty-aware decision support. The system incorporates a statistically valid uncertainty quantification method called Conformal-Calibrated Interval (CCI), which quantifies uncertainty and abstains from making predictions ("I don't know") when the ML model's confidence is low. Evaluated on real-world data from eight smart homes, our method outperforms baseline methods in recall and other classification metrics while maintaining the lowest abstention proportion and interval width. A survey of 42 nurses confirms that our system's outputs are valuable for guiding clinical decision-making, underscoring their practical utility in improving informed decisions and effectively managing UTIs and other condition flare-ups in older adults.</description>

      <title>OmniStruct: Universal Text-to-Structure Generation across Diverse Schemas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate structured outputs that follow arbitrary schemas is crucial to a wide range of downstream tasks that require diverse structured representations of results such as information extraction, table generation, and function calling. While modern LLMs excel in generating unstructured responses in natural language, whether this advancement translates to a strong performance on text-to-structure tasks remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first introduce OmniStruct, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' capabilities on diverse text-to-structure tasks such as information extraction, table generation, and function calling. We build OmniStruct by identifying existing datasets across a wide range of tasks that are suitable for a structured answer format, and adapting them under a unified text-to-structure problem setting. To facilitate the development of efficient text-to-structure models, we collect high-quality training data via synthetic task generation. Without using any supervised data for OmniStruct tasks, our experiments demonstrate the possibility of fine-tuning much smaller models on synthetic data into universal structured generation models that can rival the performance of GPT-4o.</description>

      <title>Toward an AI-Native Internet: Rethinking the Web Architecture for Semantic Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of Generative AI Search is fundamentally transforming how users and intelligent systems interact with the Internet. LLMs increasingly act as intermediaries between humans and web information. Yet the web remains optimized for human browsing rather than AI-driven semantic retrieval, resulting in wasted network bandwidth, lower information quality, and unnecessary complexity for developers. We introduce the concept of an AI-Native Internet, a web architecture in which servers expose semantically relevant information chunks rather than full documents, supported by a Web-native semantic resolver that allows AI applications to discover relevant information sources before retrieving fine-grained chunks. Through motivational experiments, we quantify the inefficiencies of current HTML-based retrieval, and outline architectural directions and open challenges for evolving today's document-centric web into an AI-oriented substrate that better supports semantic access to web content.</description>

      <title>NSTR: Neural Spectral Transport Representation for Space-Varying Frequency Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for representing signals such as images, audio, and 3D scenes. However, existing INR frameworks -- including MLPs with Fourier features, SIREN, and multiresolution hash grids -- implicitly assume a \textit{global and stationary} spectral basis. This assumption is fundamentally misaligned with real-world signals whose frequency characteristics vary significantly across space, exhibiting local high-frequency textures, smooth regions, and frequency drift phenomena. We propose \textbf{Neural Spectral Transport Representation (NSTR)}, the first INR framework that \textbf{explicitly models a spatially varying local frequency field}. NSTR introduces a learnable \emph{frequency transport equation}, a PDE that governs how local spectral compositions evolve across space. Given a learnable local spectrum field $S(x)$ and a frequency transport network $F_\theta$ enforcing $\nabla S(x) \approx F_\theta(x, S(x))$, NSTR reconstructs signals by spatially modulating a compact set of global sinusoidal bases. This formulation enables strong local adaptivity and offers a new level of interpretability via visualizing frequency flows. Experiments on 2D image regression, audio reconstruction, and implicit 3D geometry show that NSTR achieves significantly better accuracy-parameter trade-offs than SIREN, Fourier-feature MLPs, and Instant-NGP. NSTR requires fewer global frequencies, converges faster, and naturally explains signal structure through spectral transport fields. We believe NSTR opens a new direction in INR research by introducing explicit modeling of space-varying spectrum.</description>

      <title>Can a Second-View Image Be a Language? Geometric and Semantic Cross-Modal Reasoning for X-ray Prohibited Item Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic X-ray prohibited items detection is vital for security inspection and has been widely studied. Traditional methods rely on visual modality, often struggling with complex threats. While recent studies incorporate language to guide single-view images, human inspectors typically use dual-view images in practice. This raises the question: can the second view provide constraints similar to a language modality? In this work, we introduce DualXrayBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for X-ray inspection that includes multiple views and modalities. It supports eight tasks designed to test cross-view reasoning. In DualXrayBench, we introduce a caption corpus consisting of 45,613 dual-view image pairs across 12 categories with corresponding captions. Building upon these data, we propose the Geometric (cross-view)-Semantic (cross-modality) Reasoner (GSR), a multimodal model that jointly learns correspondences between cross-view geometry and cross-modal semantics, treating the second-view images as a "language-like modality". To enable this, we construct the GSXray dataset, with structured Chain-of-Thought sequences: &lt;top&gt;, &lt;side&gt;, &lt;conclusion&gt;. Comprehensive evaluations on DualXrayBench demonstrate that GSR achieves significant improvements across all X-ray tasks, offering a new perspective for real-world X-ray inspection.</description>

      <title>Pre-training Graph Neural Networks on 2D and 3D Molecular Structures by using Multi-View Conditional Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent pre-training strategies for molecular graphs have attempted to use 2D and 3D molecular views as both inputs and self-supervised signals, primarily aligning graph-level representations. However, existing studies remain limited in addressing two main challenges of multi-view molecular learning: (1) discovering shared information between two views while diminishing view-specific information and (2) identifying and aligning important substructures, e.g., functional groups, which are crucial for enhancing cross-view consistency and model expressiveness. To solve these challenges, we propose a Multi-View Conditional Information Bottleneck framework, called MVCIB, for pre-training graph neural networks on 2D and 3D molecular structures in a self-supervised setting. Our idea is to discover the shared information while minimizing irrelevant features from each view under the MVCIB principle, which uses one view as a contextual condition to guide the representation learning of its counterpart. To enhance semantic and structural consistency across views, we utilize key substructures, e.g., functional groups and ego-networks, as anchors between the two views. Then, we propose a cross-attention mechanism that captures fine-grained correlations between the substructures to achieve subgraph alignment across views. Extensive experiments in four molecular domains demonstrated that MVCIB consistently outperforms baselines in both predictive performance and interpretability. Moreover, MVCIB achieved the 3d Weisfeiler-Lehman expressiveness power to distinguish not only non-isomorphic graphs but also different 3D geometries that share identical 2D connectivity, such as isomers.</description>

      <title>Findings of the BlackboxNLP 2025 Shared Task: Localizing Circuits and Causal Variables in Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability (MI) seeks to uncover how language models (LMs) implement specific behaviors, yet measuring progress in MI remains challenging. The recently released Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB; Mueller et al., 2025) provides a standardized framework for evaluating circuit and causal variable localization. Building on this foundation, the BlackboxNLP 2025 Shared Task extends MIB into a community-wide reproducible comparison of MI techniques. The shared task features two tracks: circuit localization, which assesses methods that identify causally influential components and interactions driving model behavior, and causal variable localization, which evaluates approaches that map activations into interpretable features. With three teams spanning eight different methods, participants achieved notable gains in circuit localization using ensemble and regularization strategies for circuit discovery. With one team spanning two methods, participants achieved significant gains in causal variable localization using low-dimensional and non-linear projections to featurize activation vectors. The MIB leaderboard remains open; we encourage continued work in this standard evaluation framework to measure progress in MI research going forward.</description>

Abstract: Although the community has tackled the acquisition of high-quality Arabic pretraining data, we still lack large-scale, multi-turn Arabic datasets that include reasoning and tool calling. Naive translation can work at the pretraining scale, but post-training demands much higher quality, which requires a stricter approach to dataset curation. In this work, we introduce SmolKalam, a translation of Smoltalk2 that uses a multi-model ensemble translation pipeline, applies quality filtering, and examines effective translation techniques for traditional decoder-only models through ablations.</description>

      <title>Categorical Equivariant Deep Learning: Category-Equivariant Neural Networks and Universal Approximation Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of category-equivariant neural networks (CENNs) that unifies group/groupoid-equivariant networks, poset/lattice-equivariant networks, graph and sheaf neural networks. Equivariance is formulated as naturality in a topological category with Radon measures, formulating linear and nonlinear layers in the categorical setup. We prove the equivariant universal approximation theorem in the general setting: the class of finite-depth CENNs is dense in the space of continuous equivariant transformations. We instantiate the framework for groups/groupoids, posets/lattices, graphs and cellular sheaves, deriving universal approximation theorems for them in a systematic manner. Categorical equivariant deep learning thus allows us to expand the horizons of equivariant deep learning beyond group actions, encompassing not only geometric symmetries but also contextual and compositional symmetries.</description>

      <title>General Agentic Memory Via Deep Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory is critical for AI agents, yet the widely-adopted static memory, aiming to create readily available memory in advance, is inevitably subject to severe information loss. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework called \textbf{general agentic memory (GAM)}. GAM follows the principle of "\textbf{just-in time (JIT) compilation}" where it focuses on creating optimized contexts for its client at runtime while keeping only simple but useful memory during the offline stage. To this end, GAM employs a duo-design with the following components. 1) \textbf{Memorizer}, which highlights key historical information using a lightweight memory, while maintaining complete historical information within a universal page-store. 2) \textbf{Researcher}, which retrieves and integrates useful information from the page-store for its online request guided by the pre-constructed memory. This design allows GAM to effectively leverage the agentic capabilities and test-time scalability of frontier large language models (LLMs), while also facilitating end-to-end performance optimization through reinforcement learning. In our experimental study, we demonstrate that GAM achieves substantial improvement on various memory-grounded task completion scenarios against existing memory systems.</description>

      <title>DocPTBench: Benchmarking End-to-End Photographed Document Parsing and Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked the potential for end-to-end document parsing and translation. However, prevailing benchmarks such as OmniDocBench and DITrans are dominated by pristine scanned or digital-born documents, and thus fail to adequately represent the intricate challenges of real-world capture conditions, such as geometric distortions and photometric variations. To fill this gap, we introduce DocPTBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for Photographed Document Parsing and Translation. DocPTBench comprises over 1,300 high-resolution photographed documents from multiple domains, includes eight translation scenarios, and provides meticulously human-verified annotations for both parsing and translation. Our experiments demonstrate that transitioning from digital-born to photographed documents results in a substantial performance decline: popular MLLMs exhibit an average accuracy drop of 18% in end-to-end parsing and 12% in translation, while specialized document parsing models show significant average decrease of 25%. This substantial performance gap underscores the unique challenges posed by documents captured in real-world conditions and reveals the limited robustness of existing models. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Topdu/DocPTBench.</description>

      <title>RegDeepLab: A Two-Stage Decoupled Framework for Interpretable Embryo Fragmentation Grading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The degree of embryo fragmentation serves as a critical morphological indicator for assessing embryo developmental potential in In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) clinical decision-making. However, current manual grading processes are not only time-consuming but also limited by significant inter-observer variability and efficiency bottlenecks. Although deep learning has demonstrated potential in automated grading in recent years, existing solutions face a significant challenge: pure regression models lack the visual explainability required for clinical practice, while pure segmentation models struggle to directly translate pixel-level masks into precise clinical grades. This study proposes RegDeepLab, a dual-branch Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework that integrates State-of-the-Art (SOTA) semantic segmentation (DeepLabV3+) with a multi-scale regression head. Addressing the common issues of "Gradient Conflict" and "Negative Transfer" in multi-task training, we propose a "Two-Stage Decoupled Training Strategy." Experimental results demonstrate that while standard end-to-end MTL training can minimize grading error (MAE=0.046) through our designed "Feature Injection" mechanism, it compromises the integrity of segmentation boundaries. In contrast, our decoupled strategy successfully provides robust and high-precision grading predictions while preserving SOTA-level segmentation accuracy (Dice=0.729). Furthermore, we introduce a "Range Loss" to effectively utilize large-scale discrete grading data for semi-supervised learning. This study ultimately presents a dual-module clinical auxiliary solution that combines high accuracy with visual explainability.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven multi-agent systems has significantly streamlined software developing tasks, enabling users with little technical expertise to develop executable applications. While these systems democratize software creation through natural language requirements, they introduce significant security risks that remain largely unexplored. We identify two risky scenarios: Malicious User with Benign Agents (MU-BA) and Benign User with Malicious Agents (BU-MA). We introduce the Implicit Malicious Behavior Injection Attack (IMBIA), demonstrating how multi-agent systems can be manipulated to generate software with concealed malicious capabilities beneath seemingly benign applications, and propose Adv-IMBIA as a defense mechanism. Evaluations across ChatDev, MetaGPT, and AgentVerse frameworks reveal varying vulnerability patterns, with IMBIA achieving attack success rates of 93%, 45%, and 71% in MU-BA scenarios, and 71%, 84%, and 45% in BU-MA scenarios. Our defense mechanism reduced attack success rates significantly, particularly in the MU-BA scenario. Further analysis reveals that compromised agents in the coding and testing phases pose significantly greater security risks, while also identifying critical agents that require protection against malicious user exploitation. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust security measures in multi-agent software development systems and provide practical guidelines for implementing targeted, resource-efficient defensive strategies.</description>

      <title>InstructAudio: Unified speech and music generation with natural language instruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) and text-to-music (TTM) models face significant limitations in instruction-based control. TTS systems usually depend on reference audio for timbre, offer only limited text-level attribute control, and rarely support dialogue generation. TTM systems are constrained by input conditioning requirements that depend on expert knowledge annotations. The high heterogeneity of these input control conditions makes them difficult to joint modeling with speech synthesis. Despite sharing common acoustic modeling characteristics, these two tasks have long been developed independently, leaving open the challenge of achieving unified modeling through natural language instructions. We introduce InstructAudio, a unified framework that enables instruction-based (natural language descriptions) control of acoustic attributes including timbre (gender, age), paralinguistic (emotion, style, accent), and musical (genre, instrument, rhythm, atmosphere). It supports expressive speech, music, and dialogue generation in English and Chinese. The model employs joint and single diffusion transformer layers with a standardized instruction-phoneme input format, trained on 50K hours of speech and 20K hours of music data, enabling multi-task learning and cross-modal alignment. Fig. 1 visualizes performance comparisons with mainstream TTS and TTM models, demonstrating that InstructAudio achieves optimal results on most metrics. To our best knowledge, InstructAudio represents the first instruction-controlled framework unifying speech and music generation.

      <title>Evaluating perturbation robustnessof generative systems that use COBOL code inputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems incorporating large language models (LLMs) as a component are known to be sensitive (i.e., non-robust) to minor input variations that do not change the meaning of the input; such sensitivity may reduce the system's usefulness. Here, we present a framework to evaluate robustness of systems using COBOL code as input; our application is translation between COBOL and Java programming languages, but the approach extends to other tasks such as code generation or explanation. Targeting robustness of systems with COBOL as input is essential yet challenging. Many business-critical applications are written in COBOL, yet these are typically proprietary legacy applications and their code is unavailable to LLMs for training. We develop a library of COBOL paragraph and full-program perturbation methods, and create variant-expanded versions of a benchmark dataset of examples for a specific task. The robustness of the LLM-based system is evaluated by measuring changes in values of individual and aggregate metrics calculated on the system's outputs. Finally, we present a series of dynamic table and chart visualization dashboards that assist in debugging the system's outputs, and monitoring and understanding root causes of the system's sensitivity to input variation. These tools can be further used to improve the system by, for instance, indicating variations that should be handled by pre-processing steps.</description>

      <title>MindEval: Benchmarking Language Models on Multi-turn Mental Health Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Demand for mental health support through AI chatbots is surging, though current systems present several limitations, like sycophancy or overvalidation, and reinforcement of maladaptive beliefs. A core obstacle to the creation of better systems is the scarcity of benchmarks that capture the complexity of real therapeutic interactions. Most existing benchmarks either only test clinical knowledge through multiple-choice questions or assess single responses in isolation. To bridge this gap, we present MindEval, a framework designed in collaboration with Ph.D-level Licensed Clinical Psychologists for automatically evaluating language models in realistic, multi-turn mental health therapy conversations. Through patient simulation and automatic evaluation with LLMs, our framework balances resistance to gaming with reproducibility via its fully automated, model-agnostic design. We begin by quantitatively validating the realism of our simulated patients against human-generated text and by demonstrating strong correlations between automatic and human expert judgments. Then, we evaluate 12 state-of-the-art LLMs and show that all models struggle, scoring below 4 out of 6, on average, with particular weaknesses in problematic AI-specific patterns of communication. Notably, reasoning capabilities and model scale do not guarantee better performance, and systems deteriorate with longer interactions or when supporting patients with severe symptoms. We release all code, prompts, and human evaluation data.</description>

      <title>Shape-Adapting Gated Experts: Dynamic Expert Routing for Colonoscopic Lesion Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The substantial diversity in cell scale and form remains a primary challenge in computer-aided cancer detection on gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs), attributable to cellular heterogeneity. Existing CNN-Transformer hybrids rely on static computation graphs with fixed routing, which consequently causes redundant computation and limits their adaptability to input variability. We propose Shape-Adapting Gated Experts (SAGE), an input-adaptive framework that enables dynamic expert routing in heterogeneous visual networks. SAGE reconfigures static backbones into dynamically routed expert architectures. SAGE's dual-path design features a backbone stream that preserves representation and selectively activates an expert path through hierarchical gating. This gating mechanism operates at multiple hierarchical levels, performing a two-level, hierarchical selection between shared and specialized experts to modulate model logits for Top-K activation. Our Shape-Adapting Hub (SA-Hub) harmonizes structural and semantic representations across the CNN and the Transformer module, effectively bridging diverse modules. Embodied as SAGE-UNet, our model achieves superior segmentation on three medical benchmarks: EBHI, DigestPath, and GlaS, yielding state-of-the-art Dice Scores of 95.57%, 95.16%, and 94.17%, respectively, and robustly generalizes across domains by adaptively balancing local refinement and global context. SAGE provides a scalable foundation for dynamic expert routing, enabling flexible visual reasoning.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Continual Learning with MLLMs from Multi-scenario Perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning in visual understanding aims to deal with catastrophic forgetting in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MLLMs deployed on devices have to continuously adapt to dynamic scenarios in downstream tasks, such as variations in background and perspective, to effectively perform complex visual tasks. To this end, we construct a multimodal visual understanding dataset (MSVQA) encompassing four different scenarios and perspectives including high altitude, underwater, low altitude and indoor, to investigate the catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs under the dynamics of scenario shifts in real-world data streams. Furthermore, we propose mUltimodal coNtInual learning with MLLMs From multi-scenarIo pERspectives (UNIFIER) to address visual discrepancies while learning different scenarios. Specifically, it decouples the visual information from different scenarios into distinct branches within each vision block and projects them into the same feature space. A consistency constraint is imposed on the features of each branch to maintain the stability of visual representations across scenarios. Extensive experiments on the MSVQA dataset demonstrate that UNIFIER effectively alleviates forgetting of cross-scenario tasks and achieves knowledge accumulation within the same scenario.</description>

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting is central to trading, portfolio optimization, and risk management, yet it remains challenging due to noisy, non-stationary, and heterogeneous data. Recent advances in time series foundation models (TSFMs), inspired by large language models, offer a new paradigm for learning generalizable temporal representations from large and diverse datasets. This paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study of TSFMs in global financial markets. Using a large-scale dataset of daily excess returns across diverse markets, we evaluate zero-shot inference, fine-tuning, and pre-training from scratch against strong benchmark models. We find that off-the-shelf pre-trained TSFMs perform poorly in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, whereas models pre-trained from scratch on financial data achieve substantial forecasting and economic improvements, underscoring the value of domain-specific adaptation. Increasing the dataset size, incorporating synthetic data augmentation, and applying hyperparameter tuning further enhance performance.</description>

      <title>Barriers to AI Adoption: Image Concerns at Work</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concerns about how workers are perceived can deter effective collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI). In a field experiment on a large online labor market, I hired 450 U.S.-based remote workers to complete an image-categorization job assisted by AI recommendations. Workers were incentivized by the prospect of a contract extension based on an HR evaluator's feedback. I find that workers adopt AI recommendations at lower rates when their reliance on AI is visible to the evaluator, resulting in a measurable decline in task performance. The effects are present despite a conservative design in which workers know that the evaluator is explicitly instructed to assess expected accuracy on the same AI-assisted task. This reduction in AI reliance persists even when the evaluator is reassured about workers' strong performance history on the platform, underscoring how difficult these concerns are to alleviate. Leveraging the platform's public feedback feature, I introduce a novel incentive-compatible elicitation method showing that workers fear heavy reliance on AI signals a lack of confidence in their own judgment, a trait they view as essential when collaborating with AI.</description>

Abstract: Organizations are rapidly adopting Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform their operations, yet they lack clear guidance on key decisions for adoption and implementation. While LLMs offer powerful capabilities in content generation, assisted coding, and process automation, businesses face critical challenges in data security, LLM solution development approach, infrastructure requirements, and deployment strategies. Healthcare providers must protect patient data while leveraging LLMs for medical analysis, financial institutions need to balance automated customer service with regulatory compliance, and software companies seek to enhance development productivity while maintaining code security.
  This article presents a systematic six-step decision framework for LLM adoption, helping organizations navigate from initial application selection to final deployment. Based on extensive interviews and analysis of successful and failed implementations, our framework provides practical guidance for business leaders to align technological capabilities with business objectives. Through key decision points and real-world examples from both B2B and B2C contexts, organizations can make informed decisions about LLM adoption while ensuring secure and efficient integration across various use cases, from customer service automation to content creation and advanced analytics.</description>

      <title>Stage-Specific Benchmarking of Deep Learning Models for Glioblastoma Follow-Up MRI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentiating true tumor progression (TP) from treatment-related pseudoprogression (PsP) in glioblastoma remains challenging, especially at early follow-up. We present the first stage-specific, cross-sectional benchmarking of deep learning models for follow-up MRI using the Burdenko GBM Progression cohort (n = 180). We analyze different post-RT scans independently to test whether architecture performance depends on time-point. Eleven representative DL families (CNNs, LSTMs, hybrids, transformers, and selective state-space models) were trained under a unified, QC-driven pipeline with patient-level cross-validation. Across both stages, accuracies were comparable (~0.70-0.74), but discrimination improved at the second follow-up, with F1 and AUC increasing for several models, indicating richer separability later in the care pathway. A Mamba+CNN hybrid consistently offered the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, while transformer variants delivered competitive AUCs at substantially higher computational cost and lightweight CNNs were efficient but less reliable. Performance also showed sensitivity to batch size, underscoring the need for standardized training protocols. Notably, absolute discrimination remained modest overall, reflecting the intrinsic difficulty of TP vs. PsP and the dataset's size imbalance. These results establish a stage-aware benchmark and motivate future work incorporating longitudinal modeling, multi-sequence MRI, and larger multi-center cohorts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study informs the design of future multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) and multi-robot motion planning (MRMP) algorithms by guiding choices based on constraint classification for constraint-based search algorithms. We categorize constraints as conservative or aggressive and provide insights into their search behavior, focusing specifically on vanilla Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Conflict-Based Search with Priorities (CBSw/P). Under a hybrid grid-roadmap representation with varying resolution, we observe that aggressive (priority constraint) formulations tend to solve more instances as agent count or resolution increases, whereas conservative (motion constraint) formulations yield stronger solution quality when both succeed. Findings are synthesized in a decision flowchart, aiding users in selecting suitable constraints. Recommendations extend to Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP), emphasizing the importance of considering topological features alongside problem, solution, and representation features. A comprehensive exploration of the study, including raw data and map performance, is available in our public GitHub Repository: https://GitHub.com/hannahjmlee/constraint-mapf-analysis</description>

      <title>KAN vs LSTM Performance in Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper compares Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) for forecasting non-deterministic stock price data, evaluating predictive accuracy versus interpretability trade-offs using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).LSTM demonstrates substantial superiority across all tested prediction horizons, confirming their established effectiveness for sequential data modelling. Standard KAN, while offering theoretical interpretability through the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, exhibits significantly higher error rates and limited practical applicability for time series forecasting. The results confirm LSTM dominance in accuracy-critical time series applications while identifying computational efficiency as KANs' primary advantage in resource-constrained scenarios where accuracy requirements are less stringent. The findings support LSTM adoption for practical financial forecasting while suggesting that continued research into specialised KAN architectures may yield future improvements.</description>

      <title>A Unified BERT-CNN-BiLSTM Framework for Simultaneous Headline Classification and Sentiment Analysis of Bangla News</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our daily lives, newspapers are an essential information source that impacts how the public talks about present-day issues. However, effectively navigating the vast amount of news content from different newspapers and online news portals can be challenging. Newspaper headlines with sentiment analysis tell us what the news is about (e.g., politics, sports) and how the news makes us feel (positive, negative, neutral). This helps us quickly understand the emotional tone of the news. This research presents a state-of-the-art approach to Bangla news headline classification combined with sentiment analysis applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly the hybrid transfer learning model BERT-CNN-BiLSTM. We have explored a dataset called BAN-ABSA of 9014 news headlines, which is the first time that has been experimented with simultaneously in the headline and sentiment categorization in Bengali newspapers. Over this imbalanced dataset, we applied two experimental strategies: technique-1, where undersampling and oversampling are applied before splitting, and technique-2, where undersampling and oversampling are applied after splitting on the In technique-1 oversampling provided the strongest performance, both headline and sentiment, that is 78.57\% and 73.43\% respectively, while technique-2 delivered the highest result when trained directly on the original imbalanced dataset, both headline and sentiment, that is 81.37\% and 64.46\% respectively. The proposed model BERT-CNN-BiLSTM significantly outperforms all baseline models in classification tasks, and achieves new state-of-the-art results for Bangla news headline classification and sentiment analysis. These results demonstrate the importance of leveraging both the headline and sentiment datasets, and provide a strong baseline for Bangla text classification in low-resource.</description>

      <title>OpenGloss: A Synthetic Encyclopedic Dictionary and Semantic Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present OpenGloss, a synthetic encyclopedic dictionary and semantic knowledge graph for English that integrates lexicographic definitions, encyclopedic context, etymological histories, and semantic relationships in a unified resource. OpenGloss contains 537K senses across 150K lexemes, on par with WordNet 3.1 and Open English WordNet, while providing more than four times as many sense definitions. These lexemes include 9.1M semantic edges, 1M usage examples, 3M collocations, and 60M words of encyclopedic content.
  Generated through a multi-agent procedural generation pipeline with schema-validated LLM outputs and automated quality assurance, the entire resource was produced in under one week for under $1,000. This demonstrates that structured generation can create comprehensive lexical resources at cost and time scales impractical for manual curation, enabling rapid iteration as foundation models improve. The resource addresses gaps in pedagogical applications by providing integrated content -- definitions, examples, collocations, encyclopedias, etymology -- that supports both vocabulary learning and natural language processing tasks.
  As a synthetically generated resource, OpenGloss reflects both the capabilities and limitations of current foundation models. The dataset is publicly available on Hugging Face under CC-BY 4.0, enabling researchers and educators to build upon and adapt this resource.</description>

      <title>Majority of the Bests: Improving Best-of-N via Bootstrapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling multiple outputs from a Large Language Model (LLM) and selecting the most frequent (Self-consistency) or highest-scoring (Best-of-N) candidate is a popular approach to achieve higher accuracy in tasks with discrete final answers. Best-of-N (BoN) selects the output with the highest reward, and with perfect rewards, it often achieves near-perfect accuracy. With imperfect rewards from reward models, however, BoN fails to reliably find the correct answer and its performance degrades drastically. We consider the distribution of BoN's outputs and highlight that, although the correct answer does not usually have a probability close to one under imperfect rewards, it is often the most likely outcome. This suggests that the mode of this distribution can be more reliably correct than a sample from it. Based on this idea, we propose Majority-of-the-Bests (MoB), a novel selection mechanism that estimates the output distribution of BoN via bootstrapping and selects its mode. Experimental results across five benchmarks, three different base LLMs, and two reward models demonstrate consistent improvements over BoN in 25 out of 30 setups. We also provide theoretical results for the consistency of the bootstrapping. MoB serves as a simple, yet strong alternative to BoN and self-consistency, and more broadly, motivates further research in more nuanced selection mechanisms.</description>

      <title>No Free Lunch in Language Model Bias Mitigation? Targeted Bias Reduction Can Exacerbate Unmitigated LLM Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit societal biases from their training data, potentially leading to harmful or unfair outputs. While various techniques aim to mitigate these biases, their effects are often evaluated only along the dimension of the bias being targeted. This work investigates the cross-category consequences of targeted bias mitigation. We study four bias mitigation techniques applied across ten models from seven model families, and we explore racial, religious, profession- and gender-related biases. We measure the impact of debiasing on model coherence and stereotypical preference using the StereoSet benchmark. Our results consistently show that while targeted mitigation can sometimes reduce bias in the intended dimension, it frequently leads to unintended and often negative consequences in others, such as increasing model bias and decreasing general coherence. These findings underscore the critical need for robust, multi-dimensional evaluation tools when examining and developing bias mitigation strategies to avoid inadvertently shifting or worsening bias along untargeted axes.</description>

      <title>Health system learning achieves generalist neuroimaging models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as OpenAI's GPT-5 and Meta's DINOv3, have advanced rapidly through training on internet-scale public data, yet such systems lack access to private clinical data. Neuroimaging, in particular, is underrepresented in the public domain due to identifiable facial features within MRI and CT scans, fundamentally restricting model performance in clinical medicine. Here, we show that frontier models underperform on neuroimaging tasks and that learning directly from uncurated data generated during routine clinical care at health systems, a paradigm we call health system learning, yields high-performance, generalist neuroimaging models. We introduce NeuroVFM, a visual foundation model trained on 5.24 million clinical MRI and CT volumes using a scalable volumetric joint-embedding predictive architecture. NeuroVFM learns comprehensive representations of brain anatomy and pathology, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple clinical tasks, including radiologic diagnosis and report generation. The model exhibits emergent neuroanatomic understanding and interpretable visual grounding of diagnostic findings. When paired with open-source language models through lightweight visual instruction tuning, NeuroVFM generates radiology reports that surpass frontier models in accuracy, clinical triage, and expert preference. Through clinically grounded visual understanding, NeuroVFM reduces hallucinated findings and critical errors, offering safer clinical decision support. These results establish health system learning as a paradigm for building generalist medical AI and provide a scalable framework for clinical foundation models.</description>

      <title>Kitty: Accurate and Efficient 2-bit KV Cache Quantization with Dynamic Channel-wise Precision Boost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The KV cache is a dominant memory bottleneck for LLM inference. While 4-bit KV quantization preserves accuracy, 2-bit often degrades it, especially on long-context reasoning. We close this gap via an algorithm-system co-design for mixed-precision KV caching: Kitty. On the algorithm side, extensive experiments show that Dynamic Channel-wise Precision Boost -- which ranks Key-cache channels by sensitivity and keeps only a small fraction at higher precision -- maintains near-zero loss in accuracy drop while approaching 2-bit memory. The main challenge is handling dynamic 4-bit channel boosts while keeping the page layout coalesced and the dequantization uniform, with no scattered reads or hard-coded masks. Kitty addresses these issues by decompose each mixed-precision Key page into two tensors with unified 2-bit precision. Based on this, Kitty provides a page-centric KV layout, Triton-compatible page dequantization kernels, and a lightweight runtime pipeline that preserves coalescing and avoids divergence. Across seven tasks and two model families (Qwen3, LLaMA3), Kitty cuts KV memory by nearly 8x with negligible accuracy loss, enabling up to 8x larger batches and 2.1x-4.1x higher throughput under the same memory budget. We release the full implementation of Kitty at https://github.com/Summer-Summer/Kitty.</description>

      <title>Lean 5.0: A Predictive, Human-AI, and Ethically Grounded Paradigm for Construction Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Lean 5.0, a human-centric evolution of Lean-Digital integration that connects predictive analytics, AI collaboration, and continuous learning within Industry 5.0 and Construction 5.0 contexts. A systematic literature review (2019-2024) and a 12-week empirical validation study demonstrate measurable performance gains, including a 13% increase in Plan Percent Complete (PPC), 22% reduction in rework, and 42% improvement in forecast accuracy. The study adopts a mixed-method Design Science Research (DSR) approach aligned with PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The paper also examines integration with digital twin and blockchain technologies to improve traceability, auditability, and lifecycle transparency. Despite limitations related to sample size, single-case design, and study duration, the findings show that Lean 5.0 provides a transformative paradigm connecting human cognition with predictive control in construction management.</description>

      <title>FHE-Agent: Automating CKKS Configuration for Practical Encrypted Inference via an LLM-Guided Agentic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), particularly the CKKS scheme, is a promising enabler for privacy-preserving MLaaS, but its practical deployment faces a prohibitive barrier: it heavily relies on domain expertise. Configuring CKKS involves a tightly coupled space of ring dimensions, modulus chains, and packing layouts. Without deep cryptographic knowledge to navigate these interactions, practitioners are restricted to compilers that rely on fixed heuristics. These "one-shot" tools often emit rigid configurations that are either severely over-provisioned in latency or fail to find a feasible solution entirely for deeper networks.
  We present FHE-Agent, an agentic framework that automates this expert reasoning process. By coupling a Large Language Model (LLM) controller with a deterministic tool suite, FHE-Agent decomposes the search into global parameter selection and layer-wise bottleneck repair. The agents operate within a multi-fidelity workflow, pruning invalid regimes using cheap static analysis and reserving expensive encrypted evaluations for the most promising candidates.
  We instantiate FHE-Agent on the Orion compiler and evaluate it on standard benchmarks (MLP, LeNet, LoLa) and deeper architectures (AlexNet). FHE-Agent consistently achieves better precision and lower latency than na\"ive search strategies. Crucially, it automatically discovers feasible, 128-bit secure configurations for complex models where baseline heuristics and one-shot prompts fail to produce a valid setup.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Continuous Replacement: Fast and Stable Module Replacement in Pretrained Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Replacing modules in pretrained models, especially swapping quadratic self-attention for efficient attention alternatives, poses a hard optimization problem: cold-start reinitialization destabilizes frozen backbones. We isolate this core stability challenge in a controlled study. Deterministic Continuous Replacement (DCR) blends teacher and student outputs with a deterministic, annealed weight. Theoretically, DCR eliminates gate-induced gradient variance inherent to stochastic replacement. In a single-seed study, DCR attains faster convergence and stronger alignment than stochastic gating and distillation baselines on controlled attention replacement, establishing a foundation for heterogeneous operator swaps.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank GEMM: Efficient Matrix Multiplication via Low-Rank Approximation with FP8 Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large matrix multiplication is a cornerstone of modern machine learning workloads, yet traditional approaches suffer from cubic computational complexity (e.g., $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ for a matrix of size $n\times n$). We present Low-Rank GEMM, a novel approach that leverages low-rank matrix approximations to achieve sub-quadratic complexity while maintaining hardware-accelerated performance through FP8 precision and intelligent kernel selection. On a NVIDIA RTX 4090, our implementation achieves up to 378 TFLOPS on matrices up to $N=20480$, providing 75\% memory savings and $7.8\times$ speedup over PyTorch FP32 for large matrices. The system automatically adapts to hardware capabilities, selecting optimal decomposition methods (SVD, randomized SVD) and precision levels based on matrix characteristics and available accelerators. Comprehensive benchmarking on NVIDIA RTX 4090 demonstrates that Low-Rank GEMM becomes the fastest approach for matrices $N\geq10240$, surpassing traditional cuBLAS implementations through memory bandwidth optimization rather than computational shortcuts.</description>

      <title>MedVision: Dataset and Benchmark for Quantitative Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) in medicine are primarily designed for categorical question answering (e.g., "Is this normal or abnormal?") or qualitative descriptive tasks. However, clinical decision-making often relies on quantitative assessments, such as measuring the size of a tumor or the angle of a joint, from which physicians draw their own diagnostic conclusions. This quantitative reasoning capability remains underexplored and poorly supported in existing VLMs. In this work, we introduce MedVision, a large-scale dataset and benchmark specifically designed to evaluate and improve VLMs on quantitative medical image analysis. MedVision spans 22 public datasets covering diverse anatomies and modalities, with 30.8 million image-annotation pairs. We focus on three representative quantitative tasks: (1) detection of anatomical structures and abnormalities, (2) tumor/lesion (T/L) size estimation, and (3) angle/distance (A/D) measurement. Our benchmarks show that current off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly on these tasks. However, with supervised fine-tuning on MedVision, we significantly enhance their performance across detection, T/L estimation, and A/D measurement, demonstrating reduced error rates and improved precision. This work provides a foundation for developing VLMs with robust quantitative reasoning capabilities in medical imaging. Code and data are available at https://medvision-vlm.github.io.</description>

      <title>VLM in a flash: I/O-Efficient Sparsification of Vision-Language Model via Neuron Chunking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge deployment of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) increasingly relies on flash-based weight offloading, where activation sparsification is used to reduce I/O overhead. However, conventional sparsification remains model-centric, selecting neurons solely by activation magnitude and neglecting how access patterns influence flash performance. We present Neuron Chunking, an I/O-efficient sparsification strategy that operates on chunks (i.e., groups of contiguous neurons in memory) and couples neuron importance with storage access cost. The method models I/O latency through a lightweight abstraction of access contiguity and selects chunks with high utility, defined as neuron importance normalized by estimated latency. By aligning sparsification decisions with the underlying storage behavior, Neuron Chunking improves I/O efficiency by up to 4.65x and 5.76x on Jetson Orin Nano and Jetson AGX Orin, respectively.</description>

      <title>Stable Multi-Drone GNSS Tracking System for Marine Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate localization is essential for marine robotics, yet Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are unreliable or unavailable even at a very short distance below the water surface. Traditional alternatives, such as inertial navigation, Doppler Velocity Loggers (DVL), SLAM, and acoustic methods, suffer from error accumulation, high computational demands, or infrastructure dependence. In this work, we present a scalable multi-drone GNSS-based tracking system for surface and near-surface marine robots. Our approach combines efficient visual detection, lightweight multi-object tracking, GNSS-based triangulation, and a confidence-weighted Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to provide stable GNSS estimation in real time. We further introduce a cross-drone tracking ID alignment algorithm that enforces global consistency across views, enabling robust multi-robot tracking with redundant aerial coverage. We validate our system in diversified complex settings to show the scalability and robustness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

Abstract: This report presents the Empathetic Cascading Networks (ECN) framework, a multi-stage prompting method designed to enhance the empathetic and inclusive capabilities of large language models. ECN employs four stages: Perspective Adoption, Emotional Resonance, Reflective Understanding, and Integrative Synthesis, to guide models toward generating emotionally resonant and contextually aware responses. Experimental results demonstrate that ECN achieves the highest Empathy Quotient (EQ) scores across GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4, while maintaining competitive Regard and Perplexity metrics. These findings emphasize ECN's potential for applications requiring empathy and inclusivity in conversational AI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design, implementation, and evolution of a comprehensive multimodal room-monitoring system that integrates synchronized video and audio processing for real-time activity recognition and anomaly detection. We describe two iterations of the system: an initial lightweight implementation using YOLOv8, ByteTrack, and the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and an advanced version that incorporates multi-model audio ensembles, hybrid object detection, bidirectional cross-modal attention, and multi-method anomaly detection. The evolution demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and industrial applicability. The advanced system combines three audio models (AST, Wav2Vec2, and HuBERT) for comprehensive audio understanding, dual object detectors (YOLO and DETR) for improved accuracy, and sophisticated fusion mechanisms for enhanced cross-modal learning. Experimental evaluation shows the system's effectiveness in general monitoring scenarios as well as specialized industrial safety applications, achieving real-time performance on standard hardware while maintaining high accuracy.</description>

      <title>ObjectAlign: Neuro-Symbolic Object Consistency Verification and Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video editing and synthesis often introduce object inconsistencies, such as frame flicker and identity drift that degrade perceptual quality. To address these issues, we introduce ObjectAlign, a novel framework that seamlessly blends perceptual metrics with symbolic reasoning to detect, verify, and correct object-level and temporal inconsistencies in edited video sequences. The novel contributions of ObjectAlign are as follows: First, we propose learnable thresholds for metrics characterizing object consistency (i.e. CLIP-based semantic similarity, LPIPS perceptual distance, histogram correlation, and SAM-derived object-mask IoU). Second, we introduce a neuro-symbolic verifier that combines two components: (a) a formal, SMT-based check that operates on masked object embeddings to provably guarantee that object identity does not drift, and (b) a temporal fidelity check that uses a probabilistic model checker to verify the video's formal representation against a temporal logic specification. A frame transition is subsequently deemed "consistent" based on a single logical assertion that requires satisfying both the learned metric thresholds and this unified neuro-symbolic constraint, ensuring both low-level stability and high-level temporal correctness. Finally, for each contiguous block of flagged frames, we propose a neural network based interpolation for adaptive frame repair, dynamically choosing the interpolation depth based on the number of frames to be corrected. This enables reconstruction of the corrupted frames from the last valid and next valid keyframes. Our results show up to 1.4 point improvement in CLIP Score and up to 6.1 point improvement in warp error compared to SOTA baselines on the DAVIS and Pexels video datasets.</description>

      <title>Modality-Collaborative Low-Rank Decomposers for Few-Shot Video Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the challenging task of Few-Shot Video Domain Adaptation (FSVDA). The multimodal nature of videos introduces unique challenges, necessitating the simultaneous consideration of both domain alignment and modality collaboration in a few-shot scenario, which is ignored in previous literature. We observe that, under the influence of domain shift, the generalization performance on the target domain of each individual modality, as well as that of fused multimodal features, is constrained. Because each modality is comprised of coupled features with multiple components that exhibit different domain shifts. This variability increases the complexity of domain adaptation, thereby reducing the effectiveness of multimodal feature integration. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework of Modality-Collaborative LowRank Decomposers (MC-LRD) to decompose modality-unique and modality-shared features with different domain shift levels from each modality that are more friendly for domain alignment. The MC-LRD comprises multiple decomposers for each modality and Multimodal Decomposition Routers (MDR). Each decomposer has progressively shared parameters across different modalities. The MDR is leveraged to selectively activate the decomposers to produce modality-unique and modality-shared features. To ensure efficient decomposition, we apply orthogonal decorrelation constraints separately to decomposers and subrouters, enhancing their diversity. Furthermore, we propose a cross-domain activation consistency loss to guarantee that target and source samples of the same category exhibit consistent activation preferences of the decomposers, thereby facilitating domain alignment. Extensive experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements over existing methods.</description>

      <title>AIRHILT: A Human-in-the-Loop Testbed for Multimodal Conflict Detection in Aviation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce AIRHILT (Aviation Integrated Reasoning, Human-in-the-Loop Testbed), a modular and lightweight simulation environment designed to evaluate multimodal pilot and air traffic control (ATC) assistance systems for aviation conflict detection. Built on the open-source Godot engine, AIRHILT synchronizes pilot and ATC radio communications, visual scene understanding from camera streams, and ADS-B surveillance data within a unified, scalable platform. The environment supports pilot- and controller-in-the-loop interactions, providing a comprehensive scenario suite covering both terminal area and en route operational conflicts, including communication errors and procedural mistakes. AIRHILT offers standardized JSON-based interfaces that enable researchers to easily integrate, swap, and evaluate automatic speech recognition (ASR), visual detection, decision-making, and text-to-speech (TTS) models. We demonstrate AIRHILT through a reference pipeline incorporating fine-tuned Whisper ASR, YOLO-based visual detection, ADS-B-based conflict logic, and GPT-OSS-20B structured reasoning, and present preliminary results from representative runway-overlap scenarios, where the assistant achieves an average time-to-first-warning of approximately 7.7 s, with average ASR and vision latencies of approximately 5.9 s and 0.4 s, respectively. The AIRHILT environment and scenario suite are openly available, supporting reproducible research on multimodal situational awareness and conflict detection in aviation; code and scenarios are available at https://github.com/ogarib3/airhilt.</description>

      <title>Yo'City: Personalized and Boundless 3D Realistic City Scene Generation via Self-Critic Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realistic 3D city generation is fundamental to a wide range of applications, including virtual reality and digital twins. However, most existing methods rely on training a single diffusion model, which limits their ability to generate personalized and boundless city-scale scenes. In this paper, we present Yo'City, a novel agentic framework that enables user-customized and infinitely expandable 3D city generation by leveraging the reasoning and compositional capabilities of off-the-shelf large models. Specifically, Yo'City first conceptualize the city through a top-down planning strategy that defines a hierarchical "City-District-Grid" structure. The Global Planner determines the overall layout and potential functional districts, while the Local Designer further refines each district with detailed grid-level descriptions. Subsequently, the grid-level 3D generation is achieved through a "produce-refine-evaluate" isometric image synthesis loop, followed by image-to-3D generation. To simulate continuous city evolution, Yo'City further introduces a user-interactive, relationship-guided expansion mechanism, which performs scene graph-based distance- and semantics-aware layout optimization, ensuring spatially coherent city growth. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a diverse benchmark dataset and design six multi-dimensional metrics that assess generation quality from the perspectives of semantics, geometry, texture, and layout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Yo'City consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation aspects.</description>

      <title>Thinking Ahead: Foresight Intelligence in MLLMs and World Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we define Foresight Intelligence as the capability to anticipate and interpret future events-an ability essential for applications such as autonomous driving, yet largely overlooked by existing research. To bridge this gap, we introduce FSU-QA, a new Visual Question-Answering (VQA) dataset specifically designed to elicit and evaluate Foresight Intelligence. Using FSU-QA, we conduct the first comprehensive study of state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) under foresight-oriented tasks, revealing that current models still struggle to reason about future situations. Beyond serving as a benchmark, FSU-QA also enables the assessment of world models by measuring the semantic coherence of their generated predictions, quantified through performance gains when VLMs are augmented with such outputs. Our experiments further demonstrate that FSU-QA can effectively enhance foresight reasoning: even small VLMs fine-tuned on FSU-QA surpass much larger, advanced models by a substantial margin. Together, these findings position FSU-QA as a principled foundation for developing next-generation models capable of truly anticipating and understanding future events.</description>

      <title>ProxT2I: Efficient Reward-Guided Text-to-Image Generation via Proximal Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a dominant paradigm for generative modeling across a wide range of domains, including prompt-conditional generation. The vast majority of samplers, however, rely on forward discretization of the reverse diffusion process and use score functions that are learned from data. Such forward and explicit discretizations can be slow and unstable, requiring a large number of sampling steps to produce good-quality samples. In this work we develop a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model based on backward discretizations, dubbed ProxT2I, relying on learned and conditional proximal operators instead of score functions. We further leverage recent advances in reinforcement learning and policy optimization to optimize our samplers for task-specific rewards. Additionally, we develop a new large-scale and open-source dataset comprising 15 million high-quality human images with fine-grained captions, called LAION-Face-T2I-15M, for training and evaluation. Our approach consistently enhances sampling efficiency and human-preference alignment compared to score-based baselines, and achieves results on par with existing state-of-the-art and open-source text-to-image models while requiring lower compute and smaller model size, offering a lightweight yet performant solution for human text-to-image generation.</description>

      <title>RhinoInsight: Improving Deep Research through Control Mechanisms for Model Behavior and Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are evolving from single-turn responders into tool-using agents capable of sustained reasoning and decision-making for deep research. Prevailing systems adopt a linear pipeline of plan to search to write to a report, which suffers from error accumulation and context rot due to the lack of explicit control over both model behavior and context. We introduce RhinoInsight, a deep research framework that adds two control mechanisms to enhance robustness, traceability, and overall quality without parameter updates. First, a Verifiable Checklist module transforms user requirements into traceable and verifiable sub-goals, incorporates human or LLM critics for refinement, and compiles a hierarchical outline to anchor subsequent actions and prevent non-executable planning. Second, an Evidence Audit module structures search content, iteratively updates the outline, and prunes noisy context, while a critic ranks and binds high-quality evidence to drafted content to ensure verifiability and reduce hallucinations. Our experiments demonstrate that RhinoInsight achieves state-of-the-art performance on deep research tasks while remaining competitive on deep search tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a \textit{"GPT moment"} in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: \textit{the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions}. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{Primitive Embodied World Models} (PEWM), which restricts video generation to fixed shorter horizons, our approach \textit{1) enables} fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, \textit{2) reduces} learning complexity, \textit{3) improves} data efficiency in embodied data collection, and \textit{4) decreases} inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Multi-View Visual Anomaly Detection via Progressive Homography-Guided Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised visual anomaly detection from multi-view images presents a significant challenge: distinguishing genuine defects from benign appearance variations caused by viewpoint changes. Existing methods, often designed for single-view inputs, treat multiple views as a disconnected set of images, leading to inconsistent feature representations and a high false-positive rate. To address this, we introduce ViewSense-AD (VSAD), a novel framework that learns viewpoint-invariant representations by explicitly modeling geometric consistency across views. At its core is our Multi-View Alignment Module (MVAM), which leverages homography to project and align corresponding feature regions between neighboring views. We integrate MVAM into a View-Align Latent Diffusion Model (VALDM), enabling progressive and multi-stage alignment during the denoising process. This allows the model to build a coherent and holistic understanding of the object's surface from coarse to fine scales. Furthermore, a lightweight Fusion Refiner Module (FRM) enhances the global consistency of the aligned features, suppressing noise and improving discriminative power. Anomaly detection is performed by comparing multi-level features from the diffusion model against a learned memory bank of normal prototypes. Extensive experiments on the challenging RealIAD and MANTA datasets demonstrate that VSAD sets a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in pixel, view, and sample-level visual anomaly proving its robustness to large viewpoint shifts and complex textures.</description>

      <title>Re-Key-Free, Risky-Free: Adaptable Model Usage Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become valuable intellectual property of model owners, due to the substantial resources required for their development. To protect these assets in the deployed environment, recent research has proposed model usage control mechanisms to ensure models cannot be used without proper authorization. These methods typically lock the utility of the model by embedding an access key into its parameters. However, they often assume static deployment, and largely fail to withstand continual post-deployment model updates, such as fine-tuning or task-specific adaptation. In this paper, we propose ADALOC, to endow key-based model usage control with adaptability during model evolution. It strategically selects a subset of weights as an intrinsic access key, which enables all model updates to be confined to this key throughout the evolution lifecycle. ADALOC enables using the access key to restore the keyed model to the latest authorized states without redistributing the entire network (i.e., adaptation), and frees the model owner from full re-keying after each model update (i.e., lock preservation). We establish a formal foundation to underpin ADALOC, providing crucial bounds such as the errors introduced by updates restricted to the access key. Experiments on standard benchmarks, such as CIFAR-100, Caltech-256, and Flowers-102, and modern architectures, including ResNet, DenseNet, and ConvNeXt, demonstrate that ADALOC achieves high accuracy under significant updates while retaining robust protections. Specifically, authorized usages consistently achieve strong task-specific performance, while unauthorized usage accuracy drops to near-random guessing levels (e.g., 1.01% on CIFAR-100), compared to up to 87.01% without ADALOC. This shows that ADALOC can offer a practical solution for adaptive and protected DNN deployment in evolving real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Garment Conditioning in Diffusion-based Virtual Try-On</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual Try-On (VTON) is the task of synthesizing an image of a person wearing a target garment, conditioned on a person image and a garment image. While diffusion-based VTON models featuring a Dual UNet architecture demonstrate superior fidelity compared to single UNet models, they incur substantial computational and memory overhead due to their heavy structure. In this study, through visualization analysis and theoretical analysis, we derived three hypotheses regarding the learning of context features to condition the denoising process. Based on these hypotheses, we developed Re-CatVTON, an efficient single UNet model that achieves high performance. We further enhance the model by introducing a modified classifier-free guidance strategy tailored for VTON's spatial concatenation conditioning, and by directly injecting the ground-truth garment latent derived from the clean garment latent to prevent the accumulation of prediction error. The proposed Re-CatVTON significantly improves performance compared to its predecessor (CatVTON) and requires less computation and memory than the high-performance Dual UNet model, Leffa. Our results demonstrate improved FID, KID, and LPIPS scores, with only a marginal decrease in SSIM, establishing a new efficiency-performance trade-off for single UNet VTON models.</description>

      <title>ConceptGuard: Proactive Safety in Text-and-Image-to-Video Generation through Multimodal Risk Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in video generative models has enabled the creation of high-quality videos from multimodal prompts that combine text and images. While these systems offer enhanced controllability, they also introduce new safety risks, as harmful content can emerge from individual modalities or their interaction. Existing safety methods are often text-only, require prior knowledge of the risk category, or operate as post-generation auditors, struggling to proactively mitigate such compositional, multimodal risks. To address this challenge, we present ConceptGuard, a unified safeguard framework for proactively detecting and mitigating unsafe semantics in multimodal video generation. ConceptGuard operates in two stages: First, a contrastive detection module identifies latent safety risks by projecting fused image-text inputs into a structured concept space; Second, a semantic suppression mechanism steers the generative process away from unsafe concepts by intervening in the prompt's multimodal conditioning. To support the development and rigorous evaluation of this framework, we introduce two novel benchmarks: ConceptRisk, a large-scale dataset for training on multimodal risks, and T2VSafetyBench-TI2V, the first benchmark adapted from T2VSafetyBench for the Text-and-Image-to-Video (TI2V) safety setting. Comprehensive experiments on both benchmarks show that ConceptGuard consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in both risk detection and safe video generation.</description>

Abstract: Streamline classification is essential to identify anatomically meaningful white matter tracts from diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography. However, current streamline classification methods rely primarily on the geometric features of the streamline trajectory, failing to distinguish between functionally distinct fiber tracts with similar pathways. To address this, we introduce a novel dual-stream streamline classification framework that jointly analyzes dMRI and functional MRI (fMRI) data to enhance the functional coherence of tract parcellation. We design a novel network that performs streamline classification using a pretrained backbone model for full streamline trajectories, while augmenting with an auxiliary network that processes fMRI signals from fiber endpoint regions. We demonstrate our method by parcellating the corticospinal tract (CST) into its four somatotopic subdivisions. Experimental results from ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate our approach's superior performance.</description>

      <title>HyperbolicRAG: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Hyperbolic Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to access external knowledge, helping mitigate hallucinations and enhance domain-specific expertise. Graph-based RAG enhances structural reasoning by introducing explicit relational organization that enables information propagation across semantically connected text units. However, these methods typically rely on Euclidean embeddings that capture semantic similarity but lack a geometric notion of hierarchical depth, limiting their ability to represent abstraction relationships inherent in complex knowledge graphs. To capture both fine-grained semantics and global hierarchy, we propose HyperbolicRAG, a retrieval framework that integrates hyperbolic geometry into graph-based RAG. HyperbolicRAG introduces three key designs: (1) a depth-aware representation learner that embeds nodes within a shared Poincare manifold to align semantic similarity with hierarchical containment, (2) an unsupervised contrastive regularization that enforces geometric consistency across abstraction levels, and (3) a mutual-ranking fusion mechanism that jointly exploits retrieval signals from Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, emphasizing cross-space agreement during inference. Extensive experiments across multiple QA benchmarks demonstrate that HyperbolicRAG outperforms competitive baselines, including both standard RAG and graph-augmented baselines.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Long-Tail Bias in HOI Detection via Adaptive Diversity Cache</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, empowering machines to comprehend human-object relationships in diverse real-world scenarios. Recent advances in VLMs have significantly improved HOI detection by leveraging rich cross-modal representations. However, most existing VLM-based approaches rely heavily on additional training or prompt tuning, resulting in substantial computational overhead and limited scalability, particularly in long-tailed scenarios where rare interactions are severely underrepresented. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive Diversity Cache (ADC) module, a novel training-free and plug-and-play mechanism designed to mitigate long-tail bias in HOI detection. ADC constructs class-specific caches that accumulate high-confidence and diverse feature representations during inference. The method incorporates frequency-aware cache adaptation that favors rare categories and is designed to enable robust prediction calibration without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets show that ADC consistently improves existing HOI detectors, achieving up to +8.57\% mAP gain on rare categories and +4.39\% on the full dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating long-tail bias while preserving overall performance.</description>

      <title>Solving a Research Problem in Mathematical Statistics with AI Assistance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last few months, AI models including large language models have improved greatly. There are now several documented examples where they have helped professional mathematical scientists prove new results, sometimes even helping resolve known open problems. In this short note, we add another example to the list, by documenting how we were able to solve a previously unsolved research problem in robust mathematical statistics with crucial help from GPT-5. Our problem concerns robust density estimation, where the observations are perturbed by Wasserstein-bounded contaminations.In a previous preprint (Chao and Dobriban, 2023, arxiv:2308.01853v2), we have obtained upper and lower bounds on the minimax optimal estimation error; which were, however, not sharp.
  Starting in October 2025, making significant use of GPT-5 Pro, we were able to derive the minimax optimal error rate (reported in version 3 of the above arxiv preprint). GPT-5 provided crucial help along the way, including by suggesting calculations that we did not think of, and techniques that were not familiar to us, such as the dynamic Benamou-Brenier formulation, for key steps in the analysis. Working with GPT-5 took a few weeks of effort, and we estimate that it could have taken several months to get the same results otherwise. At the same time, there are still areas where working with GPT-5 was challenging: it sometimes provided incorrect references, and glossed over details that sometimes took days of work to fill in. We outline our workflow and steps taken to mitigate issues. Overall, our work can serve as additional documentation for a new age of human-AI collaborative work in mathematical science.</description>

      <title>FlowSteer: Guiding Few-Step Image Synthesis with Authentic Trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the success of flow matching in visual generation, sampling efficiency remains a critical bottleneck for its practical application. Among flow models' accelerating methods, ReFlow has been somehow overlooked although it has theoretical consistency with flow matching. This is primarily due to its suboptimal performance in practical scenarios compared to consistency distillation and score distillation. In this work, we investigate this issue within the ReFlow framework and propose FlowSteer, a method unlocks the potential of ReFlow-based distillation by guiding the student along teacher's authentic generation trajectories. We first identify that Piecewised ReFlow's performance is hampered by a critical distribution mismatch during the training and propose Online Trajectory Alignment(OTA) to resolve it. Then, we introduce a adversarial distillation objective applied directly on the ODE trajectory, improving the student's adherence to the teacher's generation trajectory. Furthermore, we find and fix a previously undiscovered flaw in the widely-used FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler that largely degrades few-step inference quality. Our experiment result on SD3 demonstrates our method's efficacy.</description>

      <title>Addressing Situated Teaching Needs: A Multi-Agent Framework for Automated Slide Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adaptation of teaching slides to instructors' situated teaching needs, including pedagogical styles and their students' context, is a critical yet time-consuming task for educators. Through a series of educator interviews, we first identify and systematically categorize the key friction points that impede this adaptation process. Grounded in these findings, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework designed to automate slide adaptation based on high-level instructor specifications. An evaluation involving 16 modification requests across 8 real-world courses validates our approach. The framework's output consistently achieved high scores in intent alignment, content coherence and factual accuracy, and performed on par with baseline methods regarding visual clarity, while also demonstrating appropriate timeliness and a high operational agreement with human experts, achieving an F1 score of 0.89. This work heralds a new paradigm where AI agents handle the logistical burdens of instructional design, liberating educators to focus on the creative and strategic aspects of teaching.</description>

      <title>Federated style aware transformer aggregation of representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) faces persistent challenges, including domain heterogeneity from diverse client data, data imbalance due to skewed participation, and strict communication constraints. Traditional federated learning often lacks personalization, as a single global model cannot capture client-specific characteristics, leading to biased predictions and poor generalization, especially for clients with highly divergent data distributions.
  To address these issues, we propose FedSTAR, a style-aware federated learning framework that disentangles client-specific style factors from shared content representations. FedSTAR aggregates class-wise prototypes using a Transformer-based attention mechanism, allowing the server to adaptively weight client contributions while preserving personalization.
  Furthermore, by exchanging compact prototypes and style vectors instead of full model parameters, FedSTAR significantly reduces communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that combining content-style disentanglement with attention-driven prototype aggregation improves personalization and robustness in heterogeneous environments without increasing communication cost.</description>

      <title>Optimizing LLM Code Suggestions: Feedback-Driven Timing with Lightweight State Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed code auto-completion by generating context-aware suggestions. Yet, deciding when to present these suggestions remains underexplored, often leading to interruptions or wasted inference calls. We propose an adaptive timing mechanism that dynamically adjusts the delay before offering a suggestion based on real-time developer feedback. Our suggested method combines a logistic transform of recent acceptance rates with a bounded delay range, anchored by a high-level binary prediction of the developer's cognitive state. In a two-month deployment with professional developers, our system improved suggestion acceptance from 4.9% with no delay to 15.4% with static delays, and to 18.6% with adaptive timing-while reducing blind rejections (rejections without being read) from 8.3% to 0.36%. Together, these improvements increase acceptance and substantially reduce wasted inference calls by 75%, making LLM-based code assistants more efficient and cost-effective in practice.</description>

      <title>WaveTuner: Comprehensive Wavelet Subband Tuning for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the inherent complexity, temporal patterns in real-world time series often evolve across multiple intertwined scales, including long-term periodicity, short-term fluctuations, and abrupt regime shifts. While existing literature has designed many sophisticated decomposition approaches based on the time or frequency domain to partition trend-seasonality components and high-low frequency components, an alternative line of approaches based on the wavelet domain has been proposed to provide a unified multi-resolution representation with precise time-frequency localization. However, most wavelet-based methods suffer from a persistent bias toward recursively decomposing only low-frequency components, severely underutilizing subtle yet informative high-frequency components that are pivotal for precise time series forecasting. To address this problem, we propose WaveTuner, a Wavelet decomposition framework empowered by full-spectrum subband Tuning for time series forecasting. Concretely, WaveTuner comprises two key modules: (i) Adaptive Wavelet Refinement module, that transforms time series into time-frequency coefficients, utilizes an adaptive router to dynamically assign subband weights, and generates subband-specific embeddings to support refinement; and (ii) Multi-Branch Specialization module, that employs multiple functional branches, each instantiated as a flexible Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with a distinct functional order to model a specific spectral subband. Equipped with these modules, WaveTuner comprehensively tunes global trends and local variations within a unified time-frequency framework. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate WaveTuner achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance in time series forecasting.</description>

      <title>Personalized Federated Segmentation with Shared Feature Aggregation and Boundary-Focused Calibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) possesses the unique capability of preserving data confidentiality among clients while tackling the data heterogeneity problem of non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. Its advantages have led to widespread adoption in domains such as medical image segmentation. However, the existing approaches mostly overlook the potential benefits of leveraging shared features across clients, where each client contains segmentation data of different organs. In this work, we introduce a novel personalized federated approach for organ agnostic tumor segmentation (FedOAP), that utilizes cross-attention to model long-range dependencies among the shared features of different clients and a boundary-aware loss to improve segmentation consistency. FedOAP employs a decoupled cross-attention (DCA), which enables each client to retain local queries while attending to globally shared key-value pairs aggregated from all clients, thereby capturing long-range inter-organ feature dependencies. Additionally, we introduce perturbed boundary loss (PBL) which focuses on the inconsistencies of the predicted mask's boundary for each client, forcing the model to localize the margins more precisely. We evaluate FedOAP on diverse tumor segmentation tasks spanning different organs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedOAP consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art federated and personalized segmentation methods.</description>

      <title>Pre-Filtering Code Suggestions using Developer Behavioral Telemetry to Optimize LLM-Assisted Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into code editors to provide AI-powered code suggestions. Yet many of these suggestions are ignored, resulting in wasted computation, increased latency, and unnecessary interruptions. We introduce a lightweight pre-filtering model that predicts the likelihood of suggestion acceptance before invoking the LLM, using only real-time developer telemetry such as typing speed, file navigation, and editing activity. Deployed in a production-grade Visual Studio Code plugin over four months of naturalistic use, our approach nearly doubled acceptance rates (18.4% -&gt; 34.2%) while suppressing 35% of low-value LLM calls. These findings demonstrate that behavioral signals alone can meaningfully improve both user experience and system efficiency in LLM-assisted programming, highlighting the value of timing-aware, privacy-preserving adaptation mechanisms. The filter operates solely on pre-invocation editor telemetry and never inspects code or prompts.</description>

      <title>Time Travel: LLM-Assisted Semantic Behavior Localization with Git Bisect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into the Git bisect process for semantic fault localization. Traditional bisect assumes deterministic predicates and binary failure states assumptions often violated in modern software development due to flaky tests, nonmonotonic regressions, and semantic divergence from upstream repositories. Our system augments bisect traversal with structured chain of thought reasoning, enabling commit by commit analysis under noisy conditions. We evaluate multiple open source and proprietary LLMs for their suitability and fine tune DeepSeekCoderV2 using QLoRA on a curated dataset of semantically labeled diffs. We adopt a weak supervision workflow to reduce annotation overhead, incorporating human in the loop corrections and self consistency filtering. Experiments across multiple open source projects show a 6.4 point absolute gain in success rate from 74.2 to 80.6 percent, leading to significantly fewer failed traversals and by experiment up to 2x reduction in average bisect time. We conclude with discussions on temporal reasoning, prompt design, and finetuning strategies tailored for commit level behavior analysis.</description>

      <title>Deep Hybrid Model for Region of Interest Detection in Omnidirectional Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main goal of the project is to design a new model that predicts regions of interest in 360$^{\circ}$ videos. The region of interest (ROI) plays an important role in 360$^{\circ}$ video streaming. For example, ROIs are used to predict view-ports, intelligently cut the videos for live streaming, etc so that less bandwidth is used. Detecting view-ports in advance helps reduce the movement of the head while streaming and watching a video via the head-mounted device. Whereas, intelligent cuts of the videos help improve the efficiency of streaming the video to users and enhance the quality of their viewing experience. This report illustrates the secondary task to identify ROIs, in which, we design, train, and test a hybrid saliency model. In this work, we refer to saliency regions to represent the regions of interest. The method includes the processes as follows: preprocessing the video to obtain frames, developing a hybrid saliency model for predicting the region of interest, and finally post-processing the output predictions of the hybrid saliency model to obtain the output region of interest for each frame. Then, we compare the performance of the proposed method with the subjective annotations of the 360RAT dataset.</description>

      <title>Generating Reading Comprehension Exercises with Large Language Models for Educational Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), the applications of LLMs have grown substantially. In the education domain, LLMs demonstrate significant potential, particularly in automatic text generation, which enables the creation of intelligent and adaptive learning content. This paper proposes a new LLMs framework, which is named as Reading Comprehension Exercise Generation (RCEG). It can generate high-quality and personalized English reading comprehension exercises automatically. Firstly, RCEG uses fine-tuned LLMs to generate content candidates. Then, it uses a discriminator to select the best candidate. Finally, the quality of the generated content has been improved greatly. To evaluate the performance of RCEG, a dedicated dataset for English reading comprehension is constructed to perform the experiments, and comprehensive evaluation metrics are used to analyze the experimental results. These metrics include content diversity, factual accuracy, linguistic toxicity, and pedagogical alignment. Experimental results show that RCEG significantly improves the relevance and cognitive appropriateness of the generated exercises.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High quality kernels are critical for reducing training and inference costs of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet they traditionally require significant expertise in hardware architecture and software optimization. While recent advances in LLM-based code generation show promise for complex optimization, existing methods struggle with the vast optimization space due to insufficient hardware domain knowledge, failing to effectively balance exploration and exploitation. We present KernelBand, a novel framework that formulates kernel optimization as a hierarchical multi-armed bandit problem, enabling LLM agents to strategically navigate the optimization space by treating kernel selection and optimization strategy application as sequential decision-making processes. Our approach leverages hardware profiling information to identify promising optimization strategies and employs runtime behavior clustering to reduce exploration overhead across kernel candidates. Extensive experiments on TritonBench demonstrate that KernelBand significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance with fewer tokens while exhibiting consistent improvement without saturation as computational resources increase.</description>

Abstract: Evaluating the aesthetic quality of generated songs is challenging due to the multi-dimensional nature of musical perception. We propose a robust music aesthetic evaluation framework that combines (1) multi-source multi-scale feature extraction to obtain complementary segment- and track-level representations, (2) a hierarchical audio augmentation strategy to enrich training data, and (3) a hybrid training objective that integrates regression and ranking losses for accurate scoring and reliable top-song identification. Experiments on the ICASSP 2026 SongEval benchmark demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods across correlation and top-tier metrics.</description>

      <title>Periodic Asynchrony: An Effective Method for Accelerating On-Policy Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the introduction of the GRPO algorithm, reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted increasing attention, with growing efforts to reproduce and apply it. However, training efficiency remains a critical challenge. In mainstream RL frameworks, inference and training are typically deployed on the same devices. While this approach reduces costs through resource consolidation, its synchronous execution imposes a computational coupling that prevents concurrent inference and training. In this study, we are returning to the strategy of separating inference and training deployment, and by introducing improvements in the data loader, we transform the conventional synchronous architecture into a periodically asynchronous framework, which allows for demand-driven, independent, and elastic scaling of each component, while the accuracy of the algorithm remains completely equivalent to the synchronization method, with both belonging to the on-policy strategy. It is worth emphasizing that we apply a unified tri-model architecture in the training phase, and we also proposed a shared-prompt attention mask to reduce repetitive computation. In practice, these works have achieved at least a threefold overall performance improvement in RL training on NPU platforms, indicating its potential for widespread application.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how implicit neural feed back can accelerate reinforcement learning in complex robotic manipulation settings. While prior electroencephalogram (EEG) guided reinforcement learning studies have primarily focused on navigation or low-dimensional locomotion tasks, we aim to understand whether such neural evaluative signals can improve policy learning in high-dimensional manipulation tasks involving obstacles and precise end-effector control. We integrate error related potentials decoded from offline-trained EEG classifiers into reward shaping and systematically evaluate the impact of human-feedback weighting. Experiments on a 7-DoF manipulator in an obstacle-rich reaching environment show that neural feedback accelerates reinforcement learning and, depending on the human-feedback weighting, can yield task success rates that at times exceed those of sparse-reward baselines. Moreover, when applying the best-performing feedback weighting across all sub jects, we observe consistent acceleration of reinforcement learning relative to the sparse-reward setting. Furthermore, leave-one subject-out evaluations confirm that the proposed framework remains robust despite the intrinsic inter-individual variability in EEG decodability. Our findings demonstrate that EEG-based reinforcement learning can scale beyond locomotion tasks and provide a viable pathway for human-aligned manipulation skill acquisition.</description>

      <title>CoreEval: Automatically Building Contamination-Resilient Datasets with Real-World Knowledge toward Reliable LLM Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to the fairness of LLM evaluations in natural language processing tasks by inadvertently exposing models to test data during training. Current studies attempt to mitigate this issue by modifying existing datasets or generating new ones from freshly collected information. However, these methods fall short of ensuring contamination-resilient evaluation, as they fail to fully eliminate pre-existing knowledge from models or preserve the semantic complexity of the original datasets. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{CoreEval}, a \textbf{Co}ntamination-\textbf{re}silient \textbf{Eval}uation strategy for automatically updating data with real-world knowledge. This approach begins by extracting entity relationships from the original data and leveraging the GDELT database to retrieve relevant, up-to-date knowledge. The retrieved knowledge is then recontextualized and integrated with the original data, which is refined and restructured to ensure semantic coherence and enhanced task relevance. Ultimately, a robust data reflection mechanism is employed to iteratively verify and refine labels, ensuring consistency between the updated and original datasets. Extensive experiments on updated datasets validate the robustness of CoreEval, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating performance overestimation caused by data contamination.</description>

      <title>Nemotron-Flash: Towards Latency-Optimal Hybrid Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient deployment of small language models (SLMs) is essential for numerous real-world applications with stringent latency constraints. While previous work on SLM design has primarily focused on reducing the number of parameters to achieve parameter-optimal SLMs, parameter efficiency does not necessarily translate into proportional real-device speed-ups. This work aims to identify the key determinants of SLMs' real-device latency and offer generalizable principles and methodologies for SLM design and training when real-device latency is the primary consideration. Specifically, we identify two central architectural factors: depth-width ratios and operator choices. The former is crucial for small-batch-size latency, while the latter affects both latency and large-batch-size throughput. In light of this, we first study latency-optimal depth-width ratios, with the key finding that although deep-thin models generally achieve better accuracy under the same parameter budget, they may not lie on the accuracy-latency trade-off frontier. Next, we explore emerging efficient attention alternatives to evaluate their potential as candidate building operators. Using the identified promising operators, we construct an evolutionary search framework to automatically discover latency-optimal combinations of these operators within hybrid SLMs, thereby advancing the accuracy-latency frontier. In addition to architectural improvements, we further enhance SLM training using a weight normalization technique that enables more effective weight updates and improves final convergence. Combining these methods, we introduce a new family of hybrid SLMs, called Nemotron-Flash, which significantly advances the accuracy-efficiency frontier of state-of-the-art SLMs, e.g., achieving over +5.5% average accuracy, 1.3x/1.9x lower latency, and 18.7x/45.6x higher throughput compared to Qwen3-1.7B/0.6B, respectively.</description>

      <title>MetaDCSeg: Robust Medical Image Segmentation via Meta Dynamic Center Weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but it is frequently disrupted by noisy annotations and ambiguous anatomical boundaries, which lead to instability in model training. Existing methods typically rely on global noise assumptions or confidence-based sample selection, which inadequately mitigate the performance degradation caused by annotation noise, especially in challenging boundary regions. To address this issue, we propose MetaDCSeg, a robust framework that dynamically learns optimal pixel-wise weights to suppress the influence of noisy ground-truth labels while preserving reliable annotations. By explicitly modeling boundary uncertainty through a Dynamic Center Distance (DCD) mechanism, our approach utilizes weighted feature distances for foreground, background, and boundary centers, directing the model's attention toward hard-to-segment pixels near ambiguous boundaries. This strategy enables more precise handling of structural boundaries, which are often overlooked by existing methods, and significantly enhances segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets with varying noise levels demonstrate that MetaDCSeg consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>VADE: Variance-Aware Dynamic Sampling via Online Sample-Level Difficulty Estimation for Multimodal RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group-based policy optimization methods like GRPO and GSPO have become standard for training multimodal models, leveraging group-wise rollouts and relative advantage estimation. However, they suffer from a critical \emph{gradient vanishing} problem when all responses within a group receive identical rewards, causing advantage estimates to collapse and training signals to diminish. Existing attempts to mitigate this issue fall into two paradigms: filtering-based and sampling-based methods. Filtering-based methods first generate rollouts broadly and then retroactively filter out uninformative groups, leading to substantial computational overhead. Sampling-based methods proactively select effective samples before rollout but rely on static criteria or prior dataset knowledge, lacking real-time adaptability. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{VADE}, a \textbf{V}ariance-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{D}ynamic sampling framework via online sample-level difficulty \textbf{E}stimation. Our framework integrates three key components: online sample-level difficulty estimation using Beta distributions, a Thompson sampler that maximizes information gain through the estimated correctness probability, and a two-scale prior decay mechanism that maintains robust estimation under policy evolution. This three components design enables VADE to dynamically select the most informative samples, thereby amplifying training signals while eliminating extra rollout costs. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that VADE consistently outperforms strong baselines in both performance and sample efficiency, while achieving a dramatic reduction in computational overhead. More importantly, our framework can serves as a plug-and-play component to be seamlessly integrated into existing group-based RL algorithms. Code and models are available at https://VADE-RL.github.io.</description>

      <title>How Learning Rate Decay Wastes Your Best Data in Curriculum-Based LLM Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the scarcity of high-quality data, large language models (LLMs) are often trained on mixtures of data with varying quality levels, even after sophisticated data curation. A natural approach to better leverage high-quality data is curriculum-based pretraining, where the model is trained on data sorted in ascending order of quality as determined by a quality metric. However, prior studies have reported limited improvements from such curriculum-based pretraining strategies. This work identifies a critical factor constraining these methods: the incompatibility between the ascending data quality order and the decaying learning rate (LR) schedule. We find that while curriculum-based training substantially outperforms random shuffling when using a constant LR, its advantage diminishes under standard LR decay schedules. Our experiments show this incompatibility can be mitigated by two simple strategies: (1) employing a more moderate LR decay schedule, where the final LR is only moderately smaller than the peak LR, and (2) replacing LR decay with model averaging, i.e., computing a weighted average of the final few checkpoints. By combining these strategies, we improve the average score on a suite of standard benchmarks by 1.64% over random shuffling, without additional data refinement. Validated on 1.5B-parameter models trained over 30B tokens with various data-quality metrics, our findings call for a re-evaluation of curriculum-based LLM pretraining and underscore the potential of co-designing data curricula with optimization methods.</description>

      <title>Learning What to Trust: Bayesian Prior-Guided Optimization for Visual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as an effective and lightweight framework for post-training visual generative models. However, its performance is fundamentally limited by the ambiguity of textual visual correspondence: a single prompt may validly describe diverse visual outputs, and a single image or video may support multiple equally correct interpretations. This many to many relationship leads reward models to generate uncertain and weakly discriminative signals, causing GRPO to underutilize reliable feedback and overfit noisy ones. We introduce Bayesian Prior-Guided Optimization (BPGO), a novel extension of GRPO that explicitly models reward uncertainty through a semantic prior anchor. BPGO adaptively modulates optimization trust at two levels: inter-group Bayesian trust allocation emphasizes updates from groups consistent with the prior while down-weighting ambiguous ones, and intra-group prior-anchored renormalization sharpens sample distinctions by expanding confident deviations and compressing uncertain scores. Across both image and video generation tasks, BPGO delivers consistently stronger semantic alignment, enhanced perceptual fidelity, and faster convergence than standard GRPO and recent variants.</description>

      <title>LLM-Driven Kernel Evolution: Automating Driver Updates in Linux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linux kernel evolution breaks drivers through API/ABI changes, semantic shifts, and security-hardening updates. We introduce DRIVEBENCH, an executable corpus of kernel$\rightarrow$driver co-evolution cases, and AUTODRIVER, a closed-loop, LLM-driven system for automating driver maintenance. The system integrates prompt engineering, multi-agent collaboration, static analysis, and iterative validation to ensure that generated patches are not only syntactically correct but also functionally and semantically consistent with kernel conventions. The corpus spans v5.10-v6.10 with 235 validated cases drawn from 612 candidates. In evaluation across 55 cases, AUTODRIVER achieves 56.4% compilation success; QEMU-based boot verification indicates that compiled patches preserve driver initialization in most instances. By releasing DRIVEBENCH and tooling, we enable reproducible research and a practical route to continuous, safe co-evolution of drivers with the Linux kernel.</description>

      <title>Learning Solution Operators for Partial Differential Equations via Monte Carlo-Type Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a lightweight architecture for learning solution operators for parametric PDEs by directly approximating the kernel integral using a Monte Carlo approach. Unlike Fourier Neural Operators, MCNO makes no spectral or translation-invariance assumptions. The kernel is represented as a learnable tensor over a fixed set of randomly sampled points. This design enables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on fixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO achieves competitive accuracy with low computational cost, providing a simple and practical alternative to spectral and graph-based neural operators.</description>

      <title>Look It Up: Analysing Internal Web Search Capabilities of Modern LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern large language models integrate web search to provide real-time answers, yet it remains unclear whether they are efficiently calibrated to use search when it is actually needed. We introduce a benchmark evaluating both the necessity and effectiveness of web access across commercial models with no access to internal states or parameters. The dataset includes a static split of 783 temporally anchored questions answerable from pre-cutoff knowledge, aimed at testing whether models invoke search based on low internal confidence, and a dynamic split of 288 post-cutoff queries designed to test whether models recognise when search is required and retrieve updated information. Web access substantially improves static accuracy for GPT-5-mini and Claude Haiku 4.5, though confidence calibration worsens. On dynamic queries, both models frequently invoke search yet remain below 70 percent accuracy due to weak query formulation. Costs per accuracy-improving call remain low, but returns diminish once initial retrieval fails. Selective invocation helps, but models become overconfident and inconsistent after search. Overall, built-in web search meaningfully improves factual accuracy and can be invoked selectively, yet models remain overconfident, skip retrieval when it is essential, and falter once initial search queries underperform. Taken together, internal web search works better as a good low-latency verification layer than a reliable analytical tool, with clear room for improvement.</description>

      <title>Defending Large Language Models Against Jailbreak Exploits with Responsible AI Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain susceptible to jailbreak exploits that bypass safety filters and induce harmful or unethical behavior. This work presents a systematic taxonomy of existing jailbreak defenses across prompt-level, model-level, and training-time interventions, followed by three proposed defense strategies. First, a Prompt-Level Defense Framework detects and neutralizes adversarial inputs through sanitization, paraphrasing, and adaptive system guarding. Second, a Logit-Based Steering Defense reinforces refusal behavior through inference-time vector steering in safety-sensitive layers. Third, a Domain-Specific Agent Defense employs the MetaGPT framework to enforce structured, role-based collaboration and domain adherence. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial reductions in attack success rate, achieving full mitigation under the agent-based defense. Overall, this study highlights how jailbreaks pose a significant security threat to LLMs and identifies key intervention points for prevention, while noting that defense strategies often involve trade-offs between safety, performance, and scalability.

      <description>arXiv:2511.18934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of translating natural language questions into query languages has long been a central focus in semantic parsing. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly accelerated progress in this field. However, existing studies typically focus on a single query language, resulting in methods with limited generalizability across different languages. In this paper, we formally define the Text-to-Query task paradigm, unifying semantic parsing tasks across various query languages. We identify query skeletons as a shared optimization target of Text-to-Query tasks, and propose a general dynamic data augmentation framework that explicitly diagnoses model-specific weaknesses in handling these skeletons to synthesize targeted training data. Experiments on four Text-to-Query benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a small amount of synthesized data, highlighting the efficiency and generality of our approach and laying a solid foundation for unified research on Text-to-Query tasks. We release our code at https://github.com/jjjycaptain/Skeletron.</description>

      <title>SWAN: Sparse Winnowed Attention for Reduced Inference Memory via Decompression-Free KV-Cache Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a significant bottleneck during autoregressive inference due to the massive memory footprint of the Key-Value (KV) cache. Existing compression techniques like token eviction, quantization, or other low-rank methods often risk information loss, have fixed limits, or introduce significant computational overhead from explicit decompression steps. In this work, we introduce SWAN, a novel, fine-tuning-free framework that eliminates this overhead. Our method uses an offline orthogonal matrix to rotate and prune the KV-cache, which is then used directly in the attention computation without any reconstruction. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAN, augmented with a small dense buffer, offers a robust trade-off, maintaining performance close to the uncompressed baseline even at aggressive 50-60% memory savings per-token on KV-cache. A key advantage is its runtime-tunable compression level, allowing operators to dynamically adjust the memory footprint, a flexibility absent in methods requiring fixed offline configurations. This combination of a decompression-free design, high performance under compression, and adaptability makes SWAN a practical and efficient solution for serving LLMs with long contexts.</description>

      <title>Learning to Compress Graphs via Dual Agents for Consistent Topological Robustness Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As graph-structured data grow increasingly large, evaluating their robustness under adversarial attacks becomes computationally expensive and difficult to scale. To address this challenge, we propose to compress graphs into compact representations that preserve both topological structure and robustness profile, enabling efficient and reliable evaluation.We propose Cutter, a dual-agent reinforcement learning framework composed of a Vital Detection Agent (VDA) and a Redundancy Detection Agent (RDA), which collaboratively identify structurally vital and redundant nodes for guided compression. Cutter incorporates three key strategies to enhance learning efficiency and compression quality: trajectory-level reward shaping to transform sparse trajectory returns into dense, policy-equivalent learning signals; prototype-based shaping to guide decisions using behavioral patterns from both highand low-return trajectories; and cross-agent imitation to enable safer and more transferable exploration. Experiments on multiple real-world graphs demonstrate that Cutter generates compressed graphs that retain essential static topological properties and exhibit robustness degradation trends highly consistent with the original graphs under various attack scenarios, thereby significantly improving evaluation efficiency without compromising assessment fidelity.</description>

Abstract: Pruning is an effective method for compressing Large Language Models, but finding an optimal, non-uniform layer-wise sparsity allocation remains a key challenge. While heuristic methods are fast but yield suboptimal performance, more powerful search-based approaches like Reinforcement Learning are often hindered by prohibitive computational costs on large-scale models. To overcome this efficiency barrier, we propose FastForward Pruning. Its core is a decoupled, single-step RL framework that separates policy optimization from the complex budget satisfaction problem. Such a decoupling is crucial for efficiently searching the vast policy space of LLMs. This curriculum-based strategy begins with low-cost, simple tasks and gradually increases in complexity, significantly reducing the search's computational overhead. Evaluated on the LLaMA, Mistral, and OPT model families, our framework discovers pruning policies that achieve superior performance over strong heuristic baselines. Crucially, when compared to other search-based algorithms, our method achieves competitive or superior results at a fraction of the computational cost, demonstrating a clear advantage in search efficiency.</description>

      <title>MOCLIP: A Foundation Model for Large-Scale Nanophotonic Inverse Design</title>

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) are transforming artificial intelligence by enabling generalizable, data-efficient solutions across different domains for a broad range of applications. However, the lack of large and diverse datasets limits the development of FM in nanophotonics. This work presents MOCLIP (Metasurface Optics Contrastive Learning Pretrained), a nanophotonic foundation model that integrates metasurface geometry and spectra within a shared latent space. MOCLIP employs contrastive learning to align geometry and spectral representations using an experimentally acquired dataset with a sample density comparable to ImageNet-1K. The study demonstrates MOCLIP inverse design capabilities for high-throughput zero-shot prediction at a rate of 0.2 million samples per second, enabling the design of a full 4-inch wafer populated with high-density metasurfaces in minutes. It also shows generative latent-space optimization reaching 97 percent accuracy. Finally, we introduce an optical information storage concept that uses MOCLIP to achieve a density of 0.1 Gbit per square millimeter at the resolution limit, exceeding commercial optical media by a factor of six. These results position MOCLIP as a scalable and versatile platform for next-generation photonic design and data-driven applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Mixture of Experts Against Severe Distribution Shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenge of building neural networks that can continuously learn and adapt to evolving data streams is central to the fields of continual learning (CL) and reinforcement learning (RL). This lifelong learning problem is often framed in terms of the plasticity-stability dilemma, focusing on issues like loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting. Unlike neural networks, biological brains maintain plasticity through capacity growth, inspiring researchers to explore similar approaches in artificial networks, such as adding capacity dynamically. Prior solutions often lack parameter efficiency or depend on explicit task indices, but Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures offer a promising alternative by specializing experts for distinct distributions. This paper aims to evaluate a DynamicMoE approach for continual and reinforcement learning environments and benchmark its effectiveness against existing network expansion methods.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Plant Disease Diagnosis: Bridging the Academic-Practical Gap with Vision Transformers and Zero-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have enabled significant progress in plant disease classification using leaf images. Much of the existing research in this field has relied on the PlantVillage dataset, which consists of well-centered plant images captured against uniform, uncluttered backgrounds. Although models trained on this dataset achieve high accuracy, they often fail to generalize to real-world field images, such as those submitted by farmers to plant diagnostic systems. This has created a significant gap between published studies and practical application requirements, highlighting the necessity of investigating and addressing this issue. In this study, we investigate whether attention-based architectures and zero-shot learning approaches can bridge the gap between curated academic datasets and real-world agricultural conditions in plant disease classification. We evaluate three model categories: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers, and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based zero-shot models. While CNNs exhibit limited robustness under domain shift, Vision Transformers demonstrate stronger generalization by capturing global contextual features. Most notably, CLIP models classify diseases directly from natural language descriptions without any task-specific training, offering strong adaptability and interpretability. These findings highlight the potential of zero-shot learning as a practical and scalable domain adaptation strategy for plant health diagnosis in diverse field environments.</description>

      <title>Classification EM-PCA for clustering and embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mixture model is undoubtedly one of the greatest contributions to clustering. For continuous data, Gaussian models are often used and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is particularly suitable for estimating parameters from which clustering is inferred. If these models are particularly popular in various domains including image clustering, they however suffer from the dimensionality and also from the slowness of convergence of the EM algorithm. However, the Classification EM (CEM) algorithm, a classifying version, offers a fast convergence solution while dimensionality reduction still remains a challenge. Thus we propose in this paper an algorithm combining simultaneously and non-sequentially the two tasks --Data embedding and Clustering-- relying on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and CEM. We demonstrate the interest of such approach in terms of clustering and data embedding. We also establish different connections with other clustering approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current KM3NeT/ORCA neutrino telescope, still under construction, has not yet reached its full potential in neutrino reconstruction capability. When training any deep learning model, no explicit information about the physics or the detector is provided, thus they remain unknown to the model. This study leverages the strengths of transformers by incorporating attention masks inspired by the physics and detector design, making the model understand both the telescope design and the neutrino physics measured on it. The study also shows the efficacy of transformers on retaining valuable information between detectors when doing fine-tuning from one configurations to another.</description>

      <title>OrdMoE: Preference Alignment via Hierarchical Expert Group Ranking in Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preference learning has recently emerged as a pivotal strategy for post-training alignment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly rely on external human-annotated preference data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. In this work, we propose OrdMoE, a novel preference alignment framework that bypasses the reliance on external human preferences entirely by leveraging intrinsic signals within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. Specifically, we observe that the router's expert selection scores implicitly encode a quality-aware ranking of responses (i.e. higher-scoring experts consistently generate higher-quality outputs). Building on this insight, OrdMoE constructs an internal preference hierarchy by grouping experts into ranked tiers based on their per-token routing scores and activating each tier separately to produce a sequence of responses with increasing quality. This yields a zero-cost, self-supervised preference ordering over generated responses, which can be directly optimized using standard preference learning objectives. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demnstrate that OrdMoE significantly enhances both alignment and overall performance of multimodal Mixture-of-Experts LLMs, achieving competitive results without requiring any human-annotated preference data.</description>

      <title>Life-IQA: Boosting Blind Image Quality Assessment through GCN-enhanced Layer Interaction and MoE-based Feature Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) plays a crucial role in evaluating and optimizing visual experience. Most existing BIQA approaches fuse shallow and deep features extracted from backbone networks, while overlooking the unequal contributions to quality prediction. Moreover, while various vision encoder backbones are widely adopted in BIQA, the effective quality decoding architectures remain underexplored. To address these limitations, this paper investigates the contributions of shallow and deep features to BIQA, and proposes a effective quality feature decoding framework via GCN-enhanced \underline{l}ayer\underline{i}nteraction and MoE-based \underline{f}eature d\underline{e}coupling, termed \textbf{(Life-IQA)}. Specifically, the GCN-enhanced layer interaction module utilizes the GCN-enhanced deepest-layer features as query and the penultimate-layer features as key, value, then performs cross-attention to achieve feature interaction. Moreover, a MoE-based feature decoupling module is proposed to decouple fused representations though different experts specialized for specific distortion types or quality dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Life-IQA shows more favorable balance between accuracy and cost than a vanilla Transformer decoder and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple BIQA benchmarks.The code is available at: \href{https://github.com/TANGLONG2/Life-IQA/tree/main}{\texttt{Life-IQA}}.</description>

      <title>CSD: Change Semantic Detection with only Semantic Change Masks for Damage Assessment in Conflict Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately and swiftly assessing damage from conflicts is crucial for humanitarian aid and regional stability. In conflict zones, damaged zones often share similar architectural styles, with damage typically covering small areas and exhibiting blurred boundaries. These characteristics lead to limited data, annotation difficulties, and significant recognition challenges, including high intra-class similarity and ambiguous semantic changes. To address these issues, we introduce a pre-trained DINOv3 model and propose a multi-scale cross-attention difference siamese network (MC-DiSNet). The powerful visual representation capability of the DINOv3 backbone enables robust and rich feature extraction from bi-temporal remote sensing images. We also release a new Gaza-change dataset containing high-resolution satellite image pairs from 2023-2024 with pixel-level semantic change annotations. It is worth emphasizing that our annotations only include semantic pixels of changed areas. Unlike conventional semantic change detection (SCD), our approach eliminates the need for large-scale semantic annotations of bi-temporal images, instead focusing directly on the changed regions. We term this new task change semantic detection (CSD). The CSD task represents a direct extension of binary change detection (BCD). Due to the limited spatial extent of semantic regions, it presents greater challenges than traditional SCD tasks. We evaluated our method under the CSD framework on both the Gaza-Change and SECOND datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively addresses the CSD task, and its outstanding performance paves the way for practical applications in rapid damage assessment across conflict zones.</description>

      <title>MedSAM3: Delving into Segment Anything with Medical Concepts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental for biomedical discovery. Existing methods lack generalizability and demand extensive, time-consuming manual annotation for new clinical application. Here, we propose MedSAM-3, a text promptable medical segmentation model for medical image and video segmentation. By fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3 architecture on medical images paired with semantic conceptual labels, our MedSAM-3 enables medical Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS), allowing precise targeting of anatomical structures via open-vocabulary text descriptions rather than solely geometric prompts. We further introduce the MedSAM-3 Agent, a framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform complex reasoning and iterative refinement in an agent-in-the-loop workflow. Comprehensive experiments across diverse medical imaging modalities, including X-ray, MRI, Ultrasound, CT, and video, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing specialist and foundation models. We will release our code and model at https://github.com/Joey-S-Liu/MedSAM3.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-Assisted Planning of Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure with Real-World Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure presents significant planning challenges, requiring efficient strategies for investment and operation to deliver cost-effective charging services. However, the potential benefits of EV charging assignment, particularly in response to varying spatial-temporal patterns of charging demand, remain under-explored in infrastructure planning. This paper proposes an integrated approach that jointly optimizes investment decisions and charging assignments while accounting for spatial-temporal demand dynamics and their interdependencies. To support efficient model development, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to assist in generating and refining the mathematical formulation from structured natural-language descriptions, significantly reducing the modeling burden. The resulting optimization model enables optimal joint decision-making for investment and operation. Additionally, we propose a distributed optimization algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to address computational complexity in high-dimensional scenarios, which can be executed on standard computing platforms. We validate our approach through a case study using 1.5 million real-world travel records from Chengdu, China, demonstrating a 30% reduction in total cost compared to a baseline without EV assignment.</description>

      <title>Understanding, Accelerating, and Improving MeanFlow Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MeanFlow promises high-quality generative modeling in few steps, by jointly learning instantaneous and average velocity fields. Yet, the underlying training dynamics remain unclear. We analyze the interaction between the two velocities and find: (i) well-established instantaneous velocity is a prerequisite for learning average velocity; (ii) learning of instantaneous velocity benefits from average velocity when the temporal gap is small, but degrades as the gap increases; and (iii) task-affinity analysis indicates that smooth learning of large-gap average velocities, essential for one-step generation, depends on the prior formation of accurate instantaneous and small-gap average velocities. Guided by these observations, we design an effective training scheme that accelerates the formation of instantaneous velocity, then shifts emphasis from short- to long-interval average velocity. Our enhanced MeanFlow training yields faster convergence and significantly better few-step generation: With the same DiT-XL backbone, our method reaches an impressive FID of 2.87 on 1-NFE ImageNet 256x256, compared to 3.43 for the conventional MeanFlow baseline. Alternatively, our method matches the performance of the MeanFlow baseline with 2.5x shorter training time, or with a smaller DiT-L backbone.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Participation Imbalance Bias in Asynchronous Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL), the central server immediately updates the global model with each arriving client's contribution. As a result, clients perform their local training on different model versions, causing information staleness (delay). In federated environments with non-IID local data distributions, this asynchronous pattern amplifies the adverse effect of client heterogeneity (due to different data distribution, local objectives, etc.), as faster clients contribute more frequent updates, biasing the global model. We term this phenomenon heterogeneity amplification. Our work provides a theoretical analysis that maps AFL design choices to their resulting error sources when heterogeneity amplification occurs. Guided by our analysis, we propose ACE (All-Client Engagement AFL), which mitigates participation imbalance through immediate, non-buffered updates that use the latest information available from all clients. We also introduce a delay-aware variant, ACED, to balance client diversity against update staleness. Experiments on different models for different tasks across diverse heterogeneity and delay settings validate our analysis and demonstrate the robust performance of our approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizable person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to recognize individuals across unseen cameras and environments. While existing methods rely heavily on limited labeled multi-camera data, we propose DynaMix, a novel method that effectively combines manually labeled multi-camera and large-scale pseudo-labeled single-camera data. Unlike prior works, DynaMix dynamically adapts to the structure and noise of the training data through three core components: (1) a Relabeling Module that refines pseudo-labels of single-camera identities on-the-fly; (2) an Efficient Centroids Module that maintains robust identity representations under a large identity space; and (3) a Data Sampling Module that carefully composes mixed data mini-batches to balance learning complexity and intra-batch diversity. All components are specifically designed to operate efficiently at scale, enabling effective training on millions of images and hundreds of thousands of identities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaMix consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalizable person Re-ID.</description>

      <title>GraphMind: Theorem Selection and Conclusion Generation Framework with Dynamic GNN for LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, including multi-step reasoning such as mathematical proving. However, existing approaches often lack an explicit and dynamic mechanism to structurally represent and evolve intermediate reasoning states, which limits their ability to perform context-aware theorem selection and iterative conclusion generation. To address these challenges, we propose GraphMind, a novel dynamic graph-based framework that integrates the graph neural network (GNN) with LLMs to iteratively select theorems and generate intermediate conclusions for multi-step reasoning. Our method models the reasoning process as a heterogeneous evolving graph, where nodes represent conditions, theorems, and conclusions, while edges capture logical dependencies between nodes. By encoding the current reasoning state with GNN and leveraging semantic matching for theorem selection, our framework enables context-aware, interpretable, and structured reasoning in a closed-loop manner. Experiments on various question-answering (QA) datasets demonstrate that our proposed GraphMind method achieves consistent performance improvements and significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-step reasoning, validating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.</description>

      <title>EnfoPath: Energy-Informed Analysis of Generative Trajectories in Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow-based generative models synthesize data by integrating a learned velocity field from a reference distribution to the target data distribution. Prior work has focused on endpoint metrics (e.g., fidelity, likelihood, perceptual quality) while overlooking a deeper question: what do the sampling trajectories reveal? Motivated by classical mechanics, we introduce kinetic path energy (KPE), a simple yet powerful diagnostic that quantifies the total kinetic effort along each generation path of ODE-based samplers. Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-256, we uncover two key phenomena: ({i}) higher KPE predicts stronger semantic quality, indicating that semantically richer samples require greater kinetic effort, and ({ii}) higher KPE inversely correlates with data density, with informative samples residing in sparse, low-density regions. Together, these findings reveal that semantically informative samples naturally reside on the sparse frontier of the data distribution, demanding greater generative effort. Our results suggest that trajectory-level analysis offers a physics-inspired and interpretable framework for understanding generation difficulty and sample characteristics.</description>

      <title>The Core in Max-Loss Non-Centroid Clustering Can Be Empty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study core stability in non-centroid clustering under the max-loss objective, where each agent's loss is the maximum distance to other members of their cluster. We prove that for all $k\geq 3$ there exist metric instances with $n\ge 9$ agents, with $n$ divisible by $k$, for which no clustering lies in the $\alpha$-core for any $\alpha&lt;2^{\frac{1}{5}}\sim 1.148$. The bound is tight for our construction. Using a computer-aided proof, we also identify a two-dimensional Euclidean point set whose associated lower bound is slightly smaller than that of our general construction. This is, to our knowledge, the first impossibility result showing that the core can be empty in non-centroid clustering under the max-loss objective.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural Operator Learning for Nonlinear Grad-Shafranov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence emerges as a transformative enabler for fusion energy commercialization, fast and accurate solvers become increasingly critical. In magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, rapid and accurate solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE) is essential for real-time plasma control and analysis. Traditional numerical solvers achieve high precision but are computationally prohibitive, while data-driven surrogates infer quickly but fail to enforce physical laws and generalize poorly beyond training distributions. To address this challenge, we present a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) that directly learns the GSE solution operator, mapping shape parameters of last closed flux surface to equilibrium solutions for realistic nonlinear current profiles. Comprehensive benchmarking of five neural architectures identifies the novel Transformer-KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) Neural Operator (TKNO) as achieving highest accuracy (0.25% mean L2 relative error) under supervised training (only data-driven). However, all data-driven models exhibit large physics residuals, indicating poor physical consistency. Our unsupervised training can reduce the residuals by nearly four orders of magnitude through embedding physics-based loss terms without labeled data. Critically, semi-supervised learning--integrating sparse labeled data (100 interior points) with physics constraints--achieves optimal balance: 0.48% interpolation error and the most robust extrapolation performance (4.76% error, 8.9x degradation factor vs 39.8x for supervised models). Accelerated by TensorRT optimization, our models enable millisecond-level inference, establishing PINO as a promising pathway for next-generation fusion control systems.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality of Discrete Object Naming: a Kinship Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of naming systems in natural languages hinges on a trade-off between high informativeness and low complexity. Prior work capitalizes on information theory to formalize these notions; however, these studies generally rely on two simplifications: (i) optimal listeners, and (ii) universal communicative need across languages. Here, we address these limitations by introducing an information-theoretic framework for discrete object naming systems, and we use it to prove that an optimal trade-off is achievable if and only if the listener's decoder is equivalent to the Bayesian decoder of the speaker. Adopting a referential game setup from emergent communication, and focusing on the semantic domain of kinship, we show that our notion of optimality is not only theoretically achievable but also emerges empirically in learned communication systems.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Deep Learning Framework for Remaining Useful Life Prediction in Turbofan Engines with Learned Aleatoric Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction coupled with uncertainty quantification remains a critical challenge in aerospace prognostics. This research introduces a novel uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that learns aleatoric uncertainty directly through probabilistic modeling, an approach unexplored in existing CMAPSS-based literature. Our hierarchical architecture integrates multi-scale Inception blocks for temporal pattern extraction, bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks for sequential modeling, and a dual-level attention mechanism operating simultaneously on sensor and temporal dimensions. The innovation lies in the Bayesian output layer that predicts both mean RUL and variance, enabling the model to learn data-inherent uncertainty. Comprehensive preprocessing employs condition-aware clustering, wavelet denoising, and intelligent feature selection. Experimental validation on NASA CMAPSS benchmarks (FD001-FD004) demonstrates competitive overall performance with RMSE values of 16.22, 19.29, 16.84, and 19.98 respectively. Remarkably, our framework achieves breakthrough critical zone performance (RUL &lt;= 30 cycles) with RMSE of 5.14, 6.89, 5.27, and 7.16, representing 25-40 percent improvements over conventional approaches and establishing new benchmarks for safety-critical predictions. The learned uncertainty provides well-calibrated 95 percent confidence intervals with coverage ranging from 93.5 percent to 95.2 percent, enabling risk-aware maintenance scheduling previously unattainable in CMAPSS literature.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Posts: Retrieval-Augmented Fashion Captioning and Hashtag Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the retrieval-augmented framework for automatic fashion caption and hashtag generation, combining multi-garment detection, attribute reasoning, and Large Language Model (LLM) prompting. The system aims to produce visually grounded, descriptive, and stylistically interesting text for fashion imagery, overcoming the limitations of end-to-end captioners that have problems with attribute fidelity and domain generalization. The pipeline combines a YOLO-based detector for multi-garment localization, k-means clustering for dominant color extraction, and a CLIP-FAISS retrieval module for fabric and gender attribute inference based on a structured product index. These attributes, together with retrieved style examples, create a factual evidence pack that is used to guide an LLM to generate human-like captions and contextually rich hashtags. A fine-tuned BLIP model is used as a supervised baseline model for comparison. Experimental results show that the YOLO detector is able to obtain a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.71 for nine categories of garments. The RAG-LLM pipeline generates expressive attribute-aligned captions and achieves mean attribute coverage of 0.80 with full coverage at the 50% threshold in hashtag generation, whereas BLIP gives higher lexical overlap and lower generalization. The retrieval-augmented approach exhibits better factual grounding, less hallucination, and great potential for scalable deployment in various clothing domains. These results demonstrate the use of retrieval-augmented generation as an effective and interpretable paradigm for automated and visually grounded fashion content generation.</description>

      <title>Information Physics of Intelligence: Unifying Logical Depth and Entropy under Thermodynamic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid scaling of artificial intelligence models has revealed a fundamental tension between model capacity (storage) and inference efficiency (computation). While classical information theory focuses on transmission and storage limits, it lacks a unified physical framework to quantify the thermodynamic costs of generating information from compressed laws versus retrieving it from memory. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that treats information processing as an enabling mapping from ontological states to carrier states. We introduce a novel metric, Derivation Entropy, which quantifies the effective work required to compute a target state from a given logical depth. By analyzing the interplay between Shannon entropy (storage) and computational complexity (time/energy), we demonstrate the existence of a critical phase transition point. Below this threshold, memory retrieval is thermodynamically favorable; above it, generative computation becomes the optimal strategy. This "Energy-Time-Space" conservation law provides a physical explanation for the efficiency of generative models and offers a rigorous mathematical bound for designing next-generation, energy-efficient AI architectures. Our findings suggest that the minimization of Derivation Entropy is a governing principle for the evolution of both biological and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>LLM-Based Agentic Negotiation for 6G: Addressing Uncertainty Neglect and Tail-Event Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A critical barrier to the trustworthiness of sixth-generation (6G) agentic autonomous networks is the uncertainty neglect bias; a cognitive tendency for large language model (LLM)-powered agents to make high-stakes decisions based on simple averages while ignoring the tail risk of extreme events. This paper proposes an unbiased, risk-aware framework for agentic negotiation, designed to ensure robust resource allocation in 6G network slicing. Specifically, agents leverage Digital Twins (DTs) to predict full latency distributions, which are then evaluated using a formal framework from extreme value theory, namely, Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). This approach fundamentally shifts the agent's objective from reasoning over the mean to reasoning over the tail, thereby building a statistically-grounded buffer against worst-case outcomes. Furthermore, our framework ensures full uncertainty awareness by requiring agents to quantify epistemic uncertainty -- confidence in their own DTs predictions -- and propagate this meta-verification to make robust decisions, preventing them from acting on unreliable data. We validate this framework in a 6G inter-slice negotiation use-case between an eMBB and a URLLC agent. The results demonstrate the profound failure of the biased, mean-based baseline, which consistently fails its SLAs with a 25\% rate. Our unbiased, CVaR-aware agent successfully mitigates this bias, eliminating SLA violations and reducing the URLLC and eMBB p99.999 latencies by around 11\%. We show this reliability comes at the rational and quantifiable cost of slightly reduced energy savings to 17\%, exposing the false economy of the biased approach. This work provides a concrete methodology for building the trustworthy autonomous systems required for 6G.</description>

      <title>Torsion-Space Diffusion for Protein Backbone Generation with Geometric Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing new protein structures is fundamental to computational biology, enabling advances in therapeutic molecule discovery and enzyme engineering. Existing diffusion-based generative models typically operate in Cartesian coordinate space, where adding noise disrupts strict geometric constraints such as fixed bond lengths and angles, often producing physically invalid structures. To address this limitation, we propose a Torsion-Space Diffusion Model that generates protein backbones by denoising torsion angles, ensuring perfect local geometry by construction. A differentiable forward-kinematics module reconstructs 3D coordinates with fixed 3.8 Angstrom backbone bond lengths while a constrained post-processing refinement optimizes global compactness via Radius of Gyration (Rg) correction, without violating bond constraints. Experiments on standard PDB proteins demonstrate 100% bond-length accuracy and significantly improved structural compactness, reducing Rg error from 70% to 18.6% compared to Cartesian diffusion baselines. Overall, this hybrid torsion-diffusion plus geometric-refinement framework generates physically valid and compact protein backbones, providing a promising path toward full-atom protein generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contradictory multimodal inputs are common in real-world settings, yet existing benchmarks typically assume input consistency and fail to evaluate cross-modal contradiction detection - a fundamental capability for preventing hallucinations and ensuring reliability. We introduce CLASH, a novel benchmark for multimodal contradiction detection, featuring COCO images paired with contradictory captions containing controlled object-level or attribute-level contradictions. The samples include targeted questions evaluated in both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. The benchmark provides an extensive fine-tuning set filtered through automated quality checks, alongside a smaller human-verified diagnostic set. Our analysis of state-of-the-art models reveals substantial limitations in recognizing cross-modal conflicts, exposing systematic modality biases and category-specific weaknesses. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that targeted fine-tuning on CLASH substantially enhances conflict detection capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in web services, delivering unprecedented capabilities while amplifying societal risks. Existing works tend to focus on either isolated jailbreak attacks or static defenses, neglecting the dynamic interplay between evolving threats and safeguards in real-world web contexts. To mitigate these challenges, we propose ACE-Safety (Adversarial Co-Evolution for LLM Safety), a novel framework that jointly optimize attack and defense models by seamlessly integrating two key innovative procedures: (1) Group-aware Strategy-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (GS-MCTS), which efficiently explores jailbreak strategies to uncover vulnerabilities and generate diverse adversarial samples; (2) Adversarial Curriculum Tree-aware Group Policy Optimization (AC-TGPO), which jointly trains attack and defense LLMs with challenging samples via curriculum reinforcement learning, enabling robust mutual improvement. Evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing attack and defense approaches, and provides a feasible pathway for developing LLMs that can sustainably support responsible AI ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Are Large Vision Language Models Truly Grounded in Medical Images? Evidence from Italian Clinical Visual Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on medical visual question answering benchmarks, yet their reliance on visual information remains unclear. We investigate whether frontier VLMs demonstrate genuine visual grounding when answering Italian medical questions by testing four state-of-the-art models: Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o, GPT-5-mini, and Gemini 2.0 flash exp. Using 60 questions from the EuropeMedQA Italian dataset that explicitly require image interpretation, we substitute correct medical images with blank placeholders to test whether models truly integrate visual and textual information. Our results reveal striking variability in visual dependency: GPT-4o shows the strongest visual grounding with a 27.9pp accuracy drop (83.2% [74.6%, 91.7%] to 55.3% [44.1%, 66.6%]), while GPT-5-mini, Gemini, and Claude maintain high accuracy with modest drops of 8.5pp, 2.4pp, and 5.6pp respectively. Analysis of model-generated reasoning reveals confident explanations for fabricated visual interpretations across all models, suggesting varying degrees of reliance on textual shortcuts versus genuine visual analysis. These findings highlight critical differences in model robustness and the need for rigorous evaluation before clinical deployment.</description>

      <title>Learning Plug-and-play Memory for Guiding Video Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformer(DiT) based video generation models have recently achieved impressive visual quality and temporal coherence, but they still frequently violate basic physical laws and commonsense dynamics, revealing a lack of explicit world knowledge. In this work, we explore how to equip them with a plug-and-play memory that injects useful world knowledge. Motivated by in-context memory in Transformer-based LLMs, we conduct empirical studies to show that DiT can be steered via interventions on its hidden states, and simple low-pass and high-pass filters in the embedding space naturally disentangle low-level appearance and high-level physical/semantic cues, enabling targeted guidance. Building on these observations, we propose a learnable memory encoder DiT-Mem, composed of stacked 3D CNNs, low-/high-pass filters, and self-attention layers. The encoder maps reference videos into a compact set of memory tokens, which are concatenated as the memory within the DiT self-attention layers. During training, we keep the diffusion backbone frozen, and only optimize the memory encoder. It yields a rather efficient training process on few training parameters (150M) and 10K data samples, and enables plug-and-play usage at inference time. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving physical rule following and video fidelity. Our code and data are publicly released here: https://thrcle421.github.io/DiT-Mem-Web/.</description>

      <title>In Machina N400: Pinpointing Where a Causal Language Model Detects Semantic Violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How and where does a transformer notice that a sentence has gone semantically off the rails? To explore this question, we evaluated the causal language model (phi-2) using a carefully curated corpus, with sentences that concluded plausibly or implausibly. Our analysis focused on the hidden states sampled at each model layer. To investigate how violations are encoded, we utilized two complementary probes. First, we conducted a per-layer detection using a linear probe. Our findings revealed that a simple linear decoder struggled to distinguish between plausible and implausible endings in the lowest third of the model's layers. However, its accuracy sharply increased in the middle blocks, reaching a peak just before the top layers. Second, we examined the effective dimensionality of the encoded violation. Initially, the violation widens the representational subspace, followed by a collapse after a mid-stack bottleneck. This might indicate an exploratory phase that transitions into rapid consolidation. Taken together, these results contemplate the idea of alignment with classical psycholinguistic findings in human reading, where semantic anomalies are detected only after syntactic resolution, occurring later in the online processing sequence.</description>

      <title>SENTINEL: A Fully End-to-End Language-Action Model for Humanoid Whole Body Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing humanoid control systems often rely on teleoperation or modular generation pipelines that separate language understanding from physical execution. However, the former is entirely human-driven, and the latter lacks tight alignment between language commands and physical behaviors. In this paper, we present SENTINEL, a fully end-to-end language-action model for humanoid whole-body control. We construct a large-scale dataset by tracking human motions in simulation using a pretrained whole body controller, combined with their text annotations. The model directly maps language commands and proprioceptive inputs to low-level actions without any intermediate representation. The model generates action chunks using flow matching, which can be subsequently refined by a residual action head for real-world deployment. Our method exhibits strong semantic understanding and stable execution on humanoid robots in both simulation and real-world deployment, and also supports multi-modal extensions by converting inputs into texts.</description>

      <title>Local Entropy Search over Descent Sequences for Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searching large and complex design spaces for a global optimum can be infeasible and unnecessary. A practical alternative is to iteratively refine the neighborhood of an initial design using local optimization methods such as gradient descent. We propose local entropy search (LES), a Bayesian optimization paradigm that explicitly targets the solutions reachable by the descent sequences of iterative optimizers. The algorithm propagates the posterior belief over the objective through the optimizer, resulting in a probability distribution over descent sequences. It then selects the next evaluation by maximizing mutual information with that distribution, using a combination of analytic entropy calculations and Monte-Carlo sampling of descent sequences. Empirical results on high-complexity synthetic objectives and benchmark problems show that LES achieves strong sample efficiency compared to existing local and global Bayesian optimization methods.</description>

      <title>Neural Architecture Search for Quantum Autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning and deep learning have driven advances in domains such as image classification, speech recognition, and anomaly detection by leveraging multi-layer neural networks to model complex data. Simultaneously, quantum computing (QC) promises to address classically intractable problems via quantum parallelism, motivating research in quantum machine learning (QML). Among QML techniques, quantum autoencoders show promise for compressing high-dimensional quantum and classical data. However, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for quantum autoencoders remains challenging due to the complexity of selecting gates, arranging circuit layers, and tuning parameters.
  This paper proposes a neural architecture search (NAS) framework that automates the design of quantum autoencoders using a genetic algorithm (GA). By systematically evolving variational quantum circuit (VQC) configurations, our method seeks to identify high-performing hybrid quantum-classical autoencoders for data reconstruction without becoming trapped in local minima. We demonstrate effectiveness on image datasets, highlighting the potential of quantum autoencoders for efficient feature extraction within a noise-prone, near-term quantum era. Our approach lays a foundation for broader application of genetic algorithms to quantum architecture search, aiming for a robust, automated method that can adapt to varied data and hardware constraints.</description>

      <title>MAESTRO: Multi-Agent Environment Shaping through Task and Reward Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) faces two major design bottlenecks: crafting dense reward functions and constructing curricula that avoid local optima in high-dimensional, non-stationary environments. Existing approaches rely on fixed heuristics or use Large Language Models (LLMs) directly in the control loop, which is costly and unsuitable for real-time systems. We propose MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment Shaping through Task and Reward Optimization), a framework that moves the LLM outside the execution loop and uses it as an offline training architect. MAESTRO introduces two generative components: (i) a semantic curriculum generator that creates diverse, performance-driven traffic scenarios, and (ii) an automated reward synthesizer that produces executable Python reward functions adapted to evolving curriculum difficulty. These components guide a standard MARL backbone (MADDPG) without increasing inference cost at deployment. We evaluate MAESTRO on large-scale traffic signal control (Hangzhou, 16 intersections) and conduct controlled ablations. Results show that combining LLM-generated curricula with LLM-generated reward shaping yields improved performance and stability. Across four seeds, the full system achieves +4.0% higher mean return (163.26 vs. 156.93) and 2.2% better risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe 1.53 vs. 0.70) over a strong curriculum baseline. These findings highlight LLMs as effective high-level designers for cooperative MARL training.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Patch Attacks on Vision-Based Cargo Occupancy Estimation via Differentiable 3D Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer vision systems are increasingly adopted in modern logistics operations, including the estimation of trailer occupancy for planning, routing, and billing. Although effective, such systems may be vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks, particularly adversarial patches that can be printed and placed on interior surfaces. In this work, we study the feasibility of such attacks on a convolutional cargo-occupancy classifier using fully simulated 3D environments. Using Mitsuba 3 for differentiable rendering, we optimize patch textures across variations in geometry, lighting, and viewpoint, and compare their effectiveness to a 2D compositing baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that 3D-optimized patches achieve high attack success rates, especially in a denial-of-service scenario (empty to full), where success reaches 84.94 percent. Concealment attacks (full to empty) prove more challenging but still reach 30.32 percent. We analyze the factors influencing attack success, discuss implications for the security of automated logistics pipelines, and highlight directions for strengthening physical robustness. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate adversarial patch attacks for cargo-occupancy estimation in physically realistic, fully simulated 3D scenes.</description>

      <title>Medusa: Cross-Modal Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Multimodal Medical Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of retrieval-augmented vision-language models, multimodal medical retrieval-augmented generation (MMed-RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support. These systems enhance medical applications by performing cross-modal retrieval to integrate relevant visual and textual evidence for tasks, e.g., report generation and disease diagnosis. However, their complex architecture also introduces underexplored adversarial vulnerabilities, particularly via visual input perturbations. In this paper, we propose Medusa, a novel framework for crafting cross-modal transferable adversarial attacks on MMed-RAG systems under a black-box setting. Specifically, Medusa formulates the attack as a perturbation optimization problem, leveraging a multi-positive InfoNCE loss (MPIL) to align adversarial visual embeddings with medically plausible but malicious textual targets, thereby hijacking the retrieval process. To enhance transferability, we adopt a surrogate model ensemble and design a dual-loop optimization strategy augmented with invariant risk minimization (IRM). Extensive experiments on two real-world medical tasks, including medical report generation and disease diagnosis, demonstrate that Medusa achieves over 90% average attack success rate across various generation models and retrievers under appropriate parameter configuration, while remaining robust against four mainstream defenses, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our results reveal critical vulnerabilities in the MMed-RAG systems and highlight the necessity of robustness benchmarking in safety-critical medical applications.

      <description>arXiv:2511.19260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hunger and satiety dynamics shape dietary behaviors and metabolic health, yet remain difficult to capture in everyday settings. We present a Nutrition Photoplethysmography Language Model (NPLM), integrating continuous photoplethysmography (PPG) from wearables with meal descriptions. NPLM projects PPG into embeddings interpretable by language models, enabling joint reasoning over physiology and meal context. Trained on 19,340 participants and 1.1 million meal-PPG pairs, the model improved daily caloric intake prediction by 11% over text-only baselines, with accuracy maintained when 80% of meal text was removed. In an independent validation study (n=140) with controlled dining and detailed meal information, the model replicated these findings. These results demonstrate the value of integrating physiological measurements from consumer wearables with meal information for noninvasive dietary monitoring at scale.</description>

      <title>Solar-GECO: Perovskite Solar Cell Property Prediction with Geometric-Aware Co-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells are promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaics. However, their performance as multi-scale devices is determined by complex interactions between their constituent layers. This creates a vast combinatorial space of possible materials and device architectures, making the conventional experimental-based screening process slow and expensive. Machine learning models try to address this problem, but they only focus on individual material properties or neglect the important geometric information of the perovskite crystal. To address this problem, we propose to predict perovskite solar cell power conversion efficiency with a geometric-aware co-attention (Solar-GECO) model. Solar-GECO combines a geometric graph neural network (GNN) - that directly encodes the atomic structure of the perovskite absorber - with language model embeddings that process the textual strings representing the chemical compounds of the transport layers and other device components. Solar-GECO also integrates a co-attention module to capture intra-layer dependencies and inter-layer interactions, while a probabilistic regression head predicts both power conversion efficiency (PCE) and its associated uncertainty. Solar-GECO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming several baselines, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) for PCE prediction from 3.066 to 2.936 compared to semantic GNN (the previous state-of-the-art model). Solar-GECO demonstrates that integrating geometric and textual information provides a more powerful and accurate framework for PCE prediction.</description>

      <title>Interpreting GFlowNets for Drug Discovery: Extracting Actionable Insights for Medicinal Chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Flow Networks, or GFlowNets, offer a promising framework for molecular design, but their internal decision policies remain opaque. This limits adoption in drug discovery, where chemists require clear and interpretable rationales for proposed structures. We present an interpretability framework for SynFlowNet, a GFlowNet trained on documented chemical reactions and purchasable starting materials that generates both molecules and the synthetic routes that produce them. Our approach integrates three complementary components. Gradient based saliency combined with counterfactual perturbations identifies which atomic environments influence reward and how structural edits change molecular outcomes. Sparse autoencoders reveal axis aligned latent factors that correspond to physicochemical properties such as polarity, lipophilicity, and molecular size. Motif probes show that functional groups including aromatic rings and halogens are explicitly encoded and linearly decodable from the internal embeddings. Together, these results expose the chemical logic inside SynFlowNet and provide actionable and mechanistic insight that supports transparent and controllable molecular design.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Multi-Species Bird Soundscape Generation with Acoustic Patterning and 3D Spatialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generation of dynamic, scalable multi-species bird soundscapes remains a significant challenge in computer music and algorithmic sound design. Birdsongs involve rapid frequency-modulated chirps, complex amplitude envelopes, distinctive acoustic patterns, overlapping calls, and dynamic inter-bird interactions, all of which require precise temporal and spatial control in 3D environments. Existing approaches, whether Digital Signal Processing (DSP)-based or data-driven, typically focus only on single species modeling, static call structures, or synthesis directly from recordings, and often suffer from noise, limited flexibility, or large data needs. To address these challenges, we present a novel, fully algorithm-driven framework that generates dynamic multi-species bird soundscapes using DSP-based chirp generation and 3D spatialization, without relying on recordings or training data. Our approach simulates multiple independently-moving birds per species along different moving 3D trajectories, supporting controllable chirp sequences, overlapping choruses, and realistic 3D motion in scalable soundscapes while preserving species-specific acoustic patterns. A visualization interface provides bird trajectories, spectrograms, activity timelines, and sound waves for analytical and creative purposes. Both visual and audio evaluations demonstrate the ability of the system to generate dense, immersive, and ecologically inspired soundscapes, highlighting its potential for computer music, interactive virtual environments, and computational bioacoustics research.</description>

Abstract: This chapter seeks to frame the elemental and invisible problems of AI and big data in the African context by examining digital sites and infrastructure through the lens of power and interests. It will present reflections on how these sites are using AI recommendation algorithms to recreate new digital societies in the region, how they have the potential to propagate algorithmic colonialism and negative gender norms, and what this means for the regional sustainable development agenda. The chapter proposes adopting business models that embrace response-ability and consider the existence of alternative socio-material worlds of AI. These reflections will mainly come from ongoing discussions with Kenyan social media users in this authors' user space talks, personal experiences and six months of active participant observations done by the authors.</description>

      <title>Open-weight genome language model safeguards: Assessing robustness via adversarial fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novel deep learning architectures are increasingly being applied to biological data, including genetic sequences. These models, referred to as genomic language mod- els (gLMs), have demonstrated impressive predictive and generative capabilities, raising concerns that such models may also enable misuse, for instance via the generation of genomes for human-infecting viruses. These concerns have catalyzed calls for risk mitigation measures. The de facto mitigation of choice is filtering of pretraining data (i.e., removing viral genomic sequences from training datasets) in order to limit gLM performance on virus-related tasks. However, it is not currently known how robust this approach is for securing open-source models that can be fine-tuned using sensitive pathogen data. Here, we evaluate a state-of-the-art gLM, Evo 2, and perform fine-tuning using sequences from 110 harmful human-infecting viruses to assess the rescue of misuse-relevant predictive capabilities. The fine- tuned model exhibited reduced perplexity on unseen viral sequences relative to 1) the pretrained model and 2) a version fine-tuned on bacteriophage sequences. The model fine-tuned on human-infecting viruses also identified immune escape variants from SARS-CoV-2 (achieving an AUROC of 0.6), despite having no expo- sure to SARS-CoV-2 sequences during fine-tuning. This work demonstrates that data exclusion might be circumvented by fine-tuning approaches that can, to some degree, rescue misuse-relevant capabilities of gLMs. We highlight the need for safety frameworks for gLMs and outline further work needed on evaluations and mitigation measures to enable the safe deployment of gLMs.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Dataset Watermarking for Fine-tuning Traceability of Customized Diffusion Models: A Comprehensive Benchmark and Removal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent fine-tuning techniques for diffusion models enable them to reproduce specific image sets, such as particular faces or artistic styles, but also introduce copyright and security risks. Dataset watermarking has been proposed to ensure traceability by embedding imperceptible watermarks into training images, which remain detectable in outputs even after fine-tuning. However, current methods lack a unified evaluation framework. To address this, this paper establishes a general threat model and introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing Universality, Transmissibility, and Robustness. Experiments show that existing methods perform well in universality and transmissibility, and exhibit some robustness against common image processing operations, yet still fall short under real-world threat scenarios. To reveal these vulnerabilities, the paper further proposes a practical watermark removal method that fully eliminates dataset watermarks without affecting fine-tuning, highlighting a key challenge for future research.</description>

      <title>What Drives Cross-lingual Ranking? Retrieval Approaches with Multilingual Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) enables access to multilingual knowledge but remains challenging due to disparities in resources, scripts, and weak cross-lingual semantic alignment in embedding models. Existing pipelines often rely on translation and monolingual retrieval heuristics, which add computational overhead and noise, degrading performance. This work systematically evaluates four intervention types, namely document translation, multilingual dense retrieval with pretrained encoders, contrastive learning at word, phrase, and query-document levels, and cross-encoder re-ranking, across three benchmark datasets. We find that dense retrieval models trained specifically for CLIR consistently outperform lexical matching methods and derive little benefit from document translation. Contrastive learning mitigates language biases and yields substantial improvements for encoders with weak initial alignment, and re-ranking can be effective, but depends on the quality of the cross-encoder training data. Although high-resource languages still dominate overall performance, gains over lexical and document-translated baselines are most pronounced for low-resource and cross-script pairs. These findings indicate that cross-lingual search systems should prioritise semantic multilingual embeddings and targeted learning-based alignment over translation-based pipelines, particularly for cross-script and under-resourced languages.</description>

      <title>Generative Query Expansion with Multilingual LLMs for Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Query expansion is the reformulation of a user query by adding semantically related information, and is an essential component of monolingual and cross-lingual information retrieval used to ensure that relevant documents are not missed. Recently, multilingual large language models (mLLMs) have shifted query expansion from semantic augmentation with synonyms and related words to pseudo-document generation. Pseudo-documents both introduce additional relevant terms and bridge the gap between short queries and long documents, which is particularly beneficial in dense retrieval. This study evaluates recent mLLMs and fine-tuned variants across several generative expansion strategies to identify factors that drive cross-lingual retrieval performance. Results show that query length largely determines which prompting technique is effective, and that more elaborate prompts often do not yield further gains. Substantial linguistic disparities persist: cross-lingual query expansion can produce the largest improvements for languages with the weakest baselines, yet retrieval is especially poor between languages written in different scripts. Fine-tuning is found to lead to performance gains only when the training and test data are of similar format. These outcomes underline the need for more balanced multilingual and cross-lingual training and evaluation resources.</description>

      <title>Explicit Tonal Tension Conditioning via Dual-Level Beam Search for Symbolic Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art symbolic music generation models have recently achieved remarkable output quality, yet explicit control over compositional features, such as tonal tension, remains challenging. We propose a novel approach that integrates a computational tonal tension model, based on tonal interval vector analysis, into a Transformer framework. Our method employs a two-level beam search strategy during inference. At the token level, generated candidates are re-ranked using model probability and diversity metrics to maintain overall quality. At the bar level, a tension-based re-ranking is applied to ensure that the generated music aligns with a desired tension curve. Objective evaluations indicate that our approach effectively modulates tonal tension, and subjective listening tests confirm that the system produces outputs that align with the target tension. These results demonstrate that explicit tension conditioning through a dual-level beam search provides a powerful and intuitive tool to guide AI-generated music. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that our method can generate multiple distinct musical interpretations under the same tension condition.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMs for reward function design in reinforcement learning control tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenge of designing effective reward functions in reinforcement learning (RL) represents a significant bottleneck, often requiring extensive human expertise and being time-consuming. Previous work and recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automating the generation of reward functions. However, existing methodologies often require preliminary evaluation metrics, human-engineered feedback for the refinement process, or the use of environmental source code as context. To address these limitations, this paper introduces LEARN-Opt (LLM-based Evaluator and Analyzer for Reward functioN Optimization). This LLM-based, fully autonomous, and model-agnostic framework eliminates the need for preliminary metrics and environmental source code as context to generate, execute, and evaluate reward function candidates from textual descriptions of systems and task objectives. LEARN-Opt's main contribution lies in its ability to autonomously derive performance metrics directly from the system description and the task objective, enabling unsupervised evaluation and selection of reward functions. Our experiments indicate that LEARN-Opt achieves performance comparable to or better to that of state-of-the-art methods, such as EUREKA, while requiring less prior knowledge. We find that automated reward design is a high-variance problem, where the average-case candidate fails, requiring a multi-run approach to find the best candidates. Finally, we show that LEARN-Opt can unlock the potential of low-cost LLMs to find high-performing candidates that are comparable to, or even better than, those of larger models. This demonstrated performance affirms its potential to generate high-quality reward functions without requiring any preliminary human-defined metrics, thereby reducing engineering overhead and enhancing generalizability.</description>

      <title>DeCo: Frequency-Decoupled Pixel Diffusion for End-to-End Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pixel diffusion aims to generate images directly in pixel space in an end-to-end fashion. This approach avoids the limitations of VAE in the two-stage latent diffusion, offering higher model capacity. Existing pixel diffusion models suffer from slow training and inference, as they usually model both high-frequency signals and low-frequency semantics within a single diffusion transformer (DiT). To pursue a more efficient pixel diffusion paradigm, we propose the frequency-DeCoupled pixel diffusion framework. With the intuition to decouple the generation of high and low frequency components, we leverage a lightweight pixel decoder to generate high-frequency details conditioned on semantic guidance from the DiT. This thus frees the DiT to specialize in modeling low-frequency semantics. In addition, we introduce a frequency-aware flow-matching loss that emphasizes visually salient frequencies while suppressing insignificant ones. Extensive experiments show that DeCo achieves superior performance among pixel diffusion models, attaining FID of 1.62 (256x256) and 2.22 (512x512) on ImageNet, closing the gap with latent diffusion methods. Furthermore, our pretrained text-to-image model achieves a leading overall score of 0.86 on GenEval in system-level comparison.

      <title>An Anatomy Aware Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Lung Cancer Tumor Stage Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate lung cancer tumor staging is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, it remains challenging for end-to-end deep learning approaches, as such approaches often overlook spatial and anatomical information that are central to the tumor-node-metastasis system. The tumor stage depends on multiple quantitative criteria, including the tumor size and its proximity to the nearest anatomical structures, and small variations can alter the staging outcome. We propose a medically grounded hybrid pipeline that performs staging by explicitly measuring the tumor's size and distance properties rather than treating it as a pure image classification task. Our method employs specialized encoder-decoder networks to precisely segment the lung and adjacent anatomy, including the lobes, tumor, mediastinum, and diaphragm. Subsequently, we extract the necessary tumor properties, i.e. measure the largest tumor dimension and calculate the distance between the tumor and neighboring anatomical structures by a quantitative analysis of the segmentation masks. Finally, we apply rule-based tumor staging aligned with the medical guidelines. This novel framework has been evaluated on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional deep learning models, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 91.36%. We report the per-stage F1-scores of 0.93 (T1), 0.89 (T2), 0.96 (T3), and 0.90 (T4), a critical evaluation aspect often omitted in prior literature. To our knowledge, this is the first study that embeds explicit clinical context into tumor stage classification. Unlike standard convolutional neural networks that operate in an uninterpretable "black box" manner, our method offers both state-of-the-art performance and transparent decision support.</description>

      <title>Predicting partially observable dynamical systems via diffusion models with a multiscale inference scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional diffusion models provide a natural framework for probabilistic prediction of dynamical systems and have been successfully applied to fluid dynamics and weather prediction. However, in many settings, the available information at a given time represents only a small fraction of what is needed to predict future states, either due to measurement uncertainty or because only a small fraction of the state can be observed. This is true for example in solar physics, where we can observe the Sun's surface and atmosphere, but its evolution is driven by internal processes for which we lack direct measurements. In this paper, we tackle the probabilistic prediction of partially observable, long-memory dynamical systems, with applications to solar dynamics and the evolution of active regions. We show that standard inference schemes, such as autoregressive rollouts, fail to capture long-range dependencies in the data, largely because they do not integrate past information effectively. To overcome this, we propose a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored to physical processes. Our method generates trajectories that are temporally fine-grained near the present and coarser as we move farther away, which enables capturing long-range temporal dependencies without increasing computational cost. When integrated into a diffusion model, we show that our inference scheme significantly reduces the bias of the predicted distributions and improves rollout stability.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Object Tracking with On-Device Deep Learning for Adaptive Beamforming in Dynamic Acoustic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in object tracking and acoustic beamforming are driving new capabilities in surveillance, human-computer interaction, and robotics. This work presents an embedded system that integrates deep learning-based tracking with beamforming to achieve precise sound source localization and directional audio capture in dynamic environments. The approach combines single-camera depth estimation and stereo vision to enable accurate 3D localization of moving objects. A planar concentric circular microphone array constructed with MEMS microphones provides a compact, energy-efficient platform supporting 2D beam steering across azimuth and elevation. Real-time tracking outputs continuously adapt the array's focus, synchronizing the acoustic response with the target's position. By uniting learned spatial awareness with dynamic steering, the system maintains robust performance in the presence of multiple or moving sources. Experimental evaluation demonstrates significant gains in signal-to-interference ratio, making the design well-suited for teleconferencing, smart home devices, and assistive technologies.</description>

      <title>DR Tulu: Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics for Deep Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep research models perform multi-step research to produce long-form, well-attributed answers. However, most open deep research models are trained on easily verifiable short-form QA tasks via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which does not extend to realistic long-form tasks. We address this with Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics (RLER), in which we construct and maintain rubrics that co-evolve with the policy model during training; this allows the rubrics to incorporate information that the model has newly explored and to provide discriminative, on-policy feedback. Using RLER, we develop Deep Research Tulu (DR Tulu-8B), the first open model that is directly trained for open-ended, long-form deep research. Across four long-form deep research benchmarks in science, healthcare and general domains, DR Tulu substantially outperforms existing open deep research models, and matches or exceeds proprietary deep research systems, while being significantly smaller and cheaper per query. To facilitate future research, we release all data, models, and code, including our new MCP-based agent infrastructure for deep research systems.</description>

      <title>In-Video Instructions: Visual Signals as Generative Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale video generative models have recently demonstrated strong visual capabilities, enabling the prediction of future frames that adhere to the logical and physical cues in the current observation. In this work, we investigate whether such capabilities can be harnessed for controllable image-to-video generation by interpreting visual signals embedded within the frames as instructions, a paradigm we term In-Video Instruction. In contrast to prompt-based control, which provides textual descriptions that are inherently global and coarse, In-Video Instruction encodes user guidance directly into the visual domain through elements such as overlaid text, arrows, or trajectories. This enables explicit, spatial-aware, and unambiguous correspondences between visual subjects and their intended actions by assigning distinct instructions to different objects. Extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art generators, including Veo 3.1, Kling 2.5, and Wan 2.2, show that video models can reliably interpret and execute such visually embedded instructions, particularly in complex multi-object scenarios.</description>

      <title>UniGame: Turning a Unified Multimodal Model Into Its Own Adversary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have shown impressive performance in both understanding and generation with a single architecture. However, UMMs still exhibit a fundamental inconsistency: understanding favors compact embeddings, whereas generation favors reconstruction-rich representations. This structural trade-off produces misaligned decision boundaries, degraded cross-modal coherence, and heightened vulnerability under distributional and adversarial shifts. In this paper, we present UniGame, a self-adversarial post-training framework that directly targets the inconsistencies. By applying a lightweight perturber at the shared token interface, UniGame enables the generation branch to actively seek and challenge fragile understanding, turning the model itself into its own adversary. Experiments demonstrate that UniGame significantly improves the consistency (+4.6%). Moreover, it also achieves substantial improvements in understanding (+3.6%), generation (+0.02), out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness (+4.8% and +6.2% on NaturalBench and AdVQA). The framework is architecture-agnostic, introduces less than 1% additional parameters, and is complementary to existing post-training methods. These results position adversarial self-play as a general and effective principle for enhancing the coherence, stability, and unified competence of future multimodal foundation models.

      <title>Be My Eyes: Extending Large Language Models to New Modalities Through Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in challenging, knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks. However, extending LLMs to perceive and reason over a new modality (e.g., vision), often requires costly development of large-scale vision language models (VLMs) with LLMs as backbones. Smaller VLMs are more efficient and adaptable but often lack the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs. In this work, we propose BeMyEyes, a modular, multi-agent framework for extending LLMs to multimodal reasoning by orchestrating collaboration between efficient, adaptable VLMs as perceivers and powerful LLMs as reasoners through conversations. We then introduce a data synthesis and supervised fine-tuning pipeline to train the perceiver agent to effectively collaborate with the reasoner agent. By combining the complementary strengths of perception and reasoning agents, BeMyEyes avoids the need for training large-scale multimodal models, preserves the generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and allows flexible extension to new domains and modalities. Experiments show that our framework unlocks the multimodal reasoning capabilities for LLMs, enabling a lightweight and fully open-source solution, i.e. equipping text-only DeepSeek-R1 with Qwen2.5-VL-7B perceiver, to outperform large-scale proprietary VLMs such as GPT-4o on a wide range of knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, modularity, and scalability of our multi-agent approach for building future multimodal reasoning systems.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Visual-Thought: Teaching VLMs to See and Think Better with Continuous Visual Tokens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at reasoning in linguistic space but struggle with perceptual understanding that requires dense visual perception, e.g., spatial reasoning and geometric awareness. This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capture dense visual information across spatial dimensions. We introduce Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT), a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also through continuous visual tokens-compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens, COVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. During training, the VLM with COVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (e.g., depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating COVT into strong VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence.</description>

      <title>SLMFix: Leveraging Small Language Models for Error Fixing with Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown very impressive capabilities in code generation across many programming languages. However, even state-of-the-art LLMs generate programs that contains syntactic errors and fail to complete the given tasks, especially for low-resource programming languages (LRPLs). In addition, high training cost makes finetuning LLMs unaffordable with constrained computational resources, further undermining the effectiveness of LLMs for code generation. In this work, we propose SLMFix, a novel code generation pipeline that leverages a small language model (SLM) finetuned using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to fix syntactic errors in LLM-generated programs to improve the quality of LLM-generated programs for domain-specific languages (DSLs). In specific, we applied RL on the SLM for the program repair task using a reward calculated using both a static validator and a static semantic similarity metric. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach across multiple DSLs, achieving more than 95% pass rate on the static validator. Notably, SLMFix brings substantial improvement to the base model and outperforms supervised finetuning approach even for 7B models on a LRPL, showing the potential of our approach as an alternative to traditional finetuning approaches.</description>

Abstract: We present Genie-CAT, a tool-augmented large-language-model (LLM) system designed to accelerate scientific hypothesis generation in protein design. Using metalloproteins (e.g., ferredoxins) as a case study, Genie-CAT integrates four capabilities -- literature-grounded reasoning through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), structural parsing of Protein Data Bank files, electrostatic potential calculations, and machine-learning prediction of redox properties -- into a unified agentic workflow. By coupling natural-language reasoning with data-driven and physics-based computation, the system generates mechanistically interpretable, testable hypotheses linking sequence, structure, and function. In proof-of-concept demonstrations, Genie-CAT autonomously identifies residue-level modifications near [Fe--S] clusters that affect redox tuning, reproducing expert-derived hypotheses in a fraction of the time. The framework highlights how AI agents combining language models with domain-specific tools can bridge symbolic reasoning and numerical simulation, transforming LLMs from conversational assistants into partners for computational discovery.</description>

      <title>Prompt Less, Smile More: MTP with Semantic Engineering in Lieu of Prompt Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-Integrated programming is emerging as a foundational paradigm for building intelligent systems with large language models (LLMs). Recent approaches such as Meaning Typed Programming (MTP) automate prompt generation by leveraging the semantics already present in code. However, many real-world applications depend on contextual cues, developer intent, and domain-specific reasoning that extend beyond what static code semantics alone can express. To address this limitation, we introduce Semantic Engineering, a lightweight method for enriching program semantics so that LLM-based systems can more accurately reflect developer intent without requiring full manual prompt design. We present Semantic Context Annotations (SemTexts), a language-level mechanism that allows developers to embed natural-language context directly into program constructs. Integrated into the Jac programming language, Semantic Engineering extends MTP to incorporate these enriched semantics during prompt generation. We further introduce a benchmark suite designed to reflect realistic AI-Integrated application scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Semantic Engineering substantially improves prompt fidelity, achieving performance comparable to Prompt Engineering while requiring significantly less developer effort.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Horizons in Action Chunking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown remarkable capabilities in robotic manipulation, but their performance is sensitive to the $\textbf{action chunk length}$ used during training, termed $\textbf{horizon}$. Our empirical study reveals an inherent trade-off: longer horizons provide stronger global foresight but degrade fine-grained accuracy, while shorter ones sharpen local control yet struggle on long-term tasks, implying fixed choice of single horizons being suboptimal. To mitigate the trade-off, we propose a $\textbf{mixture of horizons (MoH)}$ strategy. MoH rearranges the action chunk into several segments with different horizons, processes them in parallel with a shared action transformer, and fuses outputs with a light linear gate. It has three appealing benefits. 1) MoH exploits long-term foresight and short-term precision jointly within a single model, improving both performance and generalizability to complex tasks. 2) MoH is plug-and-play for full-attention action modules with minimal training or inference overhead. 3) MoH enables dynamic inference with adaptive horizons, which selects stable actions through cross-horizon consensus, achieving 2.5$\times$ higher throughput than baselines while preserving superior performance. Extensive experiments over flow-based policies $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$, and one-step regression policy $\pi_{\text{reg}}$ demonstrate that MoH yields consistent and significant gains on both simulations and real-world tasks. Notably, under mixed-task setting, $\pi_{0.5}$ with MoH reaches a new state-of-the-art with 99$\%$ average success rate on LIBERO after only $30k$ training iterations.

      <title>VDC-Agent: When Video Detailed Captioners Evolve Themselves via Agentic Self-Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present VDC-Agent, a self-evolving framework for Video Detailed Captioning that requires neither human annotations nor larger teacher models. The agent forms a closed loop of caption generation, principle-guided scoring (score and textual suggestions), and prompt refinement. When caption quality regresses, a self-reflection path leverages the previous chain-of-thought to amend the update. Running this process on unlabeled videos produces trajectories of (caption, score) pairs. We convert the trajectories into preference tuples and filter out samples with JSON parsing errors, resulting in VDC-Agent-19K, which contains 18,886 automatically constructed pairs. We then fine-tune the base MLLM on this dataset using an easy-to-hard curriculum direct preference optimization. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, our VDC-Agent-7B attains state-of-the-art performance on the VDC benchmark with 49.08% average accuracy and 2.50 score, surpassing specialized video captioners and improving over the base model by +5.13% accuracy and +0.27 score at similar inference cost.</description>

      <title>The Challenge of Using LLMs to Simulate Human Behavior: A Causal Inference Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential to simulate human behavior. We identify a fundamental challenge in using them to simulate experiments: when LLM-simulated subjects are blind to the experimental design (as is standard practice with human subjects), variations in treatment systematically affect unspecified variables that should remain constant, violating the unconfoundedness assumption. Using demand estimation as a context and an actual experiment with 40 different products as a benchmark, we show this can lead to implausible results. While confounding may in principle be addressed by controlling for covariates, this can compromise ecological validity in the context of LLM simulations: controlled covariates become artificially salient in the simulated decision process. We show formally that confoundness stems from ambiguous prompting strategies. Therefore, it can be addressed by developing unambiguous prompting strategies through unblinding, i.e., revealing the experiment design in LLM simulations. Our empirical results show that this strategy consistently enhances model performance across all tested models, including both out-of-box reasoning and non-reasoning models. We also show that it is a technique that complements fine-tuning: while fine-tuning can improve simulation performance, an unambiguous prompting strategy makes the predictions robust to the inclusion of irrelevant data in the fine-tuning process.</description>

      <title>Gradient Propagation in Retrosynthetic Space: An Efficient Framework for Synthesis Plan Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis, which aims to identify viable synthetic pathways for target molecules by decomposing them into simpler precursors, is often treated as a search problem. However, its complexity arises from multi-branched tree-structured pathways rather than linear paths. Some algorithms have been successfully applied in this task, but they either overlook the uncertainties inherent in chemical space or face limitations in practical application scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel gradient-propagation-based algorithmic framework for retrosynthetic route exploration. The proposed framework obtains the contributions of different nodes to the target molecule's success probability through gradient propagation and then guides the algorithm to greedily select the node with the highest contribution for expansion, thereby conducting efficient search in the chemical space. Experimental validations demonstrate that our algorithm achieves broad applicability across diverse molecular targets and exhibits superior computational efficiency compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Developing an Algorithm Selector for Green Configuration in Scheduling Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) is central to operations research, primarily optimizing energy efficiency due to its profound environmental and economic implications. Efficient scheduling enhances production metrics and mitigates energy consumption, thus effectively balancing productivity and sustainability objectives. Given the intricate and diverse nature of JSP instances, along with the array of algorithms developed to tackle these challenges, an intelligent algorithm selection tool becomes paramount. This paper introduces a framework designed to identify key problem features that characterize its complexity and guide the selection of suitable algorithms. Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly XGBoost, the framework recommends optimal solvers such as GUROBI, CPLEX, and GECODE for efficient JSP scheduling. GUROBI excels with smaller instances, while GECODE demonstrates robust scalability for complex scenarios. The proposed algorithm selector achieves an accuracy of 84.51\% in recommending the best algorithm for solving new JSP instances, highlighting its efficacy in algorithm selection. By refining feature extraction methodologies, the framework aims to broaden its applicability across diverse JSP scenarios, thereby advancing efficiency and sustainability in manufacturing logistics.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Evaluation of Large Language Models on Mental Illnesses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various domains, including healthcare, with significant potential to transform mental health applications by enabling scalable and accessible solutions. This study aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of 33 LLMs, ranging from 2 billion to 405+ billion parameters, in performing key mental health tasks using social media data across six datasets. To our knowledge, this represents the largest-scale systematic evaluation of modern LLMs for mental health applications. Models such as GPT-4, Llama 3, Claude, Gemma, Gemini, and Phi-3 were assessed for their zero-shot (ZS) and few-shot (FS) capabilities across three tasks: binary disorder detection, disorder severity evaluation, and psychiatric knowledge assessment. Key findings revealed that models like GPT-4 and Llama 3 exhibited superior performance in binary disorder detection, achieving accuracies up to 85% on certain datasets, while FS learning notably enhanced disorder severity evaluations, reducing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 1.3 points for the Phi-3-mini model. Recent models, such as Llama 3.1 405b, demonstrated exceptional psychiatric knowledge assessment accuracy at 91.2%, while prompt engineering played a crucial role in improving performance across tasks. However, the ethical constraints imposed by many LLM providers limit their ability to respond to sensitive queries, hampering comprehensive performance evaluations. This work highlights both the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in mental health contexts, offering valuable insights for future applications in psychiatry.</description>

      <title>Functional Classification of Spiking Signal Data Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human brain neuron activities are incredibly significant nowadays. Neuronal behavior is assessed by analyzing signal data such as electroencephalography (EEG), which can offer scientists valuable information about diseases and human-computer interaction. One of the difficulties researchers confront while evaluating these signals is the existence of large volumes of spike data. Spikes are some considerable parts of signal data that can happen as a consequence of vital biomarkers or physical issues such as electrode movements. Hence, distinguishing types of spikes is important. From this spot, the spike classification concept commences. Previously, researchers classified spikes manually. The manual classification was not precise enough as it involves extensive analysis. Consequently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was introduced into neuroscience to assist clinicians in classifying spikes correctly. This review discusses the importance and use of AI in spike classification, focusing on the recognition of neural activity noises. The task is divided into three main components: preprocessing, classification, and evaluation. Existing methods are introduced and their importance is determined. The review also highlights the need for more efficient algorithms. The primary goal is to provide a perspective on spike classification for future research and provide a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies and issues involved. The review organizes materials in the spike classification field for future studies. In this work, numerous studies were extracted from different databases. The PRISMA-related research guidelines were then used to choose papers. Then, research studies based on spike classification using machine learning and deep learning approaches with effective preprocessing were selected.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Accurate Graph Reasoning with LLM-based Multi-Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling complex graph reasoning tasks. However, due to the intricacies of graph structures and the inherent limitations of LLMs in handling long text, current approaches often fail to deliver satisfactory accuracy, even on small-scale graphs and simple tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce GraphAgent-Reasoner, a fine-tuning-free framework that utilizes a multi-agent collaboration strategy for explicit and precise graph reasoning. Inspired by distributed graph computation theory, our framework decomposes graph problems into smaller, node-centric tasks that are distributed among multiple agents. The agents collaborate to solve the overall problem, significantly reducing the amount of information and complexity handled by a single LLM, thus enhancing the accuracy of graph reasoning. By simply increasing the number of agents, GraphAgent-Reasoner can efficiently scale to accommodate larger graphs with over 1,000 nodes. Evaluated on the GraphInstruct dataset, our framework demonstrates near-perfect accuracy on polynomial-time graph reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming the best available models, both closed-source and fine-tuned open-source variants. Our framework also demonstrates the capability to handle real-world graph reasoning applications such as webpage importance analysis.</description>

      <title>Scaling Capability in Token Space: An Analysis of Large Vision Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18387v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated predictable scaling behaviors with respect to model parameters and training data. This study investigates whether a similar scaling relationship exist for vision-language models with respect to the number of vision tokens. A mathematical framework is developed to characterize a relationship between vision token number and the expected divergence of distance between vision-referencing sequences. The theoretical analysis reveals two distinct scaling regimes: sublinear scaling for less vision tokens and linear scaling for more vision tokens. This aligns with model performance relationships of the form \(S(n) \approx c / n^{\alpha(n)}\), where the scaling exponent relates to the correlation structure between vision token representations. Empirical validations across multiple vision-language benchmarks show that model performance matches the prediction from scaling relationship. The findings contribute to understanding vision token scaling in transformers through a theoretical framework that complements empirical observations.</description>

      <title>A Roadmap to Guide the Integration of LLMs in Hierarchical Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) are fostering their integration into several reasoning-related fields, including Automated Planning (AP). However, their integration into Hierarchical Planning (HP), a subfield of AP that leverages hierarchical knowledge to enhance planning performance, remains largely unexplored. In this preliminary work, we propose a roadmap to address this gap and harness the potential of LLMs for HP. To this end, we present a taxonomy of integration methods, exploring how LLMs can be utilized within the HP life cycle. Additionally, we provide a benchmark with a standardized dataset for evaluating the performance of future LLM-based HP approaches, and present initial results for a state-of-the-art HP planner and LLM planner. As expected, the latter exhibits limited performance (3\% correct plans, and none with a correct hierarchical decomposition) but serves as a valuable baseline for future approaches.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Free Energy Principle for Decision-Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their groundbreaking performance, autonomous agents can misbehave when training and environmental conditions become inconsistent, with minor mismatches leading to undesirable behaviors or even catastrophic failures. Robustness towards these training-environment ambiguities is a core requirement for intelligent agents and its fulfillment is a long-standing challenge towards their real-world deployments. Here, we introduce a Distributionally Robust Free Energy model (DR-FREE) that instills this core property by design. Combining a robust extension of the free energy principle with a resolution engine, DR-FREE wires robustness into the agent decision-making mechanisms. Across benchmark experiments, DR-FREE enables the agents to complete the task even when, in contrast, state-of-the-art models fail. This milestone may inspire both deployments in multi-agent settings and, at a perhaps deeper level, the quest for an explanation of how natural agents -- with little or no training -- survive in capricious environments.</description>

      <title>Agentic Large Language Models, a survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: There is great interest in agentic LLMs, large language models that act as agents.
  Objectives: We review the growing body of work in this area and provide a research agenda.
  Methods: Agentic LLMs are LLMs that (1) reason, (2) act, and (3) interact. We organize the literature according to these three categories.
  Results: The research in the first category focuses on reasoning, reflection, and retrieval, aiming to improve decision making; the second category focuses on action models, robots, and tools, aiming for agents that act as useful assistants; the third category focuses on multi-agent systems, aiming for collaborative task solving and simulating interaction to study emergent social behavior. We find that works mutually benefit from results in other categories: retrieval enables tool use, reflection improves multi-agent collaboration, and reasoning benefits all categories.
  Conclusions: We discuss applications of agentic LLMs and provide an agenda for further research. Important applications are in medical diagnosis, logistics and financial market analysis. Meanwhile, self-reflective agents playing roles and interacting with one another augment the process of scientific research itself. Further, agentic LLMs provide a solution for the problem of LLMs running out of training data: inference-time behavior generates new training states, such that LLMs can keep learning without needing ever larger datasets. We note that there is risk associated with LLM assistants taking action in the real world-safety, liability and security are open problems-while agentic LLMs are also likely to benefit society.</description>

      <title>Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in LLMs Beyond the Base Model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13837v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly on mathematics and programming tasks. Similar to how traditional RL helps agents explore and learn new strategies, RLVR is believed to enable LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities beyond those of the corresponding base models. In this study we critically examine the current state of RLVR by systematically probing the reasoning capability boundaries of RLVR-trained LLMs across various model families, RL algorithms, and math, coding, and visual reasoning benchmarks, using pass@k at large k values as the evaluation metric. Surprisingly, we find that the current training setup does not elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RLVR-trained models outperform their base models at small k (e.g., k = 1), the base models achieve a higher pass@k score when k is large. Coverage and perplexity analyses show that the observed reasoning abilities originate from and are bounded by the base model. Treating the base model as an upper bound, our quantitative analysis shows that six popular RLVR algorithms perform similarly and remain far from optimal in leveraging the potential of the base model. By contrast, we find that distillation can introduce new reasoning patterns from the teacher and genuinely expand the model's reasoning capabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that current RLVR methods have not yet realized the potential of RL to elicit truly novel reasoning abilities in LLMs. This highlights the need for improved RL paradigms, such as continual scaling and multi-turn agent-environment interaction, to unlock this potential.</description>

      <title>Text-to-Decision Agent: Offline Meta-Reinforcement Learning from Natural Language Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15046v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offline meta-RL usually tackles generalization by inferring task beliefs from high-quality samples or warmup explorations. The restricted form limits their generality and usability since these supervision signals are expensive and even infeasible to acquire in advance for unseen tasks. Learning directly from the raw text about decision tasks is a promising alternative to leverage a much broader source of supervision. In the paper, we propose \textbf{T}ext-to-\textbf{D}ecision \textbf{A}gent (\textbf{T2DA}), a simple and scalable framework that supervises offline meta-RL with natural language. We first introduce a generalized world model to encode multi-task decision data into a dynamics-aware embedding space. Then, inspired by CLIP, we predict which textual description goes with which decision embedding, effectively bridging their semantic gap via contrastive language-decision pre-training and aligning the text embeddings to comprehend the environment dynamics. After training the text-conditioned generalist policy, the agent can directly realize zero-shot text-to-decision generation in response to language instructions. Comprehensive experiments on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks show that T2DA facilitates high-capacity zero-shot generalization and outperforms various types of baselines.

      <title>Preprint: Exploring Inevitable Waypoints for Unsolvability Explanation in Hybrid Planning Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explaining unsolvability of planning problems is of significant research interest in Explainable AI Planning. AI planning literature has reported several research efforts on generating explanations of solutions to planning problems. However, explaining the unsolvability of planning problems remains a largely open and understudied problem. A widely practiced approach to plan generation and automated problem solving, in general, is to decompose tasks into sub-problems that help progressively converge towards the goal. In this paper, we propose to adopt the same philosophy of sub-problem identification as a mechanism for analyzing and explaining unsolvability of planning problems in hybrid systems. In particular, for a given unsolvable planning problem, we propose to identify common waypoints, which are universal obstacles to plan existence; in other words, they appear on every plan from the source to the planning goal. This work envisions such waypoints as sub-problems of the planning problem and the unreachability of any of these waypoints as an explanation for the unsolvability of the original planning problem. We propose a novel method of waypoint identification by casting the problem as an instance of the longest common subsequence problem, a widely popular problem in computer science, typically considered as an illustrative example for the dynamic programming paradigm. Once the waypoints are identified, we perform symbolic reachability analysis on them to identify the earliest unreachable waypoint and report it as the explanation of unsolvability. We present experimental results on unsolvable planning problems in hybrid domains.</description>

      <title>MoveGPT: Scaling Mobility Foundation Models with Spatially-Aware Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of foundation models in language has inspired a new wave of general-purpose models for human mobility. However, existing approaches struggle to scale effectively due to two fundamental limitations: a failure to use meaningful basic units to represent movement, and an inability to capture the vast diversity of patterns found in large-scale data. In this work, we develop MoveGPT, a large-scale foundation model specifically architected to overcome these barriers. MoveGPT is built upon two key innovations: (1) a unified location encoder that maps geographically disjoint locations into a shared semantic space, enabling pre-training on a global scale; and (2) a Spatially-Aware Mixture-of-Experts Transformer that develops specialized experts to efficiently capture diverse mobility patterns. Pre-trained on billion-scale datasets, MoveGPT establishes a new state-of-the-art across a wide range of downstream tasks, achieving performance gains of up to 35% on average. It also demonstrates strong generalization capabilities to unseen cities. Crucially, our work provides empirical evidence of scaling ability in human mobility, validating a clear path toward building increasingly capable foundation models in this domain.</description>

      <title>TRAP: Targeted Redirecting of Agentic Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous agentic AI systems powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are rapidly advancing toward real-world deployment, yet their cross-modal reasoning capabilities introduce new attack surfaces for adversarial manipulation that exploit semantic reasoning across modalities. Existing adversarial attacks typically rely on visible pixel perturbations or require privileged model or environment access, making them impractical for stealthy, real-world exploitation. We introduce TRAP, a novel generative adversarial framework that manipulates the agent's decision-making using diffusion-based semantic injections into the vision-language embedding space. Our method combines negative prompt-based degradation with positive semantic optimization, guided by a Siamese semantic network and layout-aware spatial masking. Without requiring access to model internals, TRAP produces visually natural images yet induces consistent selection biases in agentic AI systems. We evaluate TRAP on the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset, building multi-candidate decision scenarios. Across these scenarios, TRAP consistently induces decision-level preference redirection on leading models, including LLaVA-34B, Gemma3, GPT-4o, and Mistral-3.2, significantly outperforming existing baselines such as SPSA, Bandit, and standard diffusion approaches. These findings expose a critical, generalized vulnerability: autonomous agents can be consistently misled through visually subtle, semantically-guided cross-modal manipulations. Overall, our results show the need for defense strategies beyond pixel-level robustness to address semantic vulnerabilities in cross-modal decision-making. The code for TRAP is accessible on GitHub at https://github.com/uiuc-focal-lab/TRAP.</description>

      <title>WorldLLM: Improving LLMs' world modeling using curiosity-driven theory-making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess general world knowledge but often struggle to generate precise predictions in structured, domain-specific contexts such as simulations. These limitations arise from their inability to ground their broad, unstructured understanding in specific environments. To address this, we present WorldLLM, a framework that enhances LLM-based world modeling by combining Bayesian inference and autonomous active exploration with reinforcement learning. WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language hypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined through a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the proposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected using a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the environment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based predictive model using the current hypotheses. By alternating between refining hypotheses and collecting new evidence, our framework autonomously drives continual improvement of the predictions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldLLM in a textual game environment that requires agents to manipulate and combine objects. The framework not only enhances predictive accuracy, but also generates human-interpretable theories of environment dynamics.</description>

      <title>Graph of Verification: Structured Verification of LLM Reasoning with Directed Acyclic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verifying the complex and multi-step reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical challenge, as holistic methods often overlook localized flaws. Step-by-step validation is a promising alternative, yet existing methods are often rigid. They struggle to adapt to diverse reasoning structures, from formal proofs to informal natural language narratives. To address this adaptability gap, we propose the Graph of Verification (GoV), a novel framework for adaptable and multi-granular verification. GoV's core innovation is its flexible "node block" architecture. This mechanism allows GoV to adaptively adjust its verification granularity--from atomic steps for formal tasks to entire paragraphs for natural language--to match the native structure of the reasoning process. This flexibility allows GoV to resolve the fundamental trade-off between verification precision and robustness. Experiments on both well-structured and loosely-structured benchmarks demonstrate GoV's versatility. The results show that GoV's adaptive approach significantly outperforms both holistic baselines and other state-of-the-art decomposition-based methods, establishing a new standard for training-free reasoning verification.</description>

      <title>AlphaBeta is not as good as you think: a simple random games model for a better analysis of deterministic game-solving algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deterministic game-solving algorithms are conventionally analyzed in the light of their average-case complexity against a distribution of random game-trees, where leaf values are independently sampled from a fixed distribution. This simplified model enables uncluttered mathematical analysis, revealing two key properties: root value distributions asymptotically collapse to a single fixed value for finite-valued trees, and all reasonable algorithms achieve global optimality. However, these findings are artifacts of the model's design: its long criticized independence assumption strips games of structural complexity, producing trivial instances where no algorithm faces meaningful challenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a simple probabilistic model that incrementally constructs game-trees using a fixed level-wise conditional distribution. By enforcing ancestor dependencies, a critical structural feature of real-world games, our framework generates problems with adjustable difficulty while retaining some form of analytical tractability. For several algorithms, including AlphaBeta and Scout, we derive recursive formulas characterizing their average-case complexities under this model. These allow us to rigorously compare algorithms on deep game-trees, where Monte-Carlo simulations are no longer feasible. While asymptotically, all algorithms seem to converge to identical branching factor (a result analogous to that of independence-based models), deep finite trees reveal stark differences: AlphaBeta incurs a significantly larger constant multiplicative factor compared to algorithms like Scout, leading to a substantial practical slowdown. Our framework sheds new light on classical game-solving algorithms, offering rigorous evidence and analytical tools to advance the understanding of these methods under a richer, more challenging, and yet tractable model.</description>

      <title>AI and the Net-Zero Journey: Energy Demand, Emissions, and the Potential for Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thanks to the availability of massive amounts of data, computing resources, and advanced algorithms, AI has entered nearly every sector. This has sparked significant investment and interest, particularly in building data centers with the necessary hardware and software to develop and operate AI models and AI-based workflows. In this technical review article, we present energy consumption scenarios of data centers and impact on GHG emissions, considering both near-term projections (up to 2030) and long-term outlook (2035 and beyond). We address the quintessential question of whether AI will have a net positive, neutral, or negative impact on CO2 emissions by 2035. Additionally, we discuss AI's potential to automate, create efficient and disruptive workflows across various fields related to energy production, supply and consumption. In the near-term scenario, the growing demand for AI will likely strain computing resources, lead to increase in electricity consumption and therefore associated CO2 emissions. This is due to the power-hungry nature of big data centers and the requirements for training and running of large and complex AI models, as well as the penetration of AI assistant search and applications for public use. However, the long-term outlook could be more promising. AI has the potential to be a game-changer in CO2 reduction. Its ability to further automate and optimize processes across industries, from energy production to logistics, could significantly decrease our carbon footprint. This positive impact is anticipated to outweigh the initial emissions bump, creating value for businesses and society in areas where traditional solutions have fallen short. In essence, AI might cause some initial growing pains for the environment, but it has the potential to support climate mitigation efforts.</description>

Abstract: Mobile health (mHealth) programs utilize automated voice messages to deliver health information, particularly targeting underserved communities, demonstrating the effectiveness of using mobile technology to disseminate crucial health information to these populations, improving health outcomes through increased awareness and behavioral change. India's Kilkari program delivers vital maternal health information via weekly voice calls to millions of mothers. However, the current random call scheduling often results in missed calls and reduced message delivery. This study presents a field trial of a collaborative bandit algorithm designed to optimize call timing by learning individual mothers' preferred call times. We deployed the algorithm with around $6500$ Kilkari participants as a pilot study, comparing its performance to the baseline random calling approach. Our results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in call pick-up rates with the bandit algorithm, indicating its potential to enhance message delivery and impact millions of mothers across India. This research highlights the efficacy of personalized scheduling in mobile health interventions and underscores the potential of machine learning to improve maternal health outreach at scale.</description>

Abstract: Identifying novel hypotheses is essential to scientific research, yet this process risks being overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of available information. Existing automated methods often struggle to generate novel and evidence-grounded hypotheses, lack robust iterative refinement and rarely undergo rigorous temporal evaluation for future discovery potential. To address this, we propose BioDisco, a multi-agent framework that draws upon language model-based reasoning and a dual-mode evidence system (biomedical knowledge graphs and automated literature retrieval) for grounded novelty, integrates an internal scoring and feedback loop for iterative refinement, and validates performance through pioneering temporal and human evaluations and a Bradley-Terry paired comparison model to provide statistically-grounded assessment. Our evaluations demonstrate superior novelty and significance over ablated configurations and generalist biomedical agents. Designed for flexibility and modularity, BioDisco allows seamless integration of custom language models or knowledge graphs, and can be run with just a few lines of code.</description>

      <title>MeteorPred: A Meteorological Multimodal Large Model and Dataset for Severe Weather Event Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timely and accurate forecasts of severe weather events are essential for early warning and for constraining downstream analysis and decision-making. Since severe weather events prediction still depends on subjective, time-consuming expert interpretation, end-to-end "AI weather station" systems are emerging but face three major challenges: (1) scarcity of severe weather event samples; (2) imperfect alignment between high-dimensional meteorological data and textual warnings; (3) current multimodal language models cannot effectively process high-dimensional meteorological inputs or capture their complex spatiotemporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we introduce MP-Bench, the first large-scale multimodal dataset for severe weather events prediction, comprising 421,363 pairs of raw multi-year meteorological data and corresponding text caption, covering a wide range of severe weather scenarios. On top of this dataset, we develop a Meteorology Multimodal Large Model (MMLM) that directly ingests 4D meteorological inputs. In addition, it is designed to accommodate the unique characteristics of 4D meteorological data flow, incorporating three plug-and-play adaptive fusion modules that enable dynamic feature extraction and integration across temporal sequences, vertical pressure layers, and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments on MP-Bench show that MMLM achieves strong performance across multiple tasks, demonstrating effective severe weather understanding and representing a key step toward automated, AI-driven severe weather events forecasting systems. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>FERA: Bridging the Semantic Gap in Foil Fencing via Kinematic Pose Recognition and Explainable Rule Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foil fencing presents a unique multimedia challenge: actions are extremely fast, interactions are subtle, and the final right-of-way decision relies on complex linguistic rules applied to visual data. We present FERA (Fencing Referee Assistant), a pose-based framework that bridges the gap between pixel-level perception and semantic rule reasoning. From monocular video, FERA extracts 2D poses, converts them into a compact 101-dimensional kinematic representation, and applies an encoder-only Transformer (FERA-MDT) to predict multi-label footwork and blade actions. Crucially, these predictions serve as semantic tokens for a downstream language model (FERA-LM) to generate explainable verdicts. Training treats left and right fencers symmetrically by creating two single-fencer sequences per clip. At inference, FERA-MDT uses dynamic temporal windowing to handle variable-length clips, and paired predictions are passed to FERA-LM, which applies encoded right-of-way rules to generate prototype decisions and short explanations. On 1,734 clips (2,386 move instances) from professional bouts, FERA-MDT reaches a macro-F1 of 0.549 under 5-fold cross-validation, outperforming a BiLSTM, TCN, and baseline Transformer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our structured outputs enable a language model to perform logical rule reasoning, effectively decoupling visual perception from rule application. FERA provides the first dataset and benchmark for this cross-modal action understanding task.</description>

      <title>Bridging LLM Planning Agents and Formal Methods: A Case Study in Plan Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for evaluating the alignment between natural language plans and their expected behavior by converting them into Kripke structures and Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) using Large Language Models (LLMs) and performing model checking. We systematically evaluate this framework on a simplified version of the PlanBench plan verification dataset and report on metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 scores. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT-5 achieves excellent classification performance (F1 score of 96.3%) while almost always producing syntactically perfect formal representations that can act as guarantees. However, the synthesis of semantically perfect formal models remains an area for future exploration.</description>

      <title>Beneficial Reasoning Behaviors in Agentic Search and Effective Post-training to Obtain Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06534</link>

Abstract: Agentic search leverages LLMs to solve complex user information needs by executing a multi-step process of planning, searching, and synthesizing information to provide answers. This paradigm introduces unique challenges for LLMs' agentic reasoning capabilities when interacting with search systems. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior patterns in agentic search by analyzing agentic search trajectories. Using this pipeline, we identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors: Information Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error Recovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior Priming to train agentic search models. It synthesizes trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into the agentic search model through SFT, followed by standard reinforcement learning. Experiments on Qwen3-1.7B and Llama3.2-3B-Instruct across three web benchmarks and seven multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that behavior priming 1) yields significant performance gains compared to training with direct RL, and 2) outperforms other SFT-then-RL baselines, such as those SFT on randomly selected trajectories or on trajectories with merely correct outcomes. Crucially, we demonstrate that the reasoning behaviors, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical factor for achieving strong performance in RL: SFT on trajectories with reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to comparable performance with SFT on those with reasoning behaviors and correct answers. Our analysis further reveals that the introduced reasoning behaviors endow models with more effective exploration (higher pass@k and entropy) and test-time scaling (longer trajectories) capabilities, providing a strong foundation for RL.

      <title>FinMR: A Knowledge-Intensive Multimodal Benchmark for Advanced Financial Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made substantial progress in recent years. However, their rigorous evaluation within specialized domains like finance is hindered by the absence of datasets characterized by professional-level knowledge intensity, detailed annotations, and advanced reasoning complexity. To address this critical gap, we introduce FinMR, a high-quality, knowledge-intensive multimodal dataset explicitly designed to evaluate expert-level financial reasoning capabilities at a professional analyst's standard. FinMR comprises over 3,200 meticulously curated and expertly annotated question-answer pairs across 15 diverse financial topics, ensuring broad domain diversity and integrating sophisticated mathematical reasoning, advanced financial knowledge, and nuanced visual interpretation tasks across multiple image types. Through comprehensive benchmarking with leading closed-source and open-source MLLMs, we highlight significant performance disparities between these models and professional financial analysts, uncovering key areas for model advancement, such as precise image analysis, accurate application of complex financial formulas, and deeper contextual financial understanding. By providing richly varied visual content and thorough explanatory annotations, FinMR establishes itself as an essential benchmark tool for assessing and advancing multimodal financial reasoning toward professional analyst-level competence.</description>

      <title>How Focused Are LLMs? A Quantitative Study via Repetitive Deterministic Prediction Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of large language models on repetitive deterministic prediction tasks and study how the sequence accuracy rate scales with output length. Each such task involves repeating the same operation n times. Examples include letter replacement in strings following a given rule, integer addition, and multiplication of string operators in many body quantum mechanics. If the model performs the task through a simple repetition algorithm, the success rate should decay exponentially with sequence length. In contrast, our experiments on leading large language models reveal a sharp double exponential drop beyond a characteristic length scale, forming an accuracy cliff that marks the transition from reliable to unstable generation. This indicates that the models fail to execute each operation independently. To explain this phenomenon, we propose a statistical physics inspired model that captures the competition between external conditioning from the prompt and internal interference among generated tokens. The model quantitatively reproduces the observed crossover and provides an interpretable link between attention induced interference and sequence level failure. Fitting the model to empirical results across multiple models and tasks yields effective parameters that characterize the intrinsic error rate and error accumulation factor for each model task pair, offering a principled framework for understanding the limits of deterministic accuracy in large language models.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs Feel? Teaching Emotion Recognition with Prompts, Retrieval, and Curriculum Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is a crucial task for understanding human emotions and enabling natural human-computer interaction. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown great potential in this field, their ability to capture the intrinsic connections between explicit and implicit emotions remains limited. We propose a novel ERC training framework, PRC-Emo, which integrates Prompt engineering, demonstration Retrieval, and Curriculum learning, with the goal of exploring whether LLMs can effectively perceive emotions in conversational contexts. Specifically, we design emotion-sensitive prompt templates based on both explicit and implicit emotional cues to better guide the model in understanding the speaker's psychological states. We construct the first dedicated demonstration retrieval repository for ERC, which includes training samples from widely used datasets, as well as high-quality dialogue examples generated by LLMs and manually verified. Moreover, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy into the LoRA fine-tuning process, incorporating weighted emotional shifts between same-speaker and different-speaker utterances to assign difficulty levels to dialogue samples, which are then organized in an easy-to-hard training sequence. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets -- IEMOCAP and MELD -- show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in improving LLM-based emotional understanding.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Vehicle Path Planning by Searching With Differentiable Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planning allows an agent to safely refine its actions before executing them in the real world. In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences. Our DSS agent optimizes its actions using gradient descent over imagined future trajectories. We show experimentally that DSS - the combination of planning gradients and stochastic search - significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.</description>

      <title>DataSage: Multi-agent Collaboration for Insight Discovery with External Knowledge Retrieval, Multi-role Debating, and Multi-path Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In today's data-driven era, fully automated end-to-end data analytics, particularly insight discovery, is critical for discovering actionable insights that assist organizations in making effective decisions. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), LLM-driven agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for automating data analysis and insight discovery. However, existing data insight agents remain limited in several key aspects, often failing to deliver satisfactory results due to: (1) insufficient utilization of domain knowledge, (2) shallow analytical depth, and (3) error-prone code generation during insight generation. To address these issues, we propose DataSage, a novel multi-agent framework that incorporates three innovative features including external knowledge retrieval to enrich the analytical context, a multi-role debating mechanism to simulate diverse analytical perspectives and deepen analytical depth, and multi-path reasoning to improve the accuracy of the generated code and insights. Extensive experiments on InsightBench demonstrate that DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels, offering an effective solution for automated data insight discovery.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization for Power Distribution System Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Restoring power distribution systems (PDS) after large-scale outages requires sequential switching operations that reconfigure feeder topology and coordinate distributed energy resources (DERs) under nonlinear constraints such as power balance, voltage limits, and thermal ratings. These challenges make conventional optimization and value-based RL approaches computationally inefficient and difficult to scale. This paper applies a Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) framework, instantiated through Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO), to enable coordinated restoration across interconnected microgrids. Each agent controls a distinct microgrid with different loads, DER capacities, and switch counts, introducing practical structural heterogeneity. Decentralized actor policies are trained with a centralized critic to compute advantage values for stable on-policy updates. A physics-informed OpenDSS environment provides full power flow feedback and enforces operational limits via differentiable penalty signals rather than invalid action masking. The total DER generation is capped at 2400 kW, and each microgrid must satisfy local supply-demand feasibility. Experiments on the IEEE 123-bus and IEEE 8500-node systems show that HAPPO achieves faster convergence, higher restored power, and smoother multi-seed training than DQN, PPO, MAES, MAGDPG, MADQN, Mean-Field RL, and QMIX. Results demonstrate that incorporating microgrid-level heterogeneity within the HARL framework yields a scalable, stable, and constraint-aware solution for complex PDS restoration.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning via Geometric Projection Reference Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into medical practice offers transformative potential, yet their real-world clinical applicability remains constrained by critical alignment issues: (1) a misalignment between static evaluation benchmarks and the dynamic cognitive demands of clinical practice, (2) challenges in adapting to continuously evolving, multi-source medical standards, and (3) the limited capacity of conventional reward models to reflect nuanced, multi-dimensional medical quality criteria. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) with GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints)-a novel alignment framework that structured medical standards into a multi-perspective matrix to guide both data generation and model optimization. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a medical standard system that embeds domain-specific guidelines throughout the training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, transitioning from rule-based or LLM-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for better evaluation performance; and (3) geometric projection reference constraints that translate clinical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and facilitating training with synthetically generated data. Extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the performance of the base Qwen-32B model, with improvements of 45% on the full subset and 85% on the hard subset. It achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source LLMs, scoring 62.7 (full) and 44.7 (hard), while also surpassing the majority of closed-source models.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Foundations for Reasoning and Their Manifestation in LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) solve complex problems yet fail on simpler variants, suggesting they achieve correct outputs through mechanisms fundamentally different from human reasoning. To understand this gap, we synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning reasoning invariants, meta-cognitive controls, representations for organizing reasoning &amp; knowledge, and transformation operations. We introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale empirical analysis of 192K traces from 18 models across text, vision, and audio, complemented by 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. We find that models under-utilize cognitive elements correlated with success, narrowing to rigid sequential processing on ill-structured problems where diverse representations and meta-cognitive monitoring are critical. Human traces show more abstraction and conceptual processing, while models default to surface-level enumeration. Meta-analysis of 1.6K LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable elements (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) but neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 66.7% on complex problems. By establishing a shared vocabulary between cognitive science and LLM research, our framework enables systematic diagnosis of reasoning failures and principled development of models that reason through robust cognitive mechanisms rather than spurious shortcuts, while providing tools to test theories of human cognition at scale.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Detect Misinformation in Scientific News Reporting?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific facts are often spun in the popular press with the intent to influence public opinion and action, as was evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Automatic detection of misinformation in the scientific domain is challenging because of the distinct styles of writing in these two media types and is still in its nascence. Most research on the validity of scientific reporting treats this problem as a claim verification challenge. In doing so, significant expert human effort is required to generate appropriate claims. Our solution bypasses this step and addresses a more real-world scenario where such explicit, labeled claims may not be available. The central research question of this paper is whether it is possible to use large language models (LLMs) to detect misinformation in scientific reporting. To this end, we first present a new labeled dataset SciNews, containing 2.4k scientific news stories drawn from trusted and untrustworthy sources, paired with related abstracts from the CORD-19 database. Our dataset includes both human-written and LLM-generated news articles, making it more comprehensive in terms of capturing the growing trend of using LLMs to generate popular press articles. Then, we identify dimensions of scientific validity in science news articles and explore how this can be integrated into the automated detection of scientific misinformation. We propose several baseline architectures using LLMs to automatically detect false representations of scientific findings in the popular press. For each of these architectures, we use several prompt engineering strategies including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting. We also test these architectures and prompting strategies on GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama2-7B, Llama2-13B.</description>

      <title>Social and Ethical Risks Posed by General-Purpose LLMs for Settling Newcomers in Canada</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-profit settlement sector in Canada supports newcomers in achieving successful integration. This sector faces increasing operational pressures amidst rising immigration targets, which highlights a need for enhanced efficiency and innovation, potentially through reliable AI solutions. The ad-hoc use of general-purpose generative AI, such as ChatGPT, might become a common practice among newcomers and service providers to address this need. However, these tools are not tailored for the settlement domain and can have detrimental implications for immigrants and refugees. We explore the risks that these tools might pose on newcomers to first, warn against the unguarded use of generative AI, and second, to incentivize further research and development in creating AI literacy programs as well as customized LLMs that are aligned with the preferences of the impacted communities. Crucially, such technologies should be designed to integrate seamlessly into the existing workflow of the settlement sector, ensuring human oversight, trustworthiness, and accountability.</description>

Abstract: Self-supervision has the potential to transform reinforcement learning (RL), paralleling the breakthroughs it has enabled in other areas of machine learning. While self-supervised learning in other domains aims to find patterns in a fixed dataset, self-supervised goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) agents discover new behaviors by learning from the goals achieved during unstructured interaction with the environment. However, these methods have failed to see similar success, both due to a lack of data from slow environment simulations as well as a lack of stable algorithms. We take a step toward addressing both of these issues by releasing a high-performance codebase and benchmark (JaxGCRL) for self-supervised GCRL, enabling researchers to train agents for millions of environment steps in minutes on a single GPU. By utilizing GPU-accelerated replay buffers, environments, and a stable contrastive RL algorithm, we reduce training time by up to $22\times$. Additionally, we assess key design choices in contrastive RL, identifying those that most effectively stabilize and enhance training performance. With this approach, we provide a foundation for future research in self-supervised GCRL, enabling researchers to quickly iterate on new ideas and evaluate them in diverse and challenging environments.

      <title>PDDFormer: Pairwise Distance Distribution Graph Transformer for Crystal Material Property Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12984v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystal structures can be simplified as a periodic point set that repeats across three-dimensional space along an underlying lattice. Traditionally, crystal representation methods characterize the structure using descriptors such as lattice parameters, symmetry, and space groups. However, in reality, atoms in materials always vibrate above absolute zero, causing their positions to fluctuate continuously. This dynamic behavior disrupts the fundamental periodicity of the lattice, making crystal graphs based on static lattice parameters and conventional descriptors discontinuous under slight perturbations. Chemists proposed the pairwise distance distribution (PDD) method to address this problem. However, the completeness of PDD requires defining a large number of neighboring atoms, leading to high computational costs. Additionally, PDD does not account for atomic information, making it challenging to apply it directly to crystal material property prediction tasks. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the atom-Weighted Pairwise Distance Distribution (WPDD) and Unit cell Pairwise Distance Distribution (UPDD) and apply them to the construction of multi-edge crystal graphs. We demonstrate the continuity and general completeness of crystal graphs under slight atomic position perturbations. Moreover, by modeling PDD as global information and integrating it into matrix-based message passing, we significantly reduce computational costs. Comprehensive evaluation results show that WPDDFormer achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across tasks on benchmark datasets such as the Materials Project and JARVIS-DFT.</description>

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models(LLMs) have attracted increasing attention in biomedical domains due to their success in natural language processing. However, the complex traits and heterogeneity of multi-sources genomics data pose significant challenges when adapting these models to the bioinformatics and biomedical field. To address these challenges, we present GP-GPT, the first specialized large language model for genetic-phenotype knowledge representation and genomics relation analysis. Our model is fine-tuned in two stages on a comprehensive corpus composed of over 3,000,000 terms in genomics, proteomics, and medical genetics, derived from multiple large-scale validated datasets and scientific publications. GP-GPT demonstrates proficiency in accurately retrieving medical genetics information and performing common genomics analysis tasks, such as genomics information retrieval and relationship determination. Comparative experiments across domain-specific tasks reveal that GP-GPT outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs, including Llama2, Llama3 and GPT-4. These results highlight GP-GPT's potential to enhance genetic disease relation research and facilitate accurate and efficient analysis in the fields of genomics and medical genetics. Our investigation demonstrated the subtle changes of bio-factor entities' representations in the GP-GPT, which suggested the opportunities for the application of LLMs to advancing gene-phenotype research.</description>

      <title>MedHalu: Hallucinations in Responses to Healthcare Queries by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19492v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are starting to complement traditional information seeking mechanisms such as web search. LLM-powered chatbots like ChatGPT are gaining prominence among the general public. AI chatbots are also increasingly producing content on social media platforms. However, LLMs are also prone to hallucinations, generating plausible yet factually incorrect or fabricated information. This becomes a critical problem when laypeople start seeking information about sensitive issues such as healthcare. Existing works in LLM hallucinations in the medical domain mainly focus on testing the medical knowledge of LLMs through standardized medical exam questions which are often well-defined and clear-cut with definitive answers. However, these approaches may not fully capture how these LLMs perform during real-world interactions with patients. This work conducts a pioneering study on hallucinations in LLM-generated responses to real-world healthcare queries from patients.We introduce MedHalu, a novel medical hallucination benchmark featuring diverse health-related topics and hallucinated responses from LLMs, with detailed annotation of the hallucination types and text spans. We also propose MedHaluDetect, a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLMs' abilities to detect hallucinations. Furthermore, we study the vulnerability to medical hallucinations among three groups -- medical experts, LLMs, and laypeople. Notably, LLMs significantly underperform human experts and, in some cases, even laypeople in detecting medical hallucinations. To improve hallucination detection, we propose an expert-in-the-loop approach that integrates expert reasoning into LLM inputs, significantly improving hallucination detection for all LLMs, including a 6.3% macro-F1 improvement for GPT-4. Our code and dataset are available at https://netsys.surrey.ac.uk/datasets/medhalu/.</description>

      <title>From Code to Correctness: Closing the Last Mile of Code Generation with Hierarchical Debugging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01215v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large language models have made significant strides in code generation, the pass rate of the generated code is bottlenecked on subtle errors, often requiring human intervention to pass tests, especially for complex problems. Existing LLM-based debugging systems treat generated programs as monolithic units, failing to address bugs at multiple levels of granularity, from low-level syntax errors to high-level algorithmic flaws. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Granularity Debugger (MGDebugger), a hierarchical code debugger by isolating, identifying, and resolving bugs at various levels of granularity. MGDebugger decomposes problematic code into a hierarchical tree structure of subfunctions, with each level representing a particular granularity of error. During debugging, it analyzes each subfunction and iteratively resolves bugs in a bottom-up manner. To effectively test each subfunction, we propose an LLM-simulated Python executor, which traces code execution and tracks important variable states to pinpoint errors accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGDebugger outperforms existing debugging systems, achieving an 18.9% improvement in accuracy over seed generations in HumanEval and a 97.6% repair success rate in HumanEvalFix. Furthermore, MGDebugger effectively fixes bugs across different categories and difficulty levels, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>DreamGarden: A Designer Assistant for Growing Games from a Single Prompt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coding assistants are increasingly leveraged in game design, both generating code and making high-level plans. To what degree can these tools align with developer workflows, and what new modes of human-computer interaction can emerge from their use? We present DreamGarden, an AI system capable of assisting with the development of diverse game environments in Unreal Engine. At the core of our method is an LLM-driven planner, capable of breaking down a single, high-level prompt -- a dream, memory, or imagined scenario provided by a human user -- into a hierarchical action plan, which is then distributed across specialized submodules facilitating concrete implementation. This system is presented to the user as a garden of plans and actions, both growing independently and responding to user intervention via seed prompts, pruning, and feedback. Through a user study, we explore design implications of this system, charting courses for future work in semi-autonomous assistants and open-ended simulation design.</description>

      <title>DemoShapley: Valuation of Demonstrations for In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) using in-context learning (ICL) excel in many tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, demonstration selection and ordering greatly impact ICL effectiveness. Focus on this issue, we propose DemoShapley, a Shapley-value based method that evaluates each demonstration's contribution by measuring its marginal effect across different prompt permutations. To further account for ICL's limited context windows and frequent low-shot settings, we introduce Beta-DemoShapley, a weighted extension that emphasizes the influence of smaller prompt sizes. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that DemoShapley consistently outperforms existing influence-based selection strategies, while Beta-DemoShapley further improves performance in low-shot scenarios. Both methods also detect mislabeled data, enhance generalization to out-of-distribution tasks, and reduce demographic bias. Together, they provide a unified and robust framework for demonstration valuation in ICL.</description>

      <title>Investigating Representation Universality: Case Study on Genealogical Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by interpretability and reliability, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) deploy universal geometric structures to encode discrete, graph-structured knowledge. To this end, we present two complementary experimental evidence that might support universality of graph representations. First, on an in-context genealogy Q&amp;A task, we train a cone probe to isolate a tree-like subspace in residual stream activations and use activation patching to verify its causal effect in answering related questions. We validate our findings across five different models. Second, we conduct model stitching experiments across models of diverse architectures and parameter counts (OPT, Pythia, Mistral, and LLaMA, 410 million to 8 billion parameters), quantifying representational alignment via relative degradation in the next-token prediction loss. Generally, we conclude that the lack of ground truth representations of graphs makes it challenging to study how LLMs represent them. Ultimately, improving our understanding of LLM representations could facilitate the development of more interpretable, robust, and controllable AI systems.</description>

      <title>BiasJailbreak:Analyzing Ethical Biases and Jailbreak Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13334v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive proficiency in various tasks, they present potential safety risks, such as `jailbreaks', where malicious inputs can coerce LLMs into generating harmful content bypassing safety alignments. In this paper, we delve into the ethical biases in LLMs and examine how those biases could be exploited for jailbreaks. Notably, these biases result in a jailbreaking success rate in GPT-4o models that differs by 20\% between non-binary and cisgender keywords and by 16\% between white and black keywords, even when the other parts of the prompts are identical. We introduce the concept of BiasJailbreak, highlighting the inherent risks posed by these safety-induced biases. BiasJailbreak generates biased keywords automatically by asking the target LLM itself, and utilizes the keywords to generate harmful output. Additionally, we propose an efficient defense method BiasDefense, which prevents jailbreak attempts by injecting defense prompts prior to generation. BiasDefense stands as an appealing alternative to Guard Models, such as Llama-Guard, that require additional inference cost after text generation. Our findings emphasize that ethical biases in LLMs can actually lead to generating unsafe output, and suggest a method to make the LLMs more secure and unbiased. To enable further research and improvements, we open-source our code and artifacts of BiasJailbreak, providing the community with tools to better understand and mitigate safety-induced biases in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Attention with Mirror Descent: Generalized Max-Margin Token Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14581v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms have revolutionized several domains of artificial intelligence, such as natural language processing and computer vision, by enabling models to selectively focus on relevant parts of the input data. While recent work has characterized the optimization dynamics of gradient descent (GD) in attention-based models and the structural properties of its preferred solutions, less is known about more general optimization algorithms such as mirror descent (MD). In this paper, we investigate the convergence properties and implicit biases of a family of MD algorithms tailored for softmax attention mechanisms, with the potential function chosen as the $p$-th power of the $\ell_p$-norm. Specifically, we show that these algorithms converge in direction to a generalized hard-margin SVM with an $\ell_p$-norm objective when applied to a classification problem using a softmax attention model. Notably, our theoretical results reveal that the convergence rate is comparable to that of traditional GD in simpler models, despite the highly nonlinear and nonconvex nature of the present problem. Additionally, we delve into the joint optimization dynamics of the key-query matrix and the decoder, establishing conditions under which this complex joint optimization converges to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions. Lastly, our numerical experiments on real data demonstrate that MD algorithms improve generalization over standard GD and excel in optimal token selection.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models for Unit Test Generation: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, which fine-tune only a subset of model parameters, offer a promising solution by reducing the computational costs of tuning large language models (LLMs) while maintaining their performance. Existing studies have explored using PEFT and LLMs for various code-related tasks and found that the effectiveness of PEFT techniques is task-dependent. The state-of-the-art is limited to using LLMs with full fine-tuning to generate unit tests. The application of PEFT techniques in unit test generation remains underexplored. This paper investigates both full fine-tuning and various PEFT methods, including LoRA, (IA)^3, and prompt tuning, across thirteen models of different architectures and sizes. We use well-established benchmark datasets to evaluate their effectiveness in unit test generation and measure syntax correctness, CodeBLEU, pass@1, instruction coverage, branch coverage, and mutation score of the generated tests. Our findings show that LoRA can deliver performance comparable to full fine-tuning for unit test generation in several cases. If training costs are valued, prompt tuning is the most cost-effective approach, particularly for large models. However, the models tuned with full fine-tuning or PEFT may generate fewer executable test cases than the baseline model because they generate more tests calling nonexistent methods or having type mismatches. For the generated ones that are executable, the ones from the tuned models show better test coverage than those from the baseline model.</description>

      <title>Video-RAG: Visually-aligned Retrieval-Augmented Long Video Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13093v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing large video-language models (LVLMs) struggle to comprehend long videos correctly due to limited context. To address this problem, fine-tuning long-context LVLMs and employing GPT-based agents have emerged as promising solutions. However, fine-tuning LVLMs would require extensive high-quality data and substantial GPU resources, while GPT-based agents would rely on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o). In this paper, we propose Video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Video-RAG), a training-free and cost-effective pipeline that employs visually-aligned auxiliary texts to help facilitate cross-modality alignment while providing additional information beyond the visual content. Specifically, we leverage open-source external tools to extract visually-aligned information from pure video data (e.g., audio, optical character, and object detection), and incorporate the extracted information into an existing LVLM as auxiliary texts, alongside video frames and queries, in a plug-and-play manner. Our Video-RAG offers several key advantages: (i) lightweight with low computing overhead due to single-turn retrieval; (ii) easy implementation and compatibility with any LVLM; and (iii) significant, consistent performance gains across long video understanding benchmarks, including Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench. Notably, our model demonstrates superior performance over proprietary models like Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o when utilized with a 72B model.</description>

      <title>Lessons from Studying Two-Hop Latent Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16353v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models can use chain-of-thought (CoT) to externalize reasoning, potentially enabling oversight of capable LLM agents. Prior work has shown that models struggle at two-hop question-answering without CoT. This capability is so basic that if it was a fundamental limitation, it would imply that many complex agentic tasks would similarly require CoT. We investigate LLM latent reasoning capabilities using two-hop question answering as a case study. Previous work on the gap between latent and externalized two-hop reasoning produced mixed evidence with inconclusive results. In this paper, we introduce a controlled setting for investigating two-hop reasoning in LLMs, where a positive result provides definitive evidence for latent reasoning. We fine-tune LLMs (including Llama 3 8B and GPT-4o) on synthetic facts and test two-hop reasoning over these facts. By using synthetic facts, we rule out memorization and reasoning shortcuts as explanations for two-hop performance. We observe a nuanced picture: Models fail to compose two synthetic facts, but can succeed when one fact is synthetic and the other is natural. These results demonstrate that LLMs are undeniably capable of latent two-hop reasoning, although it remains unclear how this ability scales with model size. Finally, we highlight a lesson for researchers studying LLM reasoning: when drawing conclusions about LLM latent reasoning, one must be careful to avoid both spurious successes (that stem from memorization and reasoning shortcuts) and spurious failures (that may stem from artificial experimental setups, divorced from training setups of frontier LLMs).</description>

      <title>VideoLights: Feature Refinement and Cross-Task Alignment Transformer for Joint Video Highlight Detection and Moment Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prevailing joint prediction transformers for Video Highlight Detection and Moment Retrieval (HD/MR) exhibit deficiencies in handling cross-task dynamics, achieving robust video-text alignment, and utilizing effective attention mechanisms, with the potential of Large Language/Vision-Language Models (LLMs/LVLMs) being largely untapped. This paper introduces VideoLights, a novel HD/MR framework addressing these limitations by incorporating: (i) Convolutional Projection and Feature Refinement modules with an alignment loss for enhanced video-text feature congruity; (ii) a Bi-Directional Cross-Modal Fusion network for strongly coupled query-aware representations; (iii) a Uni-directional joint-task feedback mechanism for synergistic task improvement; (iv) hard positive/negative losses for adaptive learning; and (v) the leveraging of LVLMs (e.g., BLIP-2) for superior multimodal feature integration and intelligent pre-training with synthetic data. Comprehensive evaluations on QVHighlights, TVSum, and Charades-STA benchmarks demonstrate that VideoLights significantly surpasses existing baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performances.

      <title>SATA: A Paradigm for LLM Jailbreak via Simple Assistive Task Linkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15289v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements across various tasks, but their safety alignment remain a major concern. Exploring jailbreak prompts can expose LLMs' vulnerabilities and guide efforts to secure them. Existing methods primarily design sophisticated instructions for the LLM to follow, or rely on multiple iterations, which could hinder the performance and efficiency of jailbreaks. In this work, we propose a novel jailbreak paradigm, Simple Assistive Task Linkage (SATA), which can effectively circumvent LLM safeguards and elicit harmful responses. Specifically, SATA first masks harmful keywords within a malicious query to generate a relatively benign query containing one or multiple [MASK] special tokens. It then employs a simple assistive task such as a masked language model task or an element lookup by position task to encode the semantics of the masked keywords. Finally, SATA links the assistive task with the masked query to jointly perform the jailbreak. Extensive experiments show that SATA achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms baselines by a large margin. Specifically, on AdvBench dataset, with mask language model (MLM) assistive task, SATA achieves an overall attack success rate (ASR) of 85% and harmful score (HS) of 4.57, and with element lookup by position (ELP) assistive task, SATA attains an overall ASR of 76% and HS of 4.43.</description>

      <title>GMoE: Empowering LLMs Fine-Tuning via MoE Graph Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16216v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture of large language models (LLMs) confronts an inherent issue of load imbalance arising from the simplistic linear router strategy, which ultimately causes the instability and inefficient learning of LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel MoE graph-based framework $\textbf{GMoE}$, aimed at enhancing the collaboration among multiple experts. In GMoE, a graph router function is designed to capture the collaboration signals among experts. This enables all experts to dynamically allocate information derived from input data by sharing information with their neighboring experts. Moreover, we put forward two coordination strategies in GMoE: the $\textit{Poisson distribution-based distinction strategy}$ and the $\textit{Normal distribution-based balance strategy}$, to further release the capacity of each expert and increase the model stability in the fine-tuning of LLMs. Specifically, we leverage a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, i.e., Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to implement the graph MoE architecture. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GMoE, showing the benefits of facilitating collaborations of multiple experts in LLM fine-tuning.

      <title>Learn from Global Correlations: Enhancing Evolutionary Algorithm via Spectral GNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17629v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) simulate natural selection but have two main limitations: (1) they rarely update individuals based on global correlations, limiting comprehensive learning; (2) they struggle with balancing exploration and exploitation, where excessive exploitation causes premature convergence, and excessive exploration slows down the search. Moreover, EAs often depend on manual parameter settings, which can disrupt the exploration-exploitation balance. To address these issues, we propose Graph Neural Evolution (GNE), a novel EA framework. GNE represents the population as a graph, where nodes represent individuals, and edges capture their relationships, enabling global information usage. GNE utilizes spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) to decompose evolutionary signals into frequency components, applying a filtering function to fuse these components. High-frequency components capture diverse global information, while low-frequency ones capture more consistent information. This explicit frequency filtering strategy directly controls global-scale features through frequency components, overcoming the limitations of manual parameter settings and making the exploration-exploitation control more interpretable and manageable. Tests on nine benchmark functions (e.g., Sphere, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock) show that GNE outperforms classical (GA, DE, CMA-ES) and advanced algorithms (SDAES, RL-SHADE) under various conditions, including noise-corrupted and optimal solution deviation scenarios. GNE achieves solutions several orders of magnitude better (e.g., 3.07e-20 mean on Sphere vs. 1.51e-07).</description>

      <title>Human-Inspired Multi-Level Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), a common tool in decision making, learns control policies from various experiences based on the associated cumulative return/rewards without treating them differently. Humans, on the contrary, often learn to distinguish from discrete levels of performance and extract the underlying insights/information (beyond reward signals) towards their decision optimization. For instance, when learning to play tennis, a human player does not treat all unsuccessful attempts equally. Missing the ball completely signals a more severe mistake than hitting it out of bounds (although the cumulative rewards can be similar for both cases). Learning effectively from multi-level experiences is essential in human decision making. This motivates us to develop a novel multi-level RL method that learns from multi-level experiences via extracting multi-level information. At the low level of information extraction, we utilized the existing rating-based reinforcement learning to infer inherent reward signals that illustrate the value of states or state-action pairs accordingly. At the high level of information extraction, we propose to extract important directional information from different-level experiences so that policies can be updated towards desired deviation from these different levels of experiences. Specifically, we propose a new policy loss function that penalizes distribution similarities between the current policy and different-level experiences, and assigns different weights to the penalty terms based on the performance levels. Furthermore, the integration of the two levels towards multi-level RL guides the agent toward policy improvements that benefit both reward improvement and policy improvement, hence yielding a similar learning mechanism as humans.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10100v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning robust and generalizable world models is crucial for enabling efficient and scalable robotic control in real-world environments. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for learning world models that accurately capture complex, partially observable, and stochastic dynamics. The proposed method employs a dual-autoregressive mechanism and self-supervised training to achieve reliable long-horizon predictions without relying on domain-specific inductive biases, ensuring adaptability across diverse robotic tasks. We further propose a policy optimization framework that leverages world models for efficient training in imagined environments and seamless deployment in real-world systems. This work advances model-based reinforcement learning by addressing the challenges of long-horizon prediction, error accumulation, and sim-to-real transfer. By providing a scalable and robust framework, the introduced methods pave the way for adaptive and efficient robotic systems in real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11357v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are high-dimensional state space models capable of learning functions on sequence data. Recently, it has been conjectured that reservoir computers, a particular class of RNNs, trained on observations of a dynamical systems can be interpreted as embeddings. This result has been established for the case of linear reservoir systems. In this work, we use a nonautonomous dynamical systems approach to establish an upper bound for the fractal dimension of the subset of reservoir state space approximated during training and prediction phase. We prove that when the input sequences comes from an Nin-dimensional invertible dynamical system, the fractal dimension of this set is bounded above by Nin. The result obtained here are useful in dimensionality reduction of computation in RNNs as well as estimating fractal dimensions of dynamical systems from limited observations of their time series. It is also a step towards understanding embedding properties of reservoir computers.</description>

      <title>Teacher Encoder-Student Decoder Denoising Guided Segmentation Network for Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12104v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual anomaly detection is a highly challenging task, often categorized as a one-class classification and segmentation problem. Recent studies have demonstrated that the student-teacher (S-T) framework effectively addresses this challenge. However, most S-T frameworks rely solely on pre-trained teacher networks to guide student networks in learning multi-scale similar features, overlooking the potential of the student networks to enhance learning through multi-scale feature fusion. In this study, we propose a novel model named PFADSeg, which integrates a pre-trained teacher network, a denoising student network with multi-scale feature fusion, and a guided anomaly segmentation network into a unified framework. By adopting a unique teacher-encoder and student-decoder denoising mode, the model improves the student network's ability to learn from teacher network features. Furthermore, an adaptive feature fusion mechanism is introduced to train a self-supervised segmentation network that synthesizes anomaly masks autonomously, significantly increasing detection performance. Rigorous evaluations on the widely-used MVTec AD dataset demonstrate that PFADSeg exhibits excellent performance, achieving an image-level AUC of 98.9%, a pixel-level mean precision of 76.4%, and an instance-level mean precision of 78.7%.</description>

      <title>Incalmo: An Autonomous LLM-assisted System for Red Teaming Multi-Host Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16466v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Security operators use red teams to simulate real attackers and proactively find defense gaps. In realistic enterprise settings, this involves executing multi-host network attacks spanning many "stepping stone" hosts. Unfortunately, red teams are expensive and entail significant expertise and effort. Given the promise of LLMs in CTF challenges, we first analyze if LLMs can autonomously execute multi-host red team exercises. We find that state-of-the-art LLM-assisted offense systems (e.g., PentestGPT, CyberSecEval3) with leading LLMs (e.g., Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) are unable to do so.
  Building on our observations in understanding the failure modes of state-of-the-art systems, we argue the need to improve the abstractions and interfaces for LLM-assisted red teaming. Based on this insight, we present the design and implementation of Incalmo, an LLM-assisted system for autonomously red teaming multi-host networks. Incalmo uses LLMs to plan red team exercises in terms of high-level declarative tasks that are executed by domain-specific task agents. Incalmo also uses auxiliary services to manage context and acquired assets.
  For our evaluation, we develop MHBench, a novel multi-host attack benchmark with 40 realistic emulated networks (from 22 to 50 hosts). We find that Incalmo successfully acquires critical assets (i.e., key hosts or data) in 37 out of 40 MHBench environments. In contrast, state-of-the-art LLM-assisted systems succeed in only 3 out of 40 environments. We show that Incalmo is efficient-successful attacks took 12-54 minutes and cost &lt;$15 in LLM credits.</description>

      <title>Learning Mean Field Control on Sparse Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large agent networks are abundant in applications and nature and pose difficult challenges in the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) due to their computational and theoretical complexity. While graphon mean field games and their extensions provide efficient learning algorithms for dense and moderately sparse agent networks, the case of realistic sparser graphs remains largely unsolved. Thus, we propose a novel mean field control model inspired by local weak convergence to include sparse graphs such as power law networks with coefficients above two. Besides a theoretical analysis, we design scalable learning algorithms which apply to the challenging class of graph sequences with finite first moment. We compare our model and algorithms for various examples on synthetic and real world networks with mean field algorithms based on Lp graphons and graphexes. As it turns out, our approach outperforms existing methods in many examples and on various networks due to the special design aiming at an important, but so far hard to solve class of MARL problems.</description>

      <title>Distributive Fairness in Large Language Models: Evaluating Alignment with Human Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing interest in employing large language models (LLMs) for decision-making in social and economic contexts has raised questions about their potential to function as agents in these domains. A significant number of societal problems involve the distribution of resources, where fairness, along with economic efficiency, play a critical role in the desirability of outcomes. In this paper, we examine whether LLM responses adhere to fundamental fairness concepts such as equitability, envy-freeness, and Rawlsian maximin, and investigate their alignment with human preferences. We evaluate the performance of several LLMs, providing a comparative benchmark of their ability to reflect these measures. Our results demonstrate a lack of alignment between current LLM responses and human distributional preferences. Moreover, LLMs are unable to utilize money as a transferable resource to mitigate inequality. Nonetheless, we demonstrate a stark contrast when (some) LLMs are tasked with selecting from a predefined menu of options rather than generating one. In addition, we analyze the robustness of LLM responses to variations in semantic factors (e.g., intentions or personas) or non-semantic prompting changes (e.g., templates or orderings). Finally, we highlight potential strategies aimed at enhancing the alignment of LLM behavior with well-established fairness concepts.</description>

      <title>Pathway to Relevance: How Cross-Encoders Implement a Semantic Variant of BM25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic interpretation has greatly contributed to a more detailed understanding of generative language models, enabling significant progress in identifying structures that implement key behaviors through interactions between internal components. In contrast, interpretability in information retrieval (IR) remains relatively coarse-grained, and much is still unknown as to how IR models determine whether a document is relevant to a query. In this work, we address this gap by mechanistically analyzing how one commonly used model, a cross-encoder, estimates relevance. We find that the model extracts traditional relevance signals, such as term frequency and inverse document frequency, in early-to-middle layers. These concepts are then combined in later layers, similar to the well-known probabilistic ranking function, BM25. Overall, our analysis offers a more nuanced understanding of how IR models compute relevance. Isolating these components lays the groundwork for future interventions that could enhance transparency, mitigate safety risks, and improve scalability.</description>

Abstract: Predicting medical events in advance within critical care settings is paramount for patient outcomes and resource management. Utilizing predictive models, healthcare providers can anticipate issues such as cardiac arrest, sepsis, or respiratory failure before they manifest. Recently, there has been a surge in research focusing on forecasting adverse medical event onsets prior to clinical manifestation using machine learning. However, while these models provide temporal prognostic predictions for the occurrence of a specific adverse event of interest within defined time intervals, their interpretability often remains a challenge. In this work, we explore the applicability of neural temporal point processes in the context of adverse event onset prediction, with the aim of explaining clinical pathways and providing interpretable insights. Our experiments span six state-of-the-art neural point processes and six critical care datasets, each focusing on the onset of distinct adverse events. This work represents a novel application class of neural temporal point processes in event prediction.</description>

      <title>Straight to Zero: Why Linearly Decaying the Learning Rate to Zero Works Best for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs are commonly trained with a learning rate (LR) warmup, followed by cosine decay to 10% of the maximum (10x decay). In a large-scale empirical study, we show that under an optimal peak LR, a simple linear decay-to-zero (D2Z) schedule consistently outperforms other schedules when training at compute-optimal dataset sizes. D2Z is superior across a range of model sizes, batch sizes, datasets, and vocabularies. Benefits increase as dataset size increases. Leveraging a novel interpretation of AdamW as an exponential moving average of weight updates, we show how linear D2Z optimally balances the demands of early training (moving away from initial conditions) and late training (averaging over more updates in order to mitigate gradient noise). In experiments, a 610M-parameter model trained for 80 tokens-per-parameter (TPP) using D2Z achieves lower loss than when trained for 200 TPP using 10x decay, corresponding to an astonishing 60% compute savings. Models such as Llama2-7B, trained for 286 TPP with 10x decay, could likely have saved a majority of compute by training with D2Z.</description>

      <title>Causally Reliable Concept Bottleneck Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concept-based models are an emerging paradigm in deep learning that constrains the inference process to operate through human-interpretable variables, facilitating explainability and human interaction. However, these architectures, on par with popular opaque neural models, fail to account for the true causal mechanisms underlying the target phenomena represented in the data. This hampers their ability to support causal reasoning tasks, limits out-of-distribution generalization, and hinders the implementation of fairness constraints. To overcome these issues, we propose Causally reliable Concept Bottleneck Models (C$^2$BMs), a class of concept-based architectures that enforce reasoning through a bottleneck of concepts structured according to a model of the real-world causal mechanisms. We also introduce a pipeline to automatically learn this structure from observational data and unstructured background knowledge (e.g., scientific literature). Experimental evidence suggests that C$^2$BMs are more interpretable, causally reliable, and improve responsiveness to interventions w.r.t. standard opaque and concept-based models, while maintaining their accuracy.</description>

      <title>LLMs' Reshaping of People, Processes, Products, and Society in Software Development: A Comprehensive Exploration with Early Adopters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly reshaping software development, but their impact across the software development lifecycle is underexplored. Existing work focuses on isolated activities such as code generation or testing, leaving open questions about how LLMs affect developers, processes, products, and the software ecosystem. We address this gap through semi-structured interviews with sixteen early-adopter software professionals who integrated LLM-based tools into their day-to-day work in early to mid-2023. We treat these interviews as early empirical evidence and compare participants' accounts with recent work on LLMs in software engineering, noting which early patterns persist or shift. Using thematic analysis, we organize findings around four dimensions: people, process, product, and society. Developers reported substantial productivity gains from reducing routine tasks, streamlining search, and accelerating debugging, but also described a productivity-quality paradox: they often discarded generated code and shifted effort from writing to critically evaluating and integrating it. LLM use was highly phase-dependent, with strong uptake in implementation and debugging but limited influence on requirements gathering and other collaborative work. Participants developed new competencies to use LLMs effectively, including prompt engineering strategies, layered verification, and secure integration to protect proprietary data. They anticipated changes in hiring expectations, team practices, and computing education, while emphasizing that human judgment and foundational software engineering skills remain essential. Our findings, later echoed in large-scale quantitative studies, offer actionable implications for developers, organizations, educators, and tool designers seeking to integrate LLMs responsibly into software practice today.</description>

      <title>Human Cognition Inspired RAG with Knowledge Graph for Complex Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential across various domains. However, they often struggle with integrating external knowledge and performing complex reasoning, leading to hallucinations and unreliable outputs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to mitigate these issues by incorporating external knowledge. Yet, conventional RAG approaches, especially those based on vector similarity, fail to effectively capture relational dependencies and support multi-step reasoning. In this work, we propose CogGRAG, a human cognition-inspired, graph-based RAG framework designed for Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). CogGRAG models the reasoning process as a tree-structured mind map that decomposes the original problem into interrelated subproblems and explicitly encodes their semantic relationships. This structure not only provides a global view to guide subsequent retrieval and reasoning but also enables self-consistent verification across reasoning paths. The framework operates in three stages: (1) top-down problem decomposition via mind map construction, (2) structured retrieval of both local and global knowledge from external Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and (3) bottom-up reasoning with dual-process self-verification. Unlike previous tree-based decomposition methods such as MindMap or Graph-CoT, CogGRAG unifies problem decomposition, knowledge retrieval, and reasoning under a single graph-structured cognitive framework, allowing early integration of relational knowledge and adaptive verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogGRAG achieves superior accuracy and reliability compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Studying Classifier(-Free) Guidance From a Classifier-Centric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classifier-free guidance has become a staple for conditional generation with denoising diffusion models. However, a comprehensive understanding of classifier-free guidance is still missing. In this work, we carry out an empirical study to provide a fresh perspective on classifier-free guidance. Concretely, instead of solely focusing on classifier-free guidance, we trace back to the root, i.e., classifier guidance, pinpoint the key assumption for the derivation, and conduct a systematic study to understand the role of the classifier. On 1D data, we find that both classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance achieve conditional generation by pushing the denoising diffusion trajectories away from decision boundaries, i.e., areas where conditional information is usually entangled and is hard to learn. To validate this classifier-centric perspective on high-dimensional data, we assess whether a flow-matching postprocessing step that is designed to narrow the gap between a pre-trained diffusion model's learned distribution and the real data distribution, especially near decision boundaries, can improve the performance. Experiments on various datasets verify our classifier-centric understanding.</description>

      <title>Word-level Annotation of GDPR Transparency Compliance in Privacy Policies using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring transparency of data practices related to personal information is a core requirement of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). However, large-scale compliance assessment remains challenging due to the complexity and diversity of privacy policy language. Manual audits are labour-intensive and inconsistent, while current automated methods often lack the granularity required to capture nuanced transparency disclosures.
  In this paper, we present a modular large language model (LLM)-based pipeline for fine-grained word-level annotation of privacy policies with respect to GDPR transparency requirements. Our approach integrates LLM-driven annotation with passage-level classification, retrieval-augmented generation, and a self-correction mechanism to deliver scalable, context-aware annotations across 21 GDPR-derived transparency requirements. To support empirical evaluation, we compile a corpus of 703,791 English-language privacy policies and generate a ground-truth sample of 200 manually annotated policies based on a comprehensive, GDPR-aligned annotation scheme.
  We propose a two-tiered evaluation methodology capturing both passage-level classification and span-level annotation quality and conduct a comparative analysis of seven state-of-the-art LLMs on two annotation schemes, including the widely used OPP-115 dataset. The results of our evaluation show that decomposing the annotation task and integrating targeted retrieval and classification components significantly improve annotation accuracy, particularly for well-structured requirements. Our work provides new empirical resources and methodological foundations for advancing automated transparency compliance assessment at scale.</description>

      <title>1000 Layer Networks for Self-Supervised RL: Scaling Depth Can Enable New Goal-Reaching Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling up self-supervised learning has driven breakthroughs in language and vision, yet comparable progress has remained elusive in reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we study building blocks for self-supervised RL that unlock substantial improvements in scalability, with network depth serving as a critical factor. Whereas most RL papers in recent years have relied on shallow architectures (around 2 - 5 layers), we demonstrate that increasing the depth up to 1024 layers can significantly boost performance. Our experiments are conducted in an unsupervised goal-conditioned setting, where no demonstrations or rewards are provided, so an agent must explore (from scratch) and learn how to maximize the likelihood of reaching commanded goals. Evaluated on simulated locomotion and manipulation tasks, our approach increases performance on the self-supervised contrastive RL algorithm by $2\times$ - $50\times$, outperforming other goal-conditioned baselines. Increasing the model depth not only increases success rates but also qualitatively changes the behaviors learned.

      <title>FinAudio: A Benchmark for Audio Large Language Models in Financial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs) have received widespread attention and have significantly improved performance on audio tasks such as conversation, audio understanding, and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Despite these advancements, there is an absence of a benchmark for assessing AudioLLMs in financial scenarios, where audio data, such as earnings conference calls and CEO speeches, are crucial resources for financial analysis and investment decisions. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{FinAudio}, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capacity of AudioLLMs in the financial domain. We first define three tasks based on the unique characteristics of the financial domain: 1) ASR for short financial audio, 2) ASR for long financial audio, and 3) summarization of long financial audio. Then, we curate two short and two long audio datasets, respectively, and develop a novel dataset for financial audio summarization, comprising the \textsc{FinAudio} benchmark. Then, we evaluate seven prevalent AudioLLMs on \textsc{FinAudio}. Our evaluation reveals the limitations of existing AudioLLMs in the financial domain and offers insights for improving AudioLLMs. All datasets and codes will be released.</description>

      <title>CodeIF-Bench: Evaluating Instruction-Following Capabilities of Large Language Models in Interactive Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22688v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in code generation tasks and have become indispensable programming assistants for developers. However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily assess the functional correctness of code generated by LLMs in single-turn interactions. They offer limited insight into LLMs' abilities to generate code that strictly follows users' instructions in multi-turn interaction scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs in interactive code generation. Specifically, CodeIF-Bench incorporates nine types of verifiable instructions aligned with the real-world software development requirements, which can be independently and objectively validated through specified test cases, facilitating the evaluation of instruction-following capability in multi-turn interactions. In both Static Conversation and Dynamic Conversation settings, we evaluate the performance of 6 state-of-the-art LLMs and summarize the important factors, additional repository context and gradually increasing interaction history influencing the instruction-following ability of LLMs in multi-turn interactions. Furthermore, we identify the potential direction for improvement: context management.

      <title>Benchmarking the Spatial Robustness of DNNs via Natural and Adversarial Localized Corruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The robustness of deep neural networks is a crucial factor in safety-critical applications, particularly in complex and dynamic environments (e.g., medical or driving scenarios) where localized corruptions can arise. While previous studies have evaluated the robustness of semantic segmentation (SS) models under whole-image natural or adversarial corruptions, a comprehensive investigation into the spatial robustness of dense vision models under localized corruptions remains underexplored. This paper fills this gap by introducing novel, region-aware metrics for benchmarking the spatial robustness of segmentation models, along with an evaluation framework to assess the impact of natural localized corruptions. Furthermore, it uncovers the inherent complexity of evaluating worst-case spatial robustness using only a single localized adversarial attack. To address this, the work proposes a region-aware multi-attack adversarial analysis to systematically assess model robustness across specific image regions. The proposed metrics and analysis were exploited to evaluate 14 segmentation models in driving scenarios, uncovering key insights into the effects of localized corruption in both natural and adversarial forms. The results reveal that models respond to these two types of threats differently; for instance, transformer-based segmentation models demonstrate notable robustness to localized natural corruptions but are highly vulnerable to adversarial ones, and vice versa for CNN-based models. Consequently, we also address the challenge of balancing robustness to both natural and adversarial localized corruptions by means of ensemble models, thereby achieving a broader threat coverage and improved reliability for dense vision tasks.</description>

      <title>VALUE: Value-Aware Large Language Model for Query Rewriting via Weighted Trie in Sponsored Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Query-to-bidword(i.e., bidding keyword) rewriting is fundamental to sponsored search, transforming noisy user queries into semantically relevant and commercially valuable keywords. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) improve semantic relevance through generative retrieval frameworks, but they rarely encode the commercial value of keywords. As a result, rewrites are often semantically correct yet economically suboptimal, and a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stage is usually added after supervised fine-tuning(SFT) to mitigate this deficiency. However, conventional preference alignment frequently overemphasize the ordering of bidword values and is susceptible to overfitting, which degrades rewrite quality. In addition, bidword value changes rapidly, while existing generative methods do not respond to these fluctuations. To address this shortcoming, we introduce VALUE(Value-Aware Large language model for qUery rewriting via wEighted trie), a framework that integrates value awareness directly into generation and enhances value alignment during training. VALUE employs the Weighted Trie, a novel variant of the classical trie that stores real-time value signals for each token. During decoding, the framework adjusts the LLM's token probabilities with these signals, constraining the search space and steering generation toward high-value rewrites. The alignment stage uses a fine-grained preference learning strategy that emphasizes stable, high-value differences and down-weights noisy or transient fluctuations, thereby improving robustness and reducing overfitting. Offline experiments show that VALUE significantly outperforms baselines in both semantic matching and value-centric metrics. VALUE has been deployed on our advertising system since October 2024 and served the Double Eleven promotions, the biggest shopping carnival in China.</description>

      <title>Entropic Time Schedulers for Generative Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13612v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The practical performance of generative diffusion models depends on the appropriate choice of the noise scheduling function, which can also be equivalently expressed as a time reparameterization. In this paper, we present a time scheduler that selects sampling points based on entropy rather than uniform time spacing, ensuring that each point contributes an equal amount of information to the final generation. We prove that this time reparameterization does not depend on the initial choice of time. Furthermore, we provide a tractable exact formula to estimate this \emph{entropic time} for a trained model using the training loss without substantial overhead. Alongside the entropic time, inspired by the optimality results, we introduce a rescaled entropic time. In our experiments with mixtures of Gaussian distributions and ImageNet, we show that using the (rescaled) entropic times greatly improves the inference performance of trained models. In particular, we found that the image quality in pretrained EDM2 models, as evaluated by FID and FD-DINO scores, can be substantially increased by the rescaled entropic time reparameterization without increasing the number of function evaluations, with greater improvements in the few NFEs regime. Code is available at https://github.com/DejanStancevic/Entropic-Time-Schedulers-for-Generative-Diffusion-Models.</description>

      <title>M2R2: MultiModal Robotic Representation for Temporal Action Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal action segmentation (TAS) has long been a key area of research in both robotics and computer vision. In robotics, algorithms have primarily focused on leveraging proprioceptive information to determine skill boundaries, with recent approaches in surgical robotics incorporating vision. In contrast, computer vision typically relies on exteroceptive sensors, such as cameras. Existing multimodal TAS models in robotics integrate feature fusion within the model, making it difficult to reuse learned features across different models. Meanwhile, pretrained vision-only feature extractors commonly used in computer vision struggle in scenarios with limited object visibility. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing M2R2, a multimodal feature extractor tailored for TAS, which combines information from both proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors. We introduce a novel pretraining strategy that enables the reuse of learned features across multiple TAS models. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the REASSEMBLE dataset, a challenging multimodal robotic assembly dataset, outperforming existing robotic action segmentation models by 46.6%. Additionally, we conduct an extensive ablation study to evaluate the contribution of different modalities in robotic TAS tasks.</description>

      <title>FalconWing: An Ultra-Light Indoor Fixed-Wing UAV Platform for Vision-Based Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce FalconWing, an ultra-light (150 g) indoor fixed-wing UAV platform for vision-based autonomy. Controlled indoor environment enables year-round repeatable UAV experiment but imposes strict weight and maneuverability limits on the UAV, motivating our ultra-light FalconWing design. FalconWing couples a lightweight hardware stack (137g airframe with a 9g camera) and offboard computation with a software stack featuring a photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splat (GSplat) simulator for developing and evaluating vision-based controllers. We validate FalconWing on two challenging vision-based aerial case studies. In the leader-follower case study, our best vision-based controller, trained via imitation learning on GSplat-rendered data augmented with domain randomization, achieves 100% tracking success across 3 types of leader maneuvers over 30 trials and shows robustness to leader's appearance shifts in simulation. In the autonomous landing case study, our vision-based controller trained purely in simulation transfers zero-shot to real hardware, achieving an 80% success rate over ten landing trials. We will release hardware designs, GSplat scenes, and dynamics models upon publication to make FalconWing an open-source flight kit for engineering students and research labs.</description>

      <title>Can LLM-based Financial Investing Strategies Outperform the Market in Long Run?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07078v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been leveraged for asset pricing tasks and stock trading applications, enabling AI agents to generate investment decisions from unstructured financial data. However, most evaluations of LLM timing-based investing strategies are conducted on narrow timeframes and limited stock universes, overstating effectiveness due to survivorship and data-snooping biases. We critically assess their generalizability and robustness by proposing FINSABER, a backtesting framework evaluating timing-based strategies across longer periods and a larger universe of symbols. Systematic backtests over two decades and 100+ symbols reveal that previously reported LLM advantages deteriorate significantly under broader cross-section and over a longer-term evaluation. Our market regime analysis further demonstrates that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets, underperforming passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets, incurring heavy losses. These findings highlight the need to develop LLM strategies that are able to prioritise trend detection and regime-aware risk controls over mere scaling of framework complexity.</description>

      <title>Toward Adaptive Categories: Dimensional Governance for Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI systems evolve from static tools to dynamic agents, traditional categorical governance frameworks -- based on fixed risk tiers, levels of autonomy, or human oversight models -- are increasingly insufficient on their own. Systems built on foundation models, self-supervised learning, and multi-agent architectures increasingly blur the boundaries that categories were designed to police. In this Perspective, we make the case for dimensional governance: a framework that tracks how decision authority, process autonomy, and accountability (the 3As) distribute dynamically across human-AI relationships. A critical advantage of this approach is its ability to explicitly monitor system movement toward and across key governance thresholds, enabling preemptive adjustments before risks materialize. This dimensional approach provides the necessary foundation for more adaptive categorization, enabling thresholds and classifications that can evolve with emerging capabilities. While categories remain essential for decision-making, building them upon dimensional foundations allows for context-specific adaptability and stakeholder-responsive governance that static approaches cannot achieve. We outline key dimensions, critical trust thresholds, and practical examples illustrating where rigid categorical frameworks fail -- and where a dimensional mindset could offer a more resilient and future-proof path forward for both governance and innovation at the frontier of artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Power Lines: Scaling Laws for Weight Decay and Batch Size in LLM Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13738</link>

Abstract: Efficient LLM pre-training requires well-tuned hyperparameters (HPs), including learning rate $\eta$ and weight decay $\lambda$. We study scaling laws for HPs: formulas for how to scale HPs as we scale model size N, dataset size D, and batch size B. Recent work suggests the AdamW timescale, $\tau = B/(\eta \lambda D)$, should remain constant across training settings, and we verify the implication that optimal $\lambda$ scales linearly with B, for a fixed N and D. However, as N and D scale, we show optimal $\tau$ obeys a precise power law in the tokens-per-parameter ratio, D/N. This law thus provides a method to accurately predict $\lambda$opt in advance of large-scale training. We also study scaling laws for optimal batch size Bopt (the B enabling lowest loss at a given N,D) and critical batch size Bcrit (the B beyond which further data parallelism becomes ineffective). In contrast to prior work, we find both Bopt and Bcrit scale as power laws in D, independent of model size, N. Finally, we analyze how these findings inform the real-world selection of Pareto-optimal N and D under dual training time and compute objectives. All experiments were run on Cerebras CS-3 systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Semantics: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Reasonless Intermediate Tokens</title>

Abstract: Recent impressive results from large reasoning models have been interpreted as a triumph of Chain of Thought (CoT), especially of training on CoTs sampled from base LLMs to help find new reasoning patterns. While these traces certainly seem to help model performance, it is not clear how they actually influence it, with some works ascribing semantics to the traces and others cautioning against relying on them as transparent and faithful proxies of the model's internal computational process. To systematically investigate the role of end-user semantics of derivational traces, we set up a controlled study where we train transformer models from scratch on formally verifiable reasoning traces and the solutions they lead to. We notice that, despite significant gains over the solution-only baseline, models trained on entirely correct traces can still produce invalid reasoning traces even when arriving at correct solutions. More interestingly, our experiments also show that models trained on corrupted traces, whose intermediate reasoning steps bear no relation to the problem they accompany, perform similarly to those trained on correct ones, and even generalize better on out-of-distribution tasks. We also study the effect of GRPO-based RL post-training on trace validity, noting that while solution accuracy increase, this is not accompanied by any improvements in trace validity. Finally, we examine whether reasoning-trace length reflects inference-time scaling and find that trace length is largely agnostic to the underlying computational complexity of the problem being solved. These results challenge the assumption that intermediate tokens or ``Chains of Thought'' reflect or induce predictable reasoning behaviors and caution against anthropomorphizing such outputs or over-interpreting them (despite their mostly seemingly forms) as evidence of human-like or algorithmic behaviors in language models.</description>

      <title>Simulating Macroeconomic Expectations using LLM Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for simulating macroeconomic expectations using Large Language Model-Empowered Agents (LLM Agents). By constructing LLM Agents equipped with various functional modules, we replicate three representative survey experiments involving several expectations across different types of economic agents. Our results show that although the expectations simulated by LLM Agents are more homogeneous than those of humans, they consistently outperform LLMs relying simply on prompt engineering, and possess human-like mental mechanisms. Evaluation reveals that these capabilities stem from the contributions of their components, offering guidelines for their architectural design. Our approach complements traditional methods and provides new insights into AI behavioral science in macroeconomic research</description>

      <title>FlowCut: Rethinking Redundancy via Information Flow for Efficient Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19536v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) excel at multimodal understanding but suffer from high computational costs due to redundant vision tokens. Existing pruning methods typically rely on single-layer attention scores to rank and prune redundant visual tokens to solve this inefficiency. However, as the interaction between tokens and layers is complicated, this raises a basic question: Is such a simple single-layer criterion sufficient to identify redundancy? To answer this question, we rethink the emergence of redundant visual tokens from a fundamental perspective: information flow, which models the interaction between tokens and layers by capturing how information moves between tokens across layers. We find (1) the CLS token acts as an information relay, which can simplify the complicated flow analysis; (2) the redundancy emerges progressively and dynamically via layer-wise attention concentration; and (3) relying solely on attention scores from single layers can lead to contradictory redundancy identification. Based on this, we propose FlowCut, an information-flow-aware pruning framework, mitigating the insufficiency of the current criterion for identifying redundant tokens and better aligning with the model's inherent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that FlowCut achieves superior results, outperforming SoTA by 1.6% on LLaVA-1.5-7B with 88.9% token reduction, and by 4.3% on LLaVA-NeXT-7B with 94.4% reduction, delivering 3.2x speed-up in the prefilling stage.

Abstract: Autonomous robots operating in complex, unstructured environments face significant challenges due to latent, unobserved factors that obscure their understanding of both their internal state and the external world. Addressing this challenge would enable robots to develop a more profound grasp of their operational context. To tackle this, we propose a novel framework for online learning of hidden state representations, with which the robots can adapt in real-time to uncertain and dynamic conditions that would otherwise be ambiguous and result in suboptimal or erroneous behaviors. Our approach is formalized as a Generalized Hidden Parameter Markov Decision Process, which explicitly models the influence of unobserved parameters on both transition dynamics and reward structures. Our core innovation lies in learning online the joint distribution of state transitions, which serves as an expressive representation of latent ego- and environmental-factors. This probabilistic approach supports the identification and adaptation to different operational situations, improving robustness and safety. Through a multivariate extension of Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection, our method segments changes in the underlying data generating process governing the robot's dynamics. The robot's transition model is then informed with a symbolic representation of the current situation derived from the joint distribution of latest state transitions, enabling adaptive and context-aware decision-making. To showcase the real-world effectiveness, we validate our approach in the challenging task of unstructured terrain navigation, where unmodeled and unmeasured terrain characteristics can significantly impact the robot's motion. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real world reveal significant improvements in data efficiency, policy performance, and the emergence of safer, adaptive navigation strategies.</description>

      <title>REAL-Prover: Retrieval Augmented Lean Prover for Mathematical Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, formal theorem provers have made monumental progress on high-school and competition-level mathematics, but few of them generalize to more advanced mathematics. In this paper, we present REAL-Prover, a new open-source stepwise theorem prover for Lean 4 to push this boundary. This prover, based on our fine-tuned large language model (REAL-Prover-v1) and integrated with a retrieval system (Leansearch-PS), notably boosts performance on solving college-level mathematics problems. To train REAL-Prover-v1, we developed HERALD-AF, a data extraction pipeline that converts natural language math problems into formal statements, and a new open-source Lean 4 interactive environment (Jixia-interactive) to facilitate synthesis data collection. In our experiments, our prover using only supervised fine-tune achieves competitive results with a 23.7% success rate (Pass@64) on the ProofNet dataset-comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To further evaluate our approach, we introduce FATE-M, a new benchmark focused on algebraic problems, where our prover achieves a SOTA success rate of 56.7% (Pass@64).</description>

      <title>How does Alignment Enhance LLMs' Multilingual Capabilities? A Language Neurons Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilingual Alignment is an effective and representative paradigm to enhance LLMs' multilingual capabilities, which transfers the capabilities from the high-resource languages to the low-resource languages. Meanwhile, some research on language-specific neurons provides a new perspective to analyze and understand LLMs' mechanisms. However, we find that there are many neurons that are shared by multiple but not all languages and cannot be correctly classified. In this work, we propose a ternary classification methodology that categorizes neurons into three types, including language-specific neurons, language-related neurons, and general neurons. And we propose a corresponding identification algorithm to distinguish these different types of neurons. Furthermore, based on the distributional characteristics of different types of neurons, we divide the LLMs' internal process for multilingual inference into four parts: (1) multilingual understanding, (2) shared semantic space reasoning, (3) multilingual output space transformation, and (4) vocabulary space outputting. Additionally, we systematically analyze the models before and after alignment with a focus on different types of neurons. We also analyze the phenomenon of ''Spontaneous Multilingual Alignment''. Overall, our work conducts a comprehensive investigation based on different types of neurons, providing empirical results and valuable insights to better understand multilingual alignment and multilingual capabilities of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Spatial Knowledge Graph-Guided Multimodal Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities; however, their spatial perception abilities remain a notable limitation. To address this challenge, multimodal data synthesis offers a promising solution. Yet, ensuring that synthesized data adhere to spatial common sense is a non-trivial task. Our approach addresses this critical gap by providing a systematic framework for generating spatially coherent data. In this work, we introduce SKG2DATA, a novel multimodal synthesis approach guided by spatial knowledge graphs, grounded in the concept of knowledge-to-data generation. SKG2DATA employs an automated pipeline for constructing Spatial Knowledge Graph (SKG) that effectively captures human-like spatial cognition, including directional and distance relationships. These structured representations then serve as precise guidance for our integrated synthesis pipeline, where a diffusion model generates spatially-consistent images while a MLLM produces corresponding textual descriptions. The automated construction of SKG enables scalable generation of diverse yet realistic spatial configurations, overcoming the limitations of manual data collection and annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data synthesized from diverse types of spatial knowledge, including direction and distance, enhance the spatial perception and reasoning abilities of MLLMs markedly, albeit with a slight cost to their general capabilities. We hope that the idea of knowledge-based data synthesis can advance the development of spatial intelligence. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/Knowledge2Data.</description>

      <title>Estimating LLM Consistency: A User Baseline vs Surrogate Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23799v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations and sensitive to prompt perturbations, often resulting in inconsistent or unreliable generated text. Different methods have been proposed to mitigate such hallucinations and fragility, one of which is to measure the consistency of LLM responses -- the model's confidence in the response or likelihood of generating a similar response when resampled. In previous work, measuring LLM response consistency often relied on calculating the probability of a response appearing within a pool of resampled responses, analyzing internal states, or evaluating logits of responses. However, it was not clear how well these approaches approximated users' perceptions of consistency of LLM responses. To find out, we performed a user study ($n=2,976$) demonstrating that current methods for measuring LLM response consistency typically do not align well with humans' perceptions of LLM consistency. We propose a logit-based ensemble method for estimating LLM consistency and show that our method matches the performance of the best-performing existing metric in estimating human ratings of LLM consistency. Our results suggest that methods for estimating LLM consistency without human evaluation are sufficiently imperfect to warrant broader use of evaluation with human input; this would avoid misjudging the adequacy of models because of the imperfections of automated consistency metrics.</description>

      <title>DriveSuprim: Towards Precise Trajectory Selection for End-to-End Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must navigate safely in complex driving environments. Imitating a single expert trajectory, as in regression-based approaches, usually does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory. Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each. However, they face optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands of candidates and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences, especially in rare and challenging scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, with 83.02 Driving Score and 60.00 Success Rate on the Bench2Drive benchmark, demonstrating superior planning capabilities in various driving scenarios.</description>

      <title>AbstRaL: Augmenting LLMs' Reasoning by Reinforcing Abstract Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs), especially smaller ones, often lack robustness in grade school math (GSM) reasoning. In particular, they tend to experience performance drops when faced with distribution shifts, such as changes to numerical or nominal variables, or insertions of distracting clauses. A possible strategy to address this involves generating synthetic data to further "instantiate" reasoning problems on potential variations. In this work, we instead focuses on the strategy of "abstracting" reasoning problems. This not only helps counteract distribution shifts but also facilitates the connection to symbolic tools for deriving solutions. Focusing on GSM, we find that this abstraction process is better acquired through reinforcement learning (RL) than just supervised fine-tuning, which often fails to produce faithful abstractions. Our method, AbstRaL -- which promotes abstract reasoning in LLMs using RL on granular abstraction data -- significantly mitigates performance degradation on recent GSM perturbation benchmarks. Besides, improving GSM robustness via AbstRaL is shown to also implicitly benefit LLMs' capabilities on OOD mathematical and general reasoning tasks, indicating that abstract thinking broadly enables better generalizability.</description>

      <title>BemaGANv2: A Tutorial and Comparative Survey of GAN-based Vocoders for Long-Term Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a tutorial-style survey and implementation guide of BemaGANv2, an advanced GANbased vocoder designed for high-fidelity and long-term audio generation. Long-term audio generation is critical for applications in Text-to-Music (TTM) and Text-to-Audio (TTA) systems, where maintaining temporal coherence, prosodic consistency, and harmonic structure over extended durations remains a significant challenge. Built upon the original BemaGAN architecture, BemaGANv2 incorporates major architectural innovations by replacing traditional ResBlocks in the generator with the Anti-aliased Multi-Periodicity composition (AMP) module, which internally applies the Snake activation function to better model periodic structures. In the discriminator framework, we integrate the Multi-Envelope Discriminator (MED), a novel architecture we proposed, to extract rich temporal envelope features crucial for periodicity detection. Coupled with the Multi-Resolution Discriminator (MRD), this combination enables more accurate modeling of long-range dependencies in audio. We systematically evaluate various discriminator configurations, including Multi-Scale Discriminator (MSD) + MED, MSD + MRD, and Multi-Period Discriminator (MPD) + MED + MRD, using objective metrics (Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Mel-Cepstral Distortion (MCD)) and subjective evaluations (MOS, SMOS). This paper also provides a comprehensive tutorial on the model architecture, training methodology, and implementation to promote reproducibility. The code and pre-trained models are available at: https://github.com/dinhoitt/BemaGANv2.</description>

      <title>Athena: Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning with Data-efficient Process Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems. Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data, we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios: verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios. Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score, showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with a significant margin on five benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Q-SAM2: Accurate Quantization for Segment Anything Model 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) is a powerful foundation model for promptable segmentation. However, its high computational and memory costs are a major barrier to deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present Q-SAM2, an accurate low-bit quantization method that achieves high compression and high fidelity. To address performance degradation arising from challenging weight and activation distributions during quantization, Q-SAM2 introduces two novel contributions: Variance-Reduced Calibration (VRC), an initialization method that reduces weight statistical variance by minimizing the Frobenius norm over a small calibration batch; and Learnable Statistical Clipping (LSC), a Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) method that learns momentum-stabilized clipping factors to manage outliers in weights and activations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Q-SAM2 achieves highly accurate inference with substantial efficiency gains, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art general QAT schemes, particularly in the ultra-low 2-bit regime. Specifically, Q-SAM2 achieves an accuracy gain of up to 9.7 ppt in J&amp;F on the video segmentation benchmark and 7.3 ppt in mIoU for instance segmentation over the best competing QAT model, all while achieving an 8x reduction in model size compared to the BF16 baseline.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Generative Categories and Techniques in Multimodal Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Generative Models (MGMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music, video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends, and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques and unresolved challenges. Building on a common taxonomy of models and training recipes, we propose a unified evaluation framework centred on faithfulness, compositionality, and robustness, and synthesise evidence from benchmarks and human studies across modalities. We further analyse trustworthiness, safety, and ethical risks, including multimodal bias, privacy leakage, and the misuse of high-fidelity media generation for deepfakes, disinformation, and copyright infringement in music and 3D assets, together with emerging mitigation strategies. Finally, we discuss how architectural trends, evaluation protocols, and governance mechanisms can be co-designed to close current capability and safety gaps, outlining critical paths toward more general-purpose, controllable, and accountable multimodal generative systems.</description>

      <title>One SPACE to Rule Them All: Jointly Mitigating Factuality and Faithfulness Hallucinations in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by persistent factuality and faithfulness hallucinations. While existing methods address these hallucination types independently, they inadvertently induce performance trade-offs, as interventions targeting one type often exacerbate the other. Through empirical and theoretical analysis of activation space dynamics in LLMs, we reveal that these hallucination categories share overlapping subspaces within neural representations, presenting an opportunity for concurrent mitigation. To harness this insight, we propose SPACE, a unified framework that jointly enhances factuality and faithfulness by editing shared activation subspaces. SPACE establishes a geometric foundation for shared subspace existence through dual-task feature modeling, then identifies and edits these subspaces via a hybrid probe strategy combining spectral clustering and attention head saliency scoring. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.</description>

      <title>Personalized LLM Decoding via Contrasting Personal Preference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are progressively deployed in various real-world applications, personalization of LLMs has become increasingly important. While various approaches to LLM personalization such as prompt-based and training-based methods have been actively explored, the development of effective decoding-time algorithms remains largely overlooked, despite their demonstrated potential. In this paper, we propose CoPe (Contrasting Personal Preference), a novel decoding-time approach applied after performing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on user-specific data. Our core idea is to leverage reward-guided decoding specifically for personalization by maximizing each user's implicit reward signal. We evaluate CoPe across five open-ended personalized text generation tasks. Our empirical results demonstrate that CoPe achieves strong performance, improving personalization by an average of 10.57% in ROUGE-L, without relying on external reward models or additional training procedures.</description>

      <title>Automatic Multi-View X-Ray/CT Registration Using Bone Substructure Contours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Accurate intraoperative X-ray/CT registration is essential for surgical navigation in orthopedic procedures. However, existing methods struggle with consistently achieving sub-millimeter accuracy, robustness under broad initial pose estimates or need manual key-point annotations. This work aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-view X-ray/CT registration method for intraoperative bone registration. Methods: The proposed registration method consists of a multi-view, contour-based iterative closest point (ICP) optimization. Unlike previous methods, which attempt to match bone contours across the entire silhouette in both imaging modalities, we focus on matching specific subcategories of contours corresponding to bone substructures. This leads to reduced ambiguity in the ICP matches, resulting in a more robust and accurate registration solution. This approach requires only two X-ray images and operates fully automatically. Additionally, we contribute a dataset of 5 cadaveric specimens, including real X-ray images, X-ray image poses and the corresponding CT scans. Results: The proposed registration method is evaluated on real X-ray images using mean reprojection error (mRPD). The method consistently achieves sub-millimeter accuracy with a mRPD 0.67mm compared to 5.35mm by a commercial solution requiring manual intervention. Furthermore, the method offers improved practical applicability, being fully automatic. Conclusion: Our method offers a practical, accurate, and efficient solution for multi-view X-ray/CT registration in orthopedic surgeries, which can be easily combined with tracking systems. By improving registration accuracy and minimizing manual intervention, it enhances intraoperative navigation, contributing to more accurate and effective surgical outcomes in computer-assisted surgery (CAS).</description>

      <title>AutoHFormer: Efficient Hierarchical Autoregressive Transformer for Time Series Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting requires architectures that simultaneously achieve three competing objectives: (1) strict temporal causality for reliable predictions, (2) sub-quadratic complexity for practical scalability, and (3) multi-scale pattern recognition for accurate long-horizon forecasting. We introduce AutoHFormer, a hierarchical autoregressive transformer that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: 1) Hierarchical Temporal Modeling: Our architecture decomposes predictions into segment-level blocks processed in parallel, followed by intra-segment sequential refinement. This dual-scale approach maintains temporal coherence while enabling efficient computation. 2) Dynamic Windowed Attention: The attention mechanism employs learnable causal windows with exponential decay, reducing complexity while preserving precise temporal relationships. This design avoids both the anti-causal violations of standard transformers and the sequential bottlenecks of RNN hybrids. 3) Adaptive Temporal Encoding: a novel position encoding system is adopted to capture time patterns at multiple scales. It combines fixed oscillating patterns for short-term variations with learnable decay rates for long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AutoHFormer 10.76X faster training and 6.06X memory reduction compared to PatchTST on PEMS08, while maintaining consistent accuracy across 96-720 step horizons in most of cases. These breakthroughs establish new benchmarks for efficient and precise time series modeling. Implementations of our method and all baselines in hierarchical autoregressive mechanism are available at https://github.com/lizzyhku/Autotime.</description>

      <title>GFlowGR: Fine-tuning Generative Recommendation Frameworks with Generative Flow Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative recommendations (GR), which usually include item tokenizers and generative Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of scenarios. The majority of existing research efforts primarily concentrate on developing powerful item tokenizers or advancing LLM decoding strategies to attain superior performance. However, the critical fine-tuning step in GR frameworks, which is essential for adapting LLMs to recommendation data, remains largely unexplored. Current approaches predominantly rely on either the next-token prediction loss of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or recommendationspecific direct preference optimization (DPO) strategies. Both methods ignore the exploration of possible positive unobserved samples, which is commonly referred to as the exposure bias problem. To mitigate this problem, this paper treats the GR as a multi-step generation task and constructs a GFlowNets-based fine-tuning framework (GFlowGR). The proposed framework integrates collaborative knowledge from traditional recommender systems to create an adaptive trajectory sampler and a comprehensive reward model. Leveraging the diverse generation property of GFlowNets, along with sampling and heuristic weighting techniques, GFlowGR emerges as a promising approach to mitigate the exposure bias problem. Extensive empirical results on two real-world datasets and with two different GR backbones highlight the effectiveness and robustness of GFlowGR.</description>

      <title>ReCode: Updating Code API Knowledge with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20495v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ReCode.</description>

      <title>Meta Policy Switching for Secure UAV Deconfliction in Adversarial Airspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous UAV navigation using reinforcement learning (RL) is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate sensor inputs, potentially leading to unsafe behavior and mission failure. Although robust RL methods provide partial protection, they often struggle to generalize to unseen or out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks due to their reliance on fixed perturbation settings. To address this limitation, we propose a meta-policy switching framework in which a meta-level polic dynamically selects among multiple robust policies to counter unknown adversarial shifts. At the core of this framework lies a discounted Thompson sampling (DTS) mechanism that formulates policy selection as a multi-armed bandit problem, thereby minimizing value distribution shifts via self-induced adversarial observations. We first construct a diverse ensemble of action-robust policies trained under varying perturbation intensities. The DTS-based meta-policy then adaptively selects among these policies online, optimizing resilience against self-induced, piecewise-stationary attacks. Theoretical analysis shows that the DTS mechanism minimizes expected regret, ensuring adaptive robustness to OOD attacks and exhibiting emergent antifragile behavior under uncertainty. Extensive simulations in complex 3D obstacle environments under both white-box (Projected Gradient Descent) and black-box (GPS spoofing) attacks demonstrate significantly improved navigation efficiency and higher conflict free trajectory rates compared to standard robust and vanilla RL baselines, highlighting the practical security and dependability benefits of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>FedRef: Communication-Efficient Bayesian Fine-Tuning using a Reference Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23210v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) collaboratively trains artificial intelligence (AI) models to ensure user data privacy. Sharing only model updates generated from local training on client data with the server enhances user data privacy. However, model performance may suffer due to data and system heterogeneity among clients in FL scenarios. Previous studies have proposed model optimization, fine-tuning, and personalization to achieve improved model performance. Despite these efforts, models resulting from FL scenarios often exhibit catastrophic forgetting, which increases the communication and computational costs of clients for model optimization and raises energy consumption. To address these challenges, we propose a reference model-based fine-tuning method for federated learning that overcomes catastrophic forgetting in each round. Our method is derived from Bayesian parameter-efficient transfer learning and includes an proximal term. It employs a reference model that incorporates previous model parameters and reviews previous global features in the model optimization step to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. As a result, our method achieves higher model performance and lower communication and computational costs for clients than existing methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Timescale Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Unified Behavior and Control of Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23771v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly used in autonomous driving (AD) and shows clear advantages. However, most RL-based AD methods overlook policy structure design. An RL policy that only outputs short-timescale vehicle control commands results in fluctuating driving behavior due to fluctuations in network outputs, while one that only outputs long-timescale driving goals cannot achieve unified optimality of driving behavior and control. Therefore, we propose a multi-timescale hierarchical reinforcement learning approach. Our approach adopts a hierarchical policy structure, where high- and low-level RL policies are unified-trained to produce long-timescale motion guidance and short-timescale control commands, respectively. Therein, motion guidance is explicitly represented by hybrid actions to capture multimodal driving behaviors on structured road and support incremental low-level extend-state updates. Additionally, a hierarchical safety mechanism is designed to ensure multi-timescale safety. Evaluation in simulator-based and HighD dataset-based highway multi-lane scenarios demonstrates that our approach significantly improves AD performance, effectively increasing driving efficiency, action consistency and safety.</description>

      <title>Visual Anagrams Reveal Hidden Differences in Holistic Shape Processing Across Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00493v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans are able to recognize objects based on both local texture cues and the configuration of object parts, yet contemporary vision models primarily harvest local texture cues, yielding brittle, non-compositional features. Work on shape-vs-texture bias has pitted shape and texture representations in opposition, measuring shape relative to texture, ignoring the possibility that models (and humans) can simultaneously rely on both types of cues, and obscuring the absolute quality of both types of representation. We therefore recast shape evaluation as a matter of absolute configural competence, operationalized by the Configural Shape Score (CSS), which (i) measures the ability to recognize both images in Object-Anagram pairs that preserve local texture while permuting global part arrangement to depict different object categories. Across 86 convolutional, transformer, and hybrid models, CSS (ii) uncovers a broad spectrum of configural sensitivity with fully self-supervised and language-aligned transformers -- exemplified by DINOv2, SigLIP2 and EVA-CLIP -- occupying the top end of the CSS spectrum. Mechanistic probes reveal that (iii) high-CSS networks depend on long-range interactions: radius-controlled attention masks abolish performance showing a distinctive U-shaped integration profile, and representational-similarity analyses expose a mid-depth transition from local to global coding. A BagNet control remains at chance (iv), ruling out "border-hacking" strategies. Finally, (v) we show that configural shape score also predicts other shape-dependent evals. Overall, we propose that the path toward truly robust, generalizable, and human-like vision systems may not lie in forcing an artificial choice between shape and texture, but rather in architectural and learning frameworks that seamlessly integrate both local-texture and global configural shape.</description>

Abstract: Large-scale clinical databases offer opportunities for medical research, but their complexity creates barriers to effective use. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV), one of the world's largest open-source electronic health record databases, traditionally requires both SQL proficiency and clinical domain expertise. We introduce M3, a system that enables natural language querying of MIMIC-IV data through the Model Context Protocol. With a single command, M3 retrieves MIMIC-IV from PhysioNet, launches a local SQLite instance or connects to hosted BigQuery, and allows researchers to pose clinical questions in plain English. We evaluated M3 using one hundred questions from the EHRSQL 2024 benchmark with two language models: the proprietary Claude Sonnet 4 achieved 94% accuracy, while the open-source gpt-oss-20B (deployable locally on consumer hardware) achieved 93% accuracy. Both models translate natural language into SQL, execute queries against MIMIC-IV, and return structured results alongside the underlying query for verification. Error analysis revealed that most failures stemmed from complex temporal reasoning or ambiguous question phrasing rather than fundamental architectural limitations. The comparable performance of a smaller open-source model demonstrates that privacy-preserving local deployment is viable for sensitive clinical data analysis. M3 lowers technical barriers to critical care data analysis while maintaining security through OAuth2 authentication, query validation, and comprehensive audit logging.</description>

      <title>SynTwins: A Retrosynthesis-Guided Framework for Synthesizable Molecular Analog Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The disconnect between AI-generated molecules with desirable properties and their synthetic feasibility remains a critical bottleneck in computational discovery of drugs and materials. While generative AI has accelerated the proposal of candidate molecules, many of these structures prove challenging or impossible to synthesize using established chemical reactions. Here, we introduce SynTwins, a novel retrosynthesis-guided molecule design framework that finds synthetically accessible molecular analogs by emulating expert chemists' strategies in three steps: retrosynthesis, searching similar building blocks, and virtual synthesis. Using a search algorithm instead of a stochastic data-driven generator, SynTwins outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models at exploring synthetically accessible analogs while maintaining high structural similarity to original target molecules. Furthermore, when integrated into existing molecular property-optimization frameworks, our hybrid approach produces synthetically feasible analogs with minimal loss in property scores. Our comprehensive benchmarking across diverse molecular datasets demonstrates that SynTwins effectively bridges the gap between computational design and experimental synthesis, providing a practical solution for accelerating the discovery of synthesizable molecules with desired properties for a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Backdoors in Conditional Diffusion: Threats to Responsible Synthetic Data Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models achieve high-fidelity image generation from natural language prompts. ControlNets extend these models by enabling conditioning on structural inputs (e.g., edge maps, depth, pose), providing fine-grained control over outputs. Yet their reliance on large, publicly scraped datasets and community fine-tuning makes them vulnerable to data poisoning. We introduce a model-poisoning attack that embeds a covert backdoor into a ControlNet, causing it to produce attacker-specified content when exposed to visual triggers, without textual prompts. Experiments show that poisoning only 1% of the fine-tuning corpus yields a 90-98% attack success rate, while 5% further strengthens the backdoor, all while preserving normal generation quality. To mitigate this risk, we propose clean fine-tuning (CFT): freezing the diffusion backbone and fine-tuning only the ControlNet on a sanitized dataset with a reduced learning rate. CFT lowers attack success rates on held-out data. These results expose a critical security weakness in open-source, ControlNet-guided diffusion pipelines and demonstrate that CFT offers a practical defense for responsible synthetic-data pipelines.</description>

      <title>Classification of autoimmune diseases from Peripheral blood TCR repertoires by multimodal multi-instance learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04981v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires encode critical immunological signatures for autoimmune diseases, yet their clinical application remains limited by sequence sparsity and low witness rates. We developed EAMil, a multi-instance deep learning framework that leverages TCR sequencing data to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with exceptional accuracy. By integrating PrimeSeq feature extraction with ESMonehot encoding and enhanced gate attention mechanisms, our model achieved state-of-the-art performance with AUCs of 98.95% for SLE and 97.76% for RA. EAMil successfully identified disease-associated genes with over 90% concordance with established differential analyses and effectively distinguished disease-specific TCR genes. The model demonstrated robustness in classifying multiple disease categories, utilizing the SLEDAI score to stratify SLE patients by disease severity as well as to diagnose the site of damage in SLE patients, and effectively controlling for confounding factors such as age and gender. This interpretable framework for immune receptor analysis provides new insights for autoimmune disease detection and classification with broad potential clinical applications across immune-mediated conditions.</description>

      <title>Chat with AI: The Surprising Turn of Real-time Video Communication from Human to AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI Video Chat emerges as a new paradigm for Real-time Communication (RTC), where one peer is not a human, but a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This makes interaction between humans and AI more intuitive, as if chatting face-to-face with a real person. However, this poses significant challenges to latency, because the MLLM inference takes up most of the response time, leaving very little time for video streaming. Due to network uncertainty, transmission latency becomes a critical bottleneck preventing AI from being like a real person. To address this, we call for AI-oriented RTC research, exploring the network requirement shift from "humans watching video" to "AI understanding video". We begin by recognizing the main differences between AI Video Chat and traditional RTC. Then, through prototype measurements, we identify that ultra-low bitrate is a key factor for low latency. To reduce bitrate dramatically while maintaining MLLM accuracy, we propose Context-Aware Video Streaming that recognizes the importance of each video region for chat and allocates bitrate almost exclusively to chat-important regions. To evaluate the impact of video streaming quality on MLLM accuracy, we build the first benchmark, named Degraded Video Understanding Benchmark (DeViBench). Finally, we discuss some open questions and ongoing solutions for AI Video Chat. DeViBench is open-sourced at: https://github.com/pku-netvideo/DeViBench.</description>

      <title>CodeAssistBench (CAB): Dataset &amp; Benchmarking for Multi-turn Chat-Based Code Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Programming assistants powered by large language models have improved dramatically, yet existing benchmarks still evaluate them in narrow code-generation settings. Recent efforts such as InfiBench and StackEval rely on Stack Overflow questions and remain limited to single-turn interactions, manually curated data, and isolated snippets rather than full project environments. We introduce CodeAssistBench (CAB), the first benchmark for evaluating multi-turn, project-grounded programming assistance at scale. CAB automatically constructs datasets from GitHub issues tagged as questions, using an LLM-driven pipeline that filters noise, extracts runnable contexts, builds executable containers, and verifies environment correctness. This enables continuous, automated expansion across diverse repositories without manual intervention. Using CAB, we create a testbed of 3,286 real-world issues across 214 repositories, spanning seven languages. Evaluating state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap: while models achieve 70-83% accuracy on Stack Overflow-style questions, they solve only 16.49% of CAB issues from post-training-cutoff repositories. On a manually validated subset of 149 issues, top models such as Claude Sonnet 4.5 reach only 12.08% correctness. These results highlight a fundamental challenge: current LLMs struggle to provide assistance in realistic, project-specific contexts despite strong performance on traditional Q&amp;A benchmarks. CAB provides a scalable, reproducible framework for advancing research in multi-turn, codebase-grounded programming agents. The benchmark and pipeline are fully automated and publicly available at https://github.com/amazon-science/CodeAssistBench/.</description>

      <title>COLI: A Hierarchical Efficient Compressor for Large Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The escalating adoption of high-resolution, large-field-of-view imagery amplifies the need for efficient compression methodologies. Conventional techniques frequently fail to preserve critical image details, while data-driven approaches exhibit limited generalizability. Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) present a promising alternative by learning continuous mappings from spatial coordinates to pixel intensities for individual images, thereby storing network weights rather than raw pixels and avoiding the generalization problem. However, INR-based compression of large images faces challenges including slow compression speed and suboptimal compression ratios. To address these limitations, we introduce COLI (Compressor for Large Images), a novel framework leveraging Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV). First, recognizing that INR-based compression constitutes a training process, we accelerate its convergence through a pretraining-finetuning paradigm, mixed-precision training, and reformulation of the sequential loss into a parallelizable objective. Second, capitalizing on INRs' transformation of image storage constraints into weight storage, we implement Hyper-Compression, a novel post-training technique to substantially enhance compression ratios while maintaining minimal output distortion. Evaluations across two medical imaging datasets demonstrate that COLI consistently achieves competitive or superior PSNR and SSIM metrics at significantly reduced bits per pixel (bpp), while accelerating NeRV training by up to 4 times.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Pre-trained Language Models for Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has demonstrated promising results for various code-related tasks. However, their effectiveness in detecting real-world vulnerabilities remains a critical challenge. While existing empirical studies evaluate PLMs for vulnerability detection (VD), they suffer from data leakage, limited scope, and superficial analysis, hindering the accuracy and comprehensiveness of evaluations. This paper begins by revisiting the common issues in existing research on PLMs for VD through the evaluation pipeline. It then proceeds with an accurate and extensive evaluation of 18 PLMs on high-quality datasets that feature accurate labeling, diverse vulnerability types, and various projects. Specifically, we compare the performance of PLMs under both fine-tuning and prompt engineering, assess their effectiveness and generalizability across various training and testing settings, and analyze their robustness to a series of perturbations.
  Our findings reveal that PLMs incorporating pre-training tasks designed to capture the syntactic and semantic patterns of code outperform both general-purpose PLMs and those solely pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code corpora. However, these models face notable challenges in real-world scenarios, such as difficulties in detecting vulnerabilities with complex dependencies, handling perturbations introduced by code normalization and abstraction, and identifying semantic-preserving vulnerable code transformations. Also, the truncation caused by the limited context windows of PLMs can lead to a non-negligible number of labeling errors, which is overlooked by previous work. This study underscores the importance of thorough evaluations of model performance in practical scenarios and outlines future directions to help enhance the effectiveness of PLMs for realistic VD applications.</description>

      <title>FAIR-Pruner: Leveraging Tolerance of Difference for Flexible Automatic Layer-Wise Neural Network Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network pruning has been widely adopted to reduce the parameter scale of complex neural networks, enabling efficient deployment on resource-limited edge devices. Mainstream pruning methods typically adopt uniform pruning strategies, which tend to cause a substantial performance degradation under high sparsity levels. Recent studies focus on non-uniform layer-wise pruning, but such approaches typically depend on global architecture optimization, which is computational expensive and lacks flexibility. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel method named Flexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, which adaptively determines the sparsity levels of each layer and identifies the units to be pruned. The core of FAIR-Pruner lies in the introduction of a novel indicator, Tolerance of Differences (ToD), designed to balance the importance scores obtained from two complementary perspectives: the architecture-level (Utilization Score) and the task-level (Reconstruction Score). By controlling ToD at preset levels, FAIR-Pruner determines layer-specific thresholds and removes units whose Utilization Scores fall below the corresponding thresholds. Furthermore, by decoupling threshold determination from importance estimation, FAIR-Pruner allows users to flexibly obtain pruned models under varying pruning ratios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAIR-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining higher accuracy even at high compression ratios. Moreover, the ToD based layer-wise pruning ratios can be directly applied to existing powerful importance measurements, thereby improving the performance under uniform-pruning.</description>

      <title>Communicating Plans, Not Percepts: Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination with Embodied World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02912v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), which uses the agent's own policy to simulate future states. A Message Generation Network (MGN) then compresses this plan into a message. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems, while scaling environmental complexity. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Cortical Computation: Manifold Disentanglement and Predictive Dynamics in VCNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their success, modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency, poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. These shortcomings can be traced to a lack of inductive biases that reflect the inherent geometric structure of the visual world. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural and computational principles,which evolved to internalize these structures,may offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision. This paper introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual cortex. VCNet is framed as a geometric framework that emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation for learning disentangled representations, and top-down predictive feedback for representation refinement. We interpret these mechanisms through the lens of geometry and dynamical systems, positing that they guide the learning of structured, low-dimensional neural manifolds. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset, which probes sensitivity to natural textures, and a light field image classification task, which requires processing higher-dimensional visual data. Our results show that VCNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset, surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that integrating high-level neuroscientific principles, viewed through a geometric lens, can lead to more efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing long-standing challenges in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Supervised Dynamic Dimension Reduction with Deep Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of dimension reduction, tailored to improving time series forecasting with high-dimensional predictors. We propose a novel Supervised Deep Dynamic Principal component analysis (SDDP) framework that incorporates the target variable and lagged observations into the factor extraction process. Assisted by a temporal neural network, we construct target-aware predictors by scaling the original predictors in a supervised manner, with larger weights assigned to predictors with stronger forecasting power. A principal component analysis is then performed on the target-aware predictors to extract the estimated SDDP factors. This supervised factor extraction not only improves predictive accuracy in the downstream forecasting task but also yields more interpretable and target-specific latent factors. Building upon SDDP, we propose a factor-augmented nonlinear dynamic forecasting model that unifies a broad family of factor-model-based forecasting approaches. To further demonstrate the broader applicability of SDDP, we extend our studies to a more challenging scenario when the predictors are only partially observable. We validate the empirical performance of the proposed method on several real-world public datasets. The results show that our algorithm achieves notable improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>StepFun-Formalizer: Unlocking the Autoformalization Potential of LLMs through Knowledge-Reasoning Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoformalization aims to translate natural-language mathematical statements into a formal language. While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area, existing methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities for effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language domain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem understanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot identify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to interpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions. To address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training pipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by distilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and another by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by expert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to further fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models exhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal reasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5% on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior general-purpose and specialized models.</description>

      <title>SGDFuse: SAM-Guided Diffusion for High-Fidelity Infrared and Visible Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05264v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks. However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at https://github.com/boshizhang123/SGDFuse.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data Generation and Differential Privacy using Tensor Networks' Matrix Product States (MPS)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data generation is a key technique in modern artificial intelligence, addressing data scarcity, privacy constraints, and the need for diverse datasets in training robust models. In this work, we propose a method for generating privacy-preserving high-quality synthetic tabular data using Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS). We benchmark the MPS-based generative model against state-of-the-art models such as CTGAN, VAE, and PrivBayes, focusing on both fidelity and privacy-preserving capabilities. To ensure differential privacy (DP), we integrate noise injection and gradient clipping during training, enabling privacy guarantees via R\'enyi Differential Privacy accounting. Across multiple metrics analyzing data fidelity and downstream machine learning task performance, our results show that MPS outperforms classical models, particularly under strict privacy constraints. This work highlights MPS as a promising tool for privacy-aware synthetic data generation. By combining the expressive power of tensor network representations with formal privacy mechanisms, the proposed approach offers an interpretable and scalable alternative for secure data sharing. Its structured design facilitates integration into sensitive domains where both data quality and confidentiality are critical.</description>

      <title>Find Them All: Unveiling MLLMs for Versatile Person Re-identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve images of a target person from the gallery set, with wide applications in medical rehabilitation and public security. However, traditional person ReID models are typically uni-modal, resulting in limited generalizability across heterogeneous data modalities. Recently, the emergence of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has shown a promising avenue for addressing this issue. Despite this potential, existing methods merely regard MLLMs as feature extractors or caption generators, leaving their capabilities in person ReID tasks largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark for \underline{\textbf{V}}ersatile \underline{\textbf{P}}erson \underline{\textbf{Re}}-\underline{\textbf{ID}}entification, termed VP-ReID. The benchmark includes 257,310 multi-modal queries and gallery images, covering ten diverse person ReID tasks. In addition, we propose two task-oriented evaluation schemes for MLLM-based person ReID. Extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive versatility, effectiveness, and interpretability of MLLMs in various person ReID tasks. Nevertheless, they also have limitations in handling a few modalities, particularly thermal and infrared data. We hope that VP-ReID can facilitate the community in developing more robust and generalizable cross-modal foundation models for person ReID.</description>

      <title>Why Does Stochastic Gradient Descent Slow Down in Low-Precision Training?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-precision training has become crucial for reducing the computational and memory costs of large-scale deep learning. However, quantizing gradients introduces magnitude shrinkage, which can change how stochastic gradient descent (SGD) converges. In this study, we explore SGD convergence under a gradient shrinkage model, where each stochastic gradient is scaled by a factor \( q_k \in (0,1] \). We show that this shrinkage affect the usual stepsize \( \mu_k \) with an effective stepsize \( \mu_k q_k \), slowing convergence when \( q_{\min} &lt; 1 \). With typical smoothness and bounded-variance assumptions, we prove that low-precision SGD still converges, but at a slower pace set by \( q_{\min} \), and with a higher steady error level due to quantization effects. We analyze theoretically how lower numerical precision slows training by treating it as gradient shrinkage within the standard SGD convergence setup.</description>

      <title>A Rule-Based Approach to Specifying Preferences over Conflicting Facts and Querying Inconsistent Knowledge Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Repair-based semantics have been extensively studied as a means of obtaining meaningful answers to queries posed over inconsistent knowledge bases (KBs). While several works have considered how to exploit a priority relation between facts to select optimal repairs, the question of how to specify such preferences remains largely unaddressed. This motivates us to introduce a declarative rule-based framework for specifying and computing a priority relation between conflicting facts. As the expressed preferences may contain undesirable cycles, we consider the problem of determining when a set of preference rules always yields an acyclic relation, and we also explore a pragmatic approach that extracts an acyclic relation by applying various cycle removal techniques. Towards an end-to-end system for querying inconsistent KBs, we present a preliminary implementation and experimental evaluation of the framework, which employs answer set programming to evaluate the preference rules, apply the desired cycle resolution techniques to obtain a priority relation, and answer queries under prioritized-repair semantics.</description>

      <title>OMGSR: You Only Need One Mid-timestep Guidance for Real-World Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) show promising potential in one-step Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR). Current one-step Real-ISR methods typically inject the low-quality (LQ) image latent representation at the start or end timestep of the DDPM scheduler. Recent studies have begun to note that the LQ image latent and the pre-trained noisy latent representations are intuitively closer at a mid-timestep. However, a quantitative analysis of these latent representations remains lacking. Considering these latent representations can be decomposed into signal and noise, we propose a method based on the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) to pre-compute an average optimal mid-timestep for injection. To better approximate the pre-trained noisy latent representation, we further introduce the Latent Representation Refinement (LRR) loss via a LoRA-enhanced VAE encoder. We also fine-tune the backbone of the DDPM-based generative model using LoRA to perform one-step denoising at the average optimal mid-timestep. Based on these components, we present OMGSR, a GAN-based Real-ISR framework that employs a DDPM-based generative model as the generator and a DINOv3-ConvNeXt model with multi-level discriminator heads as the discriminator. We also propose the DINOv3-ConvNeXt DISTS (Dv3CD) loss, which is enhanced for structural perception at varying resolutions. Within the OMGSR framework, we develop OMGSR-S based on SD2.1-base. An ablation study confirms that our pre-computation strategy and LRR loss significantly improve the baseline. Comparative studies demonstrate that OMGSR-S achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics. Code is available at \hyperlink{Github}{https://github.com/wuer5/OMGSR}.</description>

      <title>Nested-ReFT: Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Model Fine-Tuning via Off-Policy Rollouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advanced reasoning in LLMs on challenging domains like mathematical reasoning can be tackled using verifiable rewards based reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT). In standard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with answers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function. While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance improvements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of generating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the training cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy RL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior model to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model configured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the inference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical analysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with controlled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational efficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and model sizes. Additionally, we explore three variants of bias mitigation to minimize the off-policyness in the gradient updates that allows for maintaining performance that matches the baseline ReFT performance.</description>

      <title>SproutBench: A Benchmark for Safe and Ethical Large Language Models for Youth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in applications targeting children and adolescents necessitates a fundamental reassessment of prevailing AI safety frameworks, which are largely tailored to adult users and neglect the distinct developmental vulnerabilities of minors. This paper highlights key deficiencies in existing LLM safety benchmarks, including their inadequate coverage of age-specific cognitive, emotional, and social risks spanning early childhood (ages 0--6), middle childhood (7--12), and adolescence (13--18). To bridge these gaps, we introduce SproutBench, an innovative evaluation suite comprising 1,283 developmentally grounded adversarial prompts designed to probe risks such as emotional dependency, privacy violations, and imitation of hazardous behaviors. Through rigorous empirical evaluation of 47 diverse LLMs, we uncover substantial safety vulnerabilities, corroborated by robust inter-dimensional correlations (e.g., between Safety and Risk Prevention) and a notable inverse relationship between Interactivity and Age Appropriateness. These insights yield practical guidelines for advancing child-centric AI design and deployment.</description>

      <title>TBGRecall: A Generative Retrieval Model for E-commerce Recommendation Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommendation systems are essential tools in modern e-commerce, facilitating personalized user experiences by suggesting relevant products. Recent advancements in generative models have demonstrated potential in enhancing recommendation systems; however, these models often exhibit limitations in optimizing retrieval tasks, primarily due to their reliance on autoregressive generation mechanisms. Conventional approaches introduce sequential dependencies that impede efficient retrieval, as they are inherently unsuitable for generating multiple items without positional constraints within a single request session. To address these limitations, we propose TBGRecall, a framework integrating Next Session Prediction (NSP), designed to enhance generative retrieval models for e-commerce applications. Our framework reformulation involves partitioning input samples into multi-session sequences, where each sequence comprises a session token followed by a set of item tokens, and then further incorporate multiple optimizations tailored to the generative task in retrieval scenarios. In terms of training methodology, our pipeline integrates limited historical data pre-training with stochastic partial incremental training, significantly improving training efficiency and emphasizing the superiority of data recency over sheer data volume. Our extensive experiments, conducted on public benchmarks alongside a large-scale industrial dataset from TaoBao, show TBGRecall outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation methods, and exhibits a clear scaling law trend. Ultimately, NSP represents a significant advancement in the effectiveness of generative recommendation systems for e-commerce applications.</description>

      <title>Mutually Assured Deregulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have convinced ourselves that the way to make AI safe is to make it unsafe. Since 2022, policymakers worldwide have embraced the Regulation Sacrifice - the belief that dismantling safety oversight will deliver security through AI dominance. Fearing China or USA will gain advantage, nations rush to eliminate safeguards that might slow progress. This Essay reveals the fatal flaw: though AI poses national security challenges, the solution demands stronger regulatory frameworks, not weaker ones. A race without guardrails breeds shared danger, not competitive strength. The Regulation Sacrifice makes three false promises. First, it promises durable technological leads. But AI capabilities spread rapidly - performance gaps between U.S. and Chinese systems collapsed from 9 percent to 2 percent in thirteen months. When advantages evaporate in months, sacrificing permanent safety for temporary speed makes no sense. Second, it promises deregulation accelerates innovation. The opposite often proves true. Companies report well-designed governance streamlines development. Investment flows toward regulated markets. Clear rules reduce uncertainty; uncertain liability creates paralysis. Environmental standards did not kill the auto industry; they created Tesla and BYD. Third, enhanced national security through deregulation actually undermines security across all timeframes. Near term: it hands adversaries information warfare tools. Medium term: it democratizes bioweapon capabilities. Long term: it guarantees deployment of uncontrollable AGI systems. The Regulation Sacrifice persists because it serves powerful interests, not security. Tech companies prefer freedom to accountability. Politicians prefer simple stories to complex truths. This creates mutually assured deregulation, where each nation's sprint for advantage guarantees collective vulnerability. The only way to win is not to play.</description>

Abstract: The deep Kolmogorov method is a simple and popular deep learning based method for approximating solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) of the Kolmogorov type. In this work we provide an error analysis for the deep Kolmogorov method for heat PDEs. Specifically, we reveal convergence with convergence rates for the overall mean square distance between the exact solution of the heat PDE and the realization function of the approximating deep neural network (DNN) associated with a stochastic optimization algorithm in terms of the size of the architecture (the depth/number of hidden layers and the width of the hidden layers) of the approximating DNN, in terms of the number of random sample points used in the loss function (the number of input-output data pairs used in the loss function), and in terms of the size of the optimization error made by the employed stochastic optimization method.</description>

      <title>Warm Chat: Diffuse Emotion-aware Interactive Talking Head Avatar with Tree-Structured Guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models have advanced rapidly, enabling impressive talking head generation that brings AI to life. However, most existing methods focus solely on one-way portrait animation. Even the few that support bidirectional conversational interactions lack precise emotion-adaptive capabilities, significantly limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose Warm Chat, a novel emotion-aware talking head generation framework for dyadic interactions. Leveraging the dialogue generation capability of large language models (LLMs, e.g., GPT-4), our method produces temporally consistent virtual avatars with rich emotional variations that seamlessly transition between speaking and listening states. Specifically, we design a Transformer-based head mask generator that learns temporally consistent motion features in a latent mask space, capable of generating arbitrary-length, temporally consistent mask sequences to constrain head motions. Furthermore, we introduce an interactive talking tree structure to represent dialogue state transitions, where each tree node contains information such as child/parent/sibling nodes and the current character's emotional state. By performing reverse-level traversal, we extract rich historical emotional cues from the current node to guide expression synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Learning Primitive Embodied World Models: Towards Scalable Robotic Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4) decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that, unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over 98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize generated samples and the generation process: https://scaffold.deepexploration.org/</description>

      <title>PsychiatryBench: A Multi-Task Benchmark for LLMs in Psychiatry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential in enhancing psychiatric practice, from improving diagnostic accuracy to streamlining clinical documentation and therapeutic support. However, existing evaluation resources heavily rely on small clinical interview corpora, social media posts, or synthetic dialogues, which limits their clinical validity and fails to capture the full complexity of diagnostic reasoning. In this work, we introduce PsychiatryBench, a rigorously curated benchmark grounded exclusively in authoritative, expert-validated psychiatric textbooks and casebooks. PsychiatryBench comprises eleven distinct question-answering tasks ranging from diagnostic reasoning and treatment planning to longitudinal follow-up, management planning, clinical approach, sequential case analysis, and multiple-choice/extended matching formats totaling 5,188 expert-annotated items. {\color{red}We evaluate a diverse set of frontier LLMs (including Google Gemini, DeepSeek, Sonnet 4.5, and GPT 5) alongside leading open-source medical models such as MedGemma using both conventional metrics and an "LLM-as-judge" similarity scoring framework. Our results reveal substantial gaps in clinical consistency and safety, particularly in multi-turn follow-up and management tasks, underscoring the need for specialized model tuning and more robust evaluation paradigms. PsychiatryBench offers a modular, extensible platform for benchmarking and improving LLM performance in mental health applications.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: Aligning Knowledge Bases with User Needs to Enhance Mental Health Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Access to reliable mental health information is vital for early help-seeking, yet expanding knowledge bases is resource-intensive and often misaligned with user needs. This results in poor performance of retrieval systems when presented concerns are not covered or expressed in informal or contextualized language. We present an AI-based gap-informed framework for corpus augmentation that authentically identifies underrepresented topics (gaps) by overlaying naturalistic user data such as forum posts in order to prioritize expansions based on coverage and usefulness. In a case study, we compare Directed (gap-informed augmentations) with Non-Directed augmentation (random additions), evaluating the relevance and usefulness of retrieved information across four retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines. Directed augmentation achieved near-optimal performance with modest expansions--requiring only a 42% increase for Query Transformation, 74% for Reranking and Hierarchical, and 318% for Baseline--to reach ~95% of the performance of an exhaustive reference corpus. In contrast, Non-Directed augmentation required substantially larger and thus practically infeasible expansions to achieve comparable performance (232%, 318%, 403%, and 763%, respectively). These results show that strategically targeted corpus growth can reduce content creation demands while sustaining high retrieval and provision quality, offering a scalable approach for building trusted health information repositories and supporting generative AI applications in high-stakes domains.</description>

      <title>KANO: Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Kolmogorov--Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), a dual-domain neural operator jointly parameterized by both spectral and spatial bases with intrinsic symbolic interpretability. We theoretically demonstrate that KANO overcomes the pure-spectral bottleneck of Fourier Neural Operator (FNO): KANO remains expressive over generic position-dependent dynamics (variable coefficient PDEs) for any physical input, whereas FNO stays practical only for spectrally sparse operators and strictly imposes a fast-decaying input Fourier tail. We verify our claims empirically on position-dependent differential operators, for which KANO robustly generalizes but FNO fails to. In the quantum Hamiltonian learning benchmark, KANO reconstructs ground-truth Hamiltonians in closed-form symbolic representations accurate to the fourth decimal place in coefficients and attains $\approx 6\times10^{-6}$ state infidelity from projective measurement data, substantially outperforming that of the FNO trained with ideal full wave function data, $\approx 1.5\times10^{-2}$, by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Assessment of deep learning models integrated with weather and environmental variables for wildfire spread prediction and a case study of the 2023 Maui fires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the spread of wildfires is essential for effective fire management and risk assessment. With the fast advancements of artificial intelligence (AI), various deep learning models have been developed and utilized for wildfire spread prediction. However, there is limited understanding of the advantages and limitations of these models, and it is also unclear how deep learning-based fire spread models can be compared with existing non-AI fire models. In this work, we assess the ability of five typical deep learning models integrated with weather and environmental variables for wildfire spread prediction based on over ten years of wildfire data in the state of Hawaii. We further use the 2023 Maui fires as a case study to compare the best deep learning models with a widely-used fire spread model, FARSITE. The results show that two deep learning models, i.e., ConvLSTM and ConvLSTM with attention, perform the best among the five tested AI models. FARSITE shows higher precision, lower recall, and higher F1-score than the best AI models, while the AI models offer higher flexibility for the input data. By integrating AI models with an explainable AI method, we further identify important weather and environmental factors associated with the 2023 Maui wildfires.</description>

      <title>KV-Efficient VLA: A Method to Speed up Vision Language Models with RNN-Gated Chunked KV Cache</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a unified framework for robotic perception and control, but their ability to scale to real-world, long-horizon tasks is limited by the high computational cost of attention and the large memory required for storing key-value (KV) pairs during inference, particularly when retaining historical image tokens as context. Recent methods have focused on scaling backbone architectures to improve generalization, with less emphasis on addressing inference inefficiencies essential for real-time use. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a model-agnostic memory compression approach designed to address these limitations by introducing a lightweight mechanism to selectively retain high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed-size chunks and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter the historical context according to learned utility scores. This design aims to preserve recent fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory. Based on experiments, our approach can yield an average of 24.6% FLOPs savings, 1.34x inference speedup, and 1.87x reduction in KV memory. Our method integrates seamlessly into recent VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying downstream control logic.</description>

      <title>Provable Scaling Laws of Feature Emergence from Learning Dynamics of Grokking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21519v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been studied extensively, it remains an open problem whether there is a mathematical framework that characterizes what kind of features will emerge, how and in which conditions it happens, and is closely related to the gradient dynamics of the training, for complex structured inputs. We propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li}_2$, that captures three key stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature learning. At the lazy learning stage, top layer overfits to random hidden representation and the model appears to memorize. Thanks to lazy learning and weight decay, the backpropagated gradient $G_F$ from the top layer now carries information about the target label, with a specific structure that enables each hidden node to learn their representation independently. Interestingly, the independent dynamics follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. When hidden nodes start to interact in the later stage of learning, we provably show how $G_F$ changes to focus on missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of feature emergence, memorization and generalization, and reveals why recent optimizers such as Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our analysis can be extended to multi-layers. The code is available at https://github.com/yuandong-tian/understanding/tree/main/ssl/real-dataset/cogo.</description>

      <title>Boundary on the Table: Efficient Black-Box Decision-Based Attacks for Structured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial robustness in structured data remains an underexplored frontier compared to vision and language domains. In this work, we introduce a novel black-box, decision-based adversarial attack tailored for tabular data. Our approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary search, enabling efficient navigation of discrete and continuous feature spaces under minimal oracle access. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method successfully compromises nearly the entire test set across diverse models, ranging from classical machine learning classifiers to large language model (LLM)-based pipelines. Remarkably, the attack achieves success rates consistently above 90%, while requiring only a small number of queries per instance. These results highlight the critical vulnerability of tabular models to adversarial perturbations, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses in real-world decision-making systems.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Tweedie Discrete Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While diffusion models excel at generating continuous data such as images, adapting them to discrete tasks has relied on indirect approaches that either operate in continuous embedding spaces or use token masking mechanisms, both of which deviate from modeling the true discrete data distribution that can be theoretically guaranteed by Tweedie's formula. We propose in-situ Tweedie Discrete Diffusion (TDD), a framework that performs diffusion guaranteed by Tweedie's formula directly within the discrete one-hot space, hence "in-situ." Unlike prior methods that diffuse continuous embeddings or mask tokens, TDD directly corrupts one-hot vectors with Gaussian noise and performs iterative denoising through a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy objective rather than mean-squared-error reconstruction. At each denoising step, the model predicts class probabilities, applies argmax to obtain discrete predictions, converts them to one-hot vectors, and feeds them into the next iteration with progressively reduced noise. This process naturally unifies discriminative classification and generative modeling under a single framework. Experiments demonstrate that TDD achieves strong performance on both image classification and text generation tasks, with extensive ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of each design component. Our work establishes a principled approach to discrete diffusion that preserves the core characteristics of diffusion models while operating natively in discrete space.</description>

      <title>Time-To-Inconsistency: A Survival Analysis of Large Language Model Robustness to Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments, failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present a large-scale survival analysis of conversational robustness, modeling failure as a time-to-event process over 36,951 turns from 9 state-of-the-art LLMs on the MT-Consistency benchmark. Our framework combines Cox proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time (AFT), and Random Survival Forest models with simple semantic drift features. We find that abrupt prompt-to-prompt semantic drift sharply increases the hazard of inconsistency, whereas cumulative drift is counterintuitively \emph{protective}, suggesting adaptation in conversations that survive multiple shifts. AFT models with model-drift interactions achieve the best combination of discrimination and calibration, and proportional hazards checks reveal systematic violations for key drift covariates, explaining the limitations of Cox-style modeling in this setting. Finally, we show that a lightweight AFT model can be turned into a turn-level risk monitor that flags most failing conversations several turns before the first inconsistent answer while keeping false alerts modest. These results establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm for evaluating multi-turn robustness and for designing practical safeguards for conversational AI systems.</description>

      <title>Constraint Satisfaction Approaches to Wordle: Novel Heuristics and Cross-Lexicon Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02855v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wordle presents an algorithmically rich testbed for constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) solving. While existing solvers rely on information-theoretic entropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint treatment, we present the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with novel constraint-aware solving strategies. We introduce CSP-Aware Entropy, computing information gain after constraint propagation rather than on raw candidate sets, and a Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian word-frequency priors with logical constraints. Through evaluation on 2,315 English words, CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9% success rate, a statistically significant 1.7% improvement over Forward Checking (t=-4.82, p&lt;0.001, Cohen's d=0.07) with 46% faster runtime (12.9ms versus 23.7ms per guess). Under 10% noise, CSP-aware approaches maintain 5.3 percentage point advantages (29.0% versus 23.7%, p=0.041), while Probabilistic CSP achieves 100% success across all noise levels (0-20%) through constraint recovery mechanisms. Cross-lexicon validation on 500 Spanish words demonstrates 88% success with zero language-specific tuning, validating that core CSP principles transfer across languages despite an 11.2 percentage point gap from linguistic differences (p&lt;0.001, Fisher's exact test). Our open-source implementation with 34 unit tests achieving 91% code coverage provides reproducible infrastructure for CSP research. The combination of formal CSP treatment, constraint-aware heuristics, probabilistic-logical integration, robustness analysis, and cross-lexicon validation establishes new performance benchmarks demonstrating that principled constraint satisfaction techniques outperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for structured puzzle-solving domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale foundation models demonstrate strong performance across language, vision, and reasoning tasks. However, how they internally structure and stabilize concepts remains elusive. Inspired by causal inference, we introduce the MindCraft framework built upon Concept Trees. By applying spectral decomposition at each layer and linking principal directions into branching Concept Paths, Concept Trees reconstruct the hierarchical emergence of concepts, revealing exactly when they diverge from shared representations into linearly separable subspaces. Empirical evaluations across diverse scenarios across disciplines, including medical diagnosis, physics reasoning, and political decision-making, show that Concept Trees recover semantic hierarchies, disentangle latent concepts, and can be widely applied across multiple domains. The Concept Tree establishes a widely applicable and powerful framework that enables in-depth analysis of conceptual representations in deep models, marking a significant step forward in the foundation of interpretable AI.</description>

      <title>ALMAS: an Autonomous LLM-based Multi-Agent Software Engineering Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have been leading the way in applied LLM research across a number of fields. One notable area is software development, where researchers have advanced the automation of code implementation, code testing, code maintenance, inter alia, using LLM agents. However, software development is a multifaceted environment that extends beyond just code. As such, a successful LLM system must factor in multiple stages of the software development life-cycle (SDLC). In this paper, we propose a vision for ALMAS, an Autonomous LLM-based Multi-Agent Software Engineering framework, which follows the above SDLC philosophy such that it may work within an agile software development team to perform several tasks end-to-end. ALMAS aligns its agents with agile roles, and can be used in a modular fashion to seamlessly integrate with human developers and their development environment. We showcase the progress towards ALMAS through our published works and a use case demonstrating the framework, where ALMAS is able to seamlessly generate an application and add a new feature.</description>

      <title>Beyond Token Length: Step Pruner for Efficient and Accurate Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate strong performance on complex tasks but often suffer from excessive verbosity, known as "overthinking." Existing solutions via reinforcement learning (RL) typically penalize generated tokens to promote conciseness. However, these methods encounter two challenges: responses with fewer tokens do not always correspond to fewer reasoning steps, and models may develop hacking behavior in later stages of training by discarding reasoning steps to minimize token usage. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Step Pruner (SP)}, an RL framework that steers LRMs toward more efficient reasoning by favoring compact reasoning steps. Our step-aware reward function prioritizes correctness while imposing penalties for redundant steps, and withholds rewards for incorrect responses to prevent the reinforcement of erroneous reasoning. Moreover, we propose a dynamic stopping mechanism: when the model's output no longer shortens, training is halted to prevent hacking behavior caused by the merging of steps. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing response length. For instance, on AIME24, SP reduces token usage by \textbf{69.7\%}.</description>

      <title>Drift No More? Context Equilibria in Multi-Turn LLM Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns. Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\tau$-Bench, measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators. Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together, these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and emerging agentic frameworks are beginning to transform single-cell biology by enabling natural-language reasoning, generative annotation, and multimodal data integration. However, progress remains fragmented across data modalities, architectures, and evaluation standards. LLM4Cell presents the first unified survey of 58 foundation and agentic models developed for single-cell research, spanning RNA, ATAC, multi-omic, and spatial modalities. We categorize these methods into five families-foundation, text-bridge, spatial, multimodal, epigenomic, and agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation, trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness, privacy, and explainability. By linking datasets, models, and evaluation domains, LLM4Cell provides the first integrated view of language-driven single-cell intelligence and outlines open challenges in interpretability, standardization, and trustworthy model development.</description>

      <title>A Novel Framework for Augmenting Rating Scale Tests with LLM-Scored Text Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Psychological assessments are dominated by rating scales, which cannot capture the nuance in natural language. Efforts to supplement them with qualitative text have relied on labelled datasets or expert rubrics, limiting scalability. We introduce a framework that avoids this reliance: large language models (LLMs) score free-text responses with simple prompts to produce candidate LLM items, from which we retain those that yield the most test information when co-calibrated with a baseline scale. Using depression as a case study, we developed and tested the method in upper-secondary students (n=693) and a matched synthetic dataset (n=3,000). Results on held-out test sets showed that augmenting a 19-item scale with LLM items improved its precision, accuracy, and convergent validity. Further, the test information gain matched that of adding as many as 16 rating-scale items. This framework leverages the increasing availability of transcribed language to enhance psychometric measures, with applications in clinical health and beyond.</description>

      <title>MSCloudCAM: Multi-Scale Context Adaptation with Convolutional Cross-Attention for Multispectral Cloud Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clouds remain a major obstacle in optical satellite imaging, limiting accurate environmental and climate analysis. To address the strong spectral variability and the large scale differences among cloud types, we propose MSCloudCAM, a novel multi-scale context adapter network with convolution based cross-attention tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud segmentation. A key contribution of MSCloudCAM is the explicit modeling of multiple complementary multi-scale context extractors. And also, rather than simply stacking or concatenating their outputs, our formulation uses one extractor's fine-resolution features and the other extractor's global contextual representations enabling dynamic, scale-aware feature selection. Building on this idea, we design a new convolution-based cross attention adapter that effectively fuses localized, detailed information with broader multi-scale context. Integrated with a hierarchical vision backbone and refined through channel and spatial attention mechanisms, MSCloudCAM achieves strong spectral-spatial discrimination. Experiments on various multisensor datatsets e.g. CloudSEN12 (Sentinel-2) and L8Biome (Landsat-8) show that MSCloudCAM outperforms recent state-of-the-art models while maintaining competitive model complexity, highlighting the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed design for large-scale Earth observation.</description>

      <title>Reversing the Lens: Using Explainable AI to Understand Human Expertise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Both humans and machine learning models learn from experience, particularly in safety- and reliability-critical domains. While psychology seeks to understand human cognition, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) develops methods to interpret machine learning models. This study bridges these domains by applying computational tools from XAI to analyze human learning. We modeled human behavior during a complex real-world task -- tuning a particle accelerator -- by constructing graphs of operator subtasks. Applying techniques such as community detection and hierarchical clustering to archival operator data, we reveal how operators decompose the problem into simpler components and how these problem-solving structures evolve with expertise. Our findings illuminate how humans develop efficient strategies in the absence of globally optimal solutions, and demonstrate the utility of XAI-based methods for quantitatively studying human cognition.</description>

      <title>AI Debaters are More Persuasive when Arguing in Alignment with Their Own Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically, arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in language models.</description>

      <title>ReefNet: A Large scale, Taxonomically Enriched Dataset and Benchmark for Hard Coral Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coral reefs are rapidly declining due to anthropogenic pressures such as climate change, underscoring the urgent need for scalable, automated monitoring. We introduce ReefNet, a large public coral reef image dataset with point-label annotations mapped to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). ReefNet aggregates imagery from 76 curated CoralNet sources and an additional site from Al Wajh in the Red Sea, totaling approximately 925000 genus-level hard coral annotations with expert-verified labels. Unlike prior datasets, which are often limited by size, geography, or coarse labels and are not ML-ready, ReefNet offers fine-grained, taxonomically mapped labels at a global scale to WoRMS. We propose two evaluation settings: (i) a within-source benchmark that partitions each source's images for localized evaluation, and (ii) a cross-source benchmark that withholds entire sources to test domain generalization. We analyze both supervised and zero-shot classification performance on ReefNet and find that while supervised within-source performance is promising, supervised performance drops sharply across domains, and performance is low across the board for zero-shot models, especially for rare and visually similar genera. This provides a challenging benchmark intended to catalyze advances in domain generalization and fine-grained coral classification. We will release our dataset, benchmarking code, and pretrained models to advance robust, domain-adaptive, global coral reef monitoring and conservation.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of UNet-based Architectures for Liver Tumor Segmentation in Multi-Phase Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25522v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+ with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights. Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance. ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of 0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Robust Graph Condensation via Classification Complexity Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity. Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth, low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the limitation of evaluating machine unlearning using only a single training seed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically. Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model training. We illustrate that this is particularly relevant for MU methods that are deterministic, i.e., which always produce the same result when started from the same trained model. We therefore recommend that empirical comparisons of MU algorithms should also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.</description>

      <title>FOCUS: Efficient Keyframe Selection for Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however, inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments. We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then selecting top-scoring frames within each region. On two long-video question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20 minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/FOCUS.</description>

      <title>Neural Transparency: Mechanistic Interpretability Interfaces for Anticipating Model Behaviors for Personalized AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millions of users now design personalized LLM-based chatbots that shape their daily interactions, yet they can only roughly anticipate how their design choices will manifest as behaviors in deployment. This opacity is consequential: seemingly innocuous prompts can trigger excessive sycophancy, toxicity, or other undesirable traits, degrading utility and raising safety concerns. To address this issue, we introduce an interface that enables neural transparency by exposing language model internals during chatbot design. Our approach extracts behavioral trait vectors (empathy, toxicity, sycophancy, etc.) by computing differences in neural activations between contrastive system prompts that elicit opposing behaviors. We predict chatbot behaviors by projecting the system prompt's final token activations onto these trait vectors, normalizing for cross-trait comparability, and visualizing results via an interactive sunburst diagram. To evaluate this approach, we conducted an online user study using Prolific to compare our neural transparency interface against a baseline chatbot interface without any form of transparency. Our analyses suggest that users systematically miscalibrated AI behavior: participants misjudged trait activations for eleven of fifteen analyzable traits, motivating the need for transparency tools in everyday human-AI interaction. While our interface did not change design iteration patterns, it significantly increased user trust and was enthusiastically received. Qualitative analysis revealed nuanced user experiences with the visualization, suggesting interface and interaction improvements for future work. This work offers a path for how mechanistic interpretability can be operationalized for non-technical users, establishing a foundation for safer, more aligned human-AI interactions.</description>

      <title>Node Preservation and its Effect on Crossover in Cartesian Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While crossover is a critical and often indispensable component in other forms of Genetic Programming, such as Linear- and Tree-based, it has consistently been claimed that it deteriorates search performance in CGP. As a result, a mutation-alone $(1+\lambda)$ evolutionary strategy has become the canonical approach for CGP. Although several operators have been developed that demonstrate an increased performance over the canonical method, a general solution to the problem is still lacking. In this paper, we compare basic crossover methods, namely one-point and uniform, to variants in which nodes are ``preserved,'' including the subgraph crossover developed by Roman Kalkreuth, the difference being that when ``node preservation'' is active, crossover is not allowed to break apart instructions. We also compare a node mutation operator to the traditional point mutation; the former simply replaces an entire node with a new one. We find that node preservation in both mutation and crossover improves search using symbolic regression benchmark problems, moving the field towards a general solution to CGP crossover.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02162v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in 3D generative AI have enabled the creation of physical objects from text prompts, but challenges remain in creating objects involving multiple component types. We present a pipeline that integrates 3D generative AI with vision-language models (VLMs) to enable the robotic assembly of multi-component objects from natural language. Our method leverages VLMs for zero-shot, multi-modal reasoning about geometry and functionality to decompose AI-generated meshes into multi-component 3D models using predefined structural and panel components. We demonstrate that a VLM is capable of determining which mesh regions need panel components in addition to structural components, based on the object's geometry and functionality. Evaluation across test objects shows that users preferred the VLM-generated assignments 90.6% of the time, compared to 59.4% for rule-based and 2.5% for random assignment. Lastly, the system allows users to refine component assignments through conversational feedback, enabling greater human control and agency in making physical objects with generative AI and robotics.</description>

      <title>PRAGMA: A Profiling-Reasoned Multi-Agent Framework for Automatic Kernel Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing high-performance kernels requires expert-level tuning and a deep understanding of hardware characteristics. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled automated kernel generation, yet most existing systems rely solely on correctness or execution time feedback, lacking the ability to reason about low-level performance bottlenecks. In this paper, we introduce PRAGMA, a profile-guided AI kernel generation framework that integrates execution feedback and fine-grained hardware profiling into the reasoning loop. PRAGMA enables LLMs to identify performance bottlenecks, preserve historical best versions, and iteratively refine code quality. We evaluate PRAGMA on KernelBench, covering GPU and CPU backends. Results show that PRAGMA consistently outperforms baseline AIKG without profiling enabled and achieves 2.81$\times$ and 2.30$\times$ averaged speedups against Torch on CPU and GPU platforms, respectively.</description>

      <title>Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment from LDCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) inherently captures both pulmonary and cardiac structures, offering a unique opportunity for joint assessment of lung and cardiovascular health. However, most existing approaches treat these domains as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and shared imaging biomarkers. We propose an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning Framework that enables interpretable cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a single LDCT scan. The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes structural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic cardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically grounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines. Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms. Overall, this work establishes a unified and explainable paradigm for cardiovascular analysis from LDCT, bridging the gap between image-based prediction and mechanism-based medical interpretation.</description>

      <title>DeepRWCap: Neural-Guided Random-Walk Capacitance Solver for IC Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo random walk methods are widely used in capacitance extraction for their mesh free formulation and inherent parallelism. However, modern semiconductor technologies with densely packed structures present significant challenges in unbiasedly sampling transition domains in walk steps with multiple high contrast dielectric materials. We present DeepRWCap, a machine learning guided random walk solver that predicts the transition quantities required to guide each step of the walk. These include Poisson kernels, gradient kernels, and the signs and magnitudes of weights. DeepRWCap employs a two stage neural architecture that decomposes structured outputs into face wise distributions and spatial kernels on cube faces. It uses 3D convolutional networks to capture volumetric dielectric interactions and 2D depthwise separable convolutions to model localized kernel behavior. The design incorporates grid based positional encodings and structural design choices informed by cube symmetries to reduce learning redundancy and improve generalization. Trained on 100000 procedurally generated dielectric configurations, DeepRWCap achieves a mean relative error of 1.24 +/- 0.53% when benchmarked against the commercial Raphael solver on the self capacitance estimation of 10 industrial designs spanning 12 to 55 nm nodes. Compared to the state of the art stochastic difference method Microwalk, DeepRWCap achieves an average speedup of 23%. On complex designs with runtimes over 10 seconds, it reaches an average acceleration of 49%.</description>

      <title>Differentiated Directional Intervention A Framework for Evading LLM Safety Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06852v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safety alignment instills in Large Language Models (LLMs) a critical capacity to refuse malicious requests. Prior works have modeled this refusal mechanism as a single linear direction in the activation space. We posit that this is an oversimplification that conflates two functionally distinct neural processes: the detection of harm and the execution of a refusal. In this work, we deconstruct this single representation into a Harm Detection Direction and a Refusal Execution Direction. Leveraging this fine-grained model, we introduce Differentiated Bi-Directional Intervention (DBDI), a new white-box framework that precisely neutralizes the safety alignment at critical layer. DBDI applies adaptive projection nullification to the refusal execution direction while suppressing the harm detection direction via direct steering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBDI outperforms prominent jailbreaking methods, achieving up to a 97.88\% attack success rate on models such as Llama-2. By providing a more granular and mechanistic framework, our work offers a new direction for the in-depth understanding of LLM safety alignment.</description>

      <title>How do data owners say no? A case study of data consent mechanisms in web-scraped vision-language AI training datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The internet has become the main source of data to train modern text-to-image or vision-language models, yet it is increasingly unclear whether web-scale data collection practices for training AI systems adequately respect data owners' wishes. Ignoring the owner's indication of consent around data usage not only raises ethical concerns but also has recently been elevated into lawsuits around copyright infringement cases. In this work, we aim to reveal information about data owners' consent to AI scraping and training, and study how it's expressed in DataComp, a popular dataset of 12.8 billion text-image pairs. We examine both the sample-level information, including the copyright notice, watermarking, and metadata, and the web-domain-level information, such as a site's Terms of Service (ToS) and Robots Exclusion Protocol. We estimate at least 122M of samples exhibit some indication of copyright notice in CommonPool, and find that 60\% of the samples in the top 50 domains come from websites with ToS that prohibit scraping. Furthermore, we estimate 9-13\% with 95\% confidence interval of samples from CommonPool to contain watermarks, where existing watermark detection methods fail to capture them in high fidelity. Our holistic methods and findings show that data owners rely on various channels to convey data consent, of which current AI data collection pipelines do not entirely respect. These findings highlight the limitations of the current dataset curation/release practice and the need for a unified data consent framework taking AI purposes into consideration.</description>

      <title>AirCopBench: A Benchmark for Multi-drone Collaborative Embodied Perception and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.</description>

      <title>Algorithms Trained on Normal Chest X-rays Can Predict Health Insurance Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is revealing what medicine never intended to encode. Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.67 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal persists even when age, race, and sex are controlled for, and remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data. By uncovering how models perceive and exploit these hidden social signatures, this work reframes fairness in medical AI: the goal is no longer only to balance datasets or adjust thresholds, but to interrogate and disentangle the social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.</description>

      <title>Inferring response times of perceptual decisions with Poisson variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many properties of perceptual decision making are well-modeled by deep neural networks. However, such architectures typically treat decisions as instantaneous readouts, overlooking the temporal dynamics of the decision process. We present an image-computable model of perceptual decision making in which choices and response times arise from efficient sensory encoding and Bayesian decoding of neural spiking activity. We use a Poisson variational autoencoder to learn unsupervised representations of visual stimuli in a population of rate-coded neurons, modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson processes. A task-optimized decoder then continually infers an approximate posterior over actions conditioned on incoming spiking activity. Combining these components with an entropy-based stopping rule yields a principled and image-computable model of perceptual decisions capable of generating trial-by-trial patterns of choices and response times. Applied to MNIST digit classification, the model reproduces key empirical signatures of perceptual decision making, including stochastic variability, right-skewed response time distributions, logarithmic scaling of response times with the number of alternatives (Hick's law), and speed-accuracy trade-offs.</description>

      <title>ImAgent: A Unified Multimodal Agent Framework for Test-Time Scalable Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating visually realistic and semantically coherent images. However, they still suffer from randomness and inconsistency with the given prompts, particularly when textual descriptions are vague or underspecified. Existing approaches, such as prompt rewriting, best-of-N sampling, and self-refinement, can mitigate these issues but usually require additional modules and operate independently, hindering test-time scaling efficiency and increasing computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single framework for efficient test-time scaling. Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models. Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks demonstrate that ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and even surpasses other strong baselines where the backbone model fails, highlighting the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.</description>

      <title>Beyond Superficial Forgetting: Thorough Unlearning through Knowledge Density Estimation and Block Re-insertion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning, which selectively removes harmful knowledge from a pre-trained model without retraining from scratch, is crucial for addressing privacy, regulatory compliance, and ethical concerns in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing unlearning methods often struggle to thoroughly remove harmful knowledge, leaving residual harmful knowledge that can be easily recovered. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge Density-Guided Unlearning via Blocks Reinsertion (KUnBR), a novel approach that first identifies layers with rich harmful knowledge and then thoroughly eliminates the harmful knowledge via re-insertion strategy. Our method introduces knowledge density estimation to quantify and locate layers containing the most harmful knowledge, enabling precise unlearning. Additionally, we design a layer re-insertion strategy that extracts and re-inserts harmful knowledge-rich layers into the original LLM, bypassing gradient obstruction caused by cover layers and ensuring effective gradient propagation during unlearning. Extensive experiments conducted on several unlearning and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that KUnBR achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance while maintaining model utility.</description>

      <title>Mesh-based Super-resolution of Detonation Flows with Multiscale Graph Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12041v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Super-resolution flow reconstruction using state-of-the-art data-driven techniques is valuable for a variety of applications, such as subgrid/subfilter closure modeling, accelerating spatiotemporal forecasting, data compression, and serving as an upscaling tool for sparse experimental measurements. In the present work, a first-of-its-kind multiscale graph transformer approach is developed for mesh-based super-resolution (SR-GT) of reacting flows. The novel data-driven modeling paradigm leverages a graph-based flow-field representation compatible with complex geometries and non-uniform/unstructured grids. Further, the transformer backbone captures long-range dependencies between different parts of the low-resolution flow-field, identifies important features, and then generates the super-resolved flow-field that preserves those features at a higher resolution. The performance of SR-GT is demonstrated in the context of spectral-element-discretized meshes for a challenging test problem of 2D detonation propagation within a premixed hydrogen-air mixture exhibiting highly complex multiscale reacting flow behavior. The SR-GT framework utilizes a unique element + neighborhood graph representation for the coarse input, which is then tokenized before being processed by the transformer component to produce the fine output. It is demonstrated that SR-GT provides high super-resolution accuracy for reacting flow-field features and superior performance compared to traditional interpolation-based SR schemes.</description>

      <title>Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni: Scaling Language-Centric Omnimodal Large Model with Advanced MoE, Training and Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Uni-MoE 2.0 from the Lychee family. As a fully open-source omnimodal large model (OLM), it substantially advances Lychee's Uni-MoE series in language-centric multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generating. Based on the dense LLM, we build Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech. Architecturally, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer. For training, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning. Data-wise, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues. Extensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves SOTA or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%). It also advances long-form speech processing (reducing WER by 4.2%) and leads in low-level image processing and controllable generation across 5 metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Specifying informative and dense reward functions remains a pivotal challenge in Reinforcement Learning, as it directly affects the efficiency of agent training. In this work, we harness the expressive power of quantitative Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (($\text{LTL}_f[\mathcal{F}]$)) to synthesize reward monitors that generate a dense stream of rewards for runtime-observable state trajectories. By providing nuanced feedback during training, these monitors guide agents toward optimal behaviour and help mitigate the well-known issue of sparse rewards under long-horizon decision making, which arises under the Boolean semantics dominating the current literature. Our framework is algorithm-agnostic and only relies on a state labelling function, and naturally accommodates specifying non-Markovian properties. Empirical results show that our quantitative monitors consistently subsume and, depending on the environment, outperform Boolean monitors in maximizing a quantitative measure of task completion and in reducing convergence time.</description>

      <title>FoleyBench: A Benchmark For Video-to-Audio Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video-to-audio generation (V2A) is of increasing importance in domains such as film post-production, AR/VR, and sound design, particularly for the creation of Foley sound effects synchronized with on-screen actions. Foley requires generating audio that is both semantically aligned with visible events and temporally aligned with their timing. Yet, there is a mismatch between evaluation and downstream applications due to the absence of a benchmark tailored to Foley-style scenarios. We find that 74% of videos from past evaluation datasets have poor audio-visual correspondence. Moreover, they are dominated by speech and music, domains that lie outside the use case for Foley. To address this gap, we introduce FoleyBench, the first large-scale benchmark explicitly designed for Foley-style V2A evaluation. FoleyBench contains 5,000 (video, ground-truth audio, text caption) triplets, each featuring visible sound sources with audio causally tied to on-screen events. The dataset is built using an automated, scalable pipeline applied to in-the-wild internet videos from YouTube-based and Vimeo-based sources. Compared to past datasets, we show that videos from FoleyBench have stronger coverage of sound categories from a taxonomy specifically designed for Foley sound. Each clip is further labeled with metadata capturing source complexity, UCS/AudioSet category, and video length, enabling fine-grained analysis of model performance and failure modes. We benchmark several state-of-the-art V2A models, evaluating them on audio quality, audio-video alignment, temporal synchronization, and audio-text consistency. Samples are available at: https://gclef-cmu.org/foleybench</description>

      <title>Beyond SELECT: A Comprehensive Taxonomy-Guided Benchmark for Real-World Text-to-SQL Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL datasets are essential for training and evaluating text-to-SQL models, but existing datasets often suffer from limited coverage and fail to capture the diversity of real-world applications. To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy for text-to-SQL classification based on dimensions including core intents, statement types, syntax structures, and key actions. Using this taxonomy, we evaluate widely used public text-to-SQL datasets (e.g., Spider and Bird) and reveal limitations in their coverage and diversity. We then introduce a taxonomy-guided dataset synthesis pipeline, yielding a new dataset named SQL-Synth. This approach combines the taxonomy with Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure the dataset reflects the breadth and complexity of real-world text-to-SQL applications. Extensive analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness of our taxonomy, as SQL-Synth exhibits greater diversity and coverage compared to existing benchmarks. Moreover, we uncover that existing LLMs typically fall short in adequately capturing the full range of scenarios, resulting in limited performance on SQL-Synth. However, fine-tuning can substantially improve their performance in these scenarios. The proposed taxonomy has significant potential impact, as it not only enables comprehensive analysis of datasets and the performance of different LLMs, but also guides the construction of training data for LLMs.</description>

      <title>Alpha Divergence Losses for Biometric Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Performance in face and speaker verification is largely driven by margin-based softmax losses such as CosFace and ArcFace. Recently introduced $\alpha$-divergence loss functions offer a compelling alternative, particularly due to their ability to induce sparse solutions (when $\alpha&gt;1$). However, integrating an angular margin-crucial for verification tasks-is not straightforward. We find that this integration can be achieved in at least two distinct ways: via the reference measure (prior probabilities) or via the logits (unnormalized log-likelihoods). In this paper, we explore both pathways, deriving two novel margin-based $\alpha$-divergence losses: Q-Margin (margin in the reference measure) and A3M (margin in the logits). We identify and address a training instability in A3M-caused by sparsity-with a simple yet effective prototype re-initialization strategy. Our methods achieve significant performance gains on the challenging IJB-B and IJB-C face verification benchmarks. We demonstrate similarly strong performance in speaker verification on VoxCeleb. Crucially, our models significantly outperform strong baselines at low false acceptance rates (FAR). This capability is critical for practical high-security applications, such as banking authentication, when minimizing false authentications is paramount. Finally, the sparsity of $\alpha$-divergence-based posteriors enables memory-efficient training, which is crucial for datasets with millions of identities.</description>

      <title>Live-SWE-agent: Can Software Engineering Agents Self-Evolve on the Fly?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping almost all industries, including software engineering. In recent years, a number of LLM agents have been proposed to solve real-world software problems. Such software agents are typically equipped with a suite of coding tools and can autonomously decide the next actions to form complete trajectories to solve end-to-end software tasks. While promising, they typically require dedicated design and may still be suboptimal, since it can be extremely challenging and costly to exhaust the entire agent scaffold design space. Recognizing that software agents are inherently software themselves that can be further refined/modified, researchers have proposed a number of self-improving software agents recently, including the Darwin-G\"odel Machine (DGM). Meanwhile, such self-improving agents require costly offline training on specific benchmarks and may not generalize well across different LLMs or benchmarks. In this paper, we propose Live-SWE-agent, the first live software agent that can autonomously and continuously evolve itself on-the-fly during runtime when solving real-world software problems. More specifically, Live-SWE-agent starts with the most basic agent scaffold with only access to bash tools (e.g., mini-SWE-agent), and autonomously evolves its own scaffold implementation while solving real-world software problems. Our evaluation on the widely studied SWE-bench Verified benchmark shows that LIVE-SWE-AGENT can achieve an impressive solve rate of 77.4% without test-time scaling, outperforming all existing software agents, including the best proprietary solution. Moreover, Live-SWE-agent outperforms state-of-the-art manually crafted software agents on the recent SWE-Bench Pro benchmark, achieving the best-known solve rate of 45.8%.</description>

      <title>CascadedViT: Cascaded Chunk-FeedForward and Cascaded Group Attention Vision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a range of computer vision tasks; however, their high computational, memory, and energy demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose \emph{Cascaded-ViT (CViT)}, a lightweight and compute-efficient vision transformer architecture featuring a novel feedforward network design called \emph{Cascaded-Chunk Feed Forward Network (CCFFN)}. By splitting input features, CCFFN improves parameter and FLOP efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that our \emph{CViT-XL} model achieves 75.5\% Top-1 accuracy while reducing FLOPs by 15\% and energy consumption by 3.3\% compared to EfficientViT-M5. Across various model sizes, the CViT family consistently exhibits the lowest energy consumption, making it suitable for deployment on battery-constrained devices such as mobile phones and drones. Furthermore, when evaluated using a new metric called \emph{Accuracy-Per-FLOP (APF)}, which quantifies compute efficiency relative to accuracy, CViT models consistently achieve top-ranking efficiency. Particularly, CViT-L is 2.2\% more accurate than EfficientViT-M2 while having comparable APF scores.</description>

      <title>AdaTok: Adaptive Token Compression with Object-Aware Representations for Efficient Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated substantial value in unified text-image understanding and reasoning, primarily by converting images into sequences of patch-level tokens that align with their architectural paradigm. However, patch-level tokenization leads to a quadratic growth in image tokens, burdening MLLMs' understanding and reasoning with enormous computation and memory. Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system. The experiments are conducted on multiple comprehensive benchmarks, which show that our approach averagely, utilizes only 10% tokens while achieving almost 96% of the vanilla model's performance. More extensive experimental results in comparison with relevant works demonstrate the superiority of our method in balancing compression ratio and performance. Our code will be available.</description>

      <title>LiveCLKTBench: Towards Reliable Evaluation of Cross-Lingual Knowledge Transfer in Multilingual LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating cross-lingual knowledge transfer in large language models is challenging, as correct answers in a target language may arise either from genuine transfer or from prior exposure during pre-training. We present LiveCLKTBench, an automated generation pipeline specifically designed to isolate and measure cross-lingual knowledge transfer. Our pipeline identifies self-contained, time-sensitive knowledge entities from real-world domains, filters them based on temporal occurrence, and verifies them against the model's knowledge. The documents of these valid entities are then used to generate factual questions, which are translated into multiple languages to evaluate transferability across linguistic boundaries. Using LiveCLKTBench, we evaluate several LLMs across five languages and observe that cross-lingual transfer is strongly influenced by linguistic distance and often asymmetric across language directions. While larger models improve transfer, the gains diminish with scale and vary across domains. These findings provide new insights into multilingual transfer and demonstrate the value of LiveCLKTBench as a reliable benchmark for future research.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Expert Quantization for Scalable Mixture-of-Experts Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale LLM capacity efficiently, but deployment on consumer GPUs is limited by the large memory footprint of inactive experts. Static post-training quantization reduces storage costs but cannot adapt to shifting activation patterns, causing accuracy loss under aggressive compression. So we present DynaExq, a runtime system that treats expert precision as a first-class, dynamically managed resource. DynaExq combines (1) a hotness-aware precision controller that continuously aligns expert bit-widths with long-term activation statistics, (2) a fully asynchronous precision-switching pipeline that overlaps promotion and demotion with MoE computation, and (3) a fragmentation-free memory pooling mechanism that supports hybrid-precision experts with deterministic allocation. Together, these components enable stable, non-blocking precision transitions under strict HBM budgets.
  Across Qwen3-30B and Qwen3-80B MoE models and six representative benchmarks, DynaExq deploys large LLMs on single RTX 5090 and A6000 GPUs and improves accuracy by up to 4.03 points over static low-precision baselines. The results show that adaptive, workload-aware quantization is an effective strategy for memory-constrained MoE serving.</description>

      <title>Reasoning via Video: The First Evaluation of Video Models' Reasoning Abilities through Maze-Solving Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video Models have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity video generation with coherent motion dynamics. Analogous to the development from text generation to text-based reasoning in language modeling, the development of video models motivates us to ask: Can video models reason via video generation? Compared with the discrete text corpus, video grounds reasoning in explicit spatial layouts and temporal continuity, which serves as an ideal substrate for spatial reasoning. In this work, we explore the reasoning via video paradigm and introduce VR-Bench -- a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate video models' reasoning capabilities. Grounded in maze-solving tasks that inherently require spatial planning and multi-step reasoning, VR-Bench contains 7,920 procedurally generated videos across five maze types and diverse visual styles. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that SFT can efficiently elicit the reasoning ability of video model. Video models exhibit stronger spatial perception during reasoning, outperforming leading VLMs and generalizing well across diverse scenarios, tasks, and levels of complexity. We further discover a test-time scaling effect, where diverse sampling during inference improves reasoning reliability by 10--20%. These findings highlight the unique potential and scalability of reasoning via video for spatial reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Aspect Cross-modal Quantization for Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in recommender systems. This approach relies on quantized representations to discretize item features, modeling users' historical interactions as sequences of discrete tokens. Based on these tokenized sequences, GR predicts the next item by employing next-token prediction methods. The challenges of GR lie in constructing high-quality semantic identifiers (IDs) that are hierarchically organized, minimally conflicting, and conducive to effective generative model training. However, current approaches remain limited in their ability to harness multimodal information and to capture the deep and intricate interactions among diverse modalities, both of which are essential for learning high-quality semantic IDs and for effectively training GR models. To address this, we propose Multi-Aspect Cross-modal quantization for generative Recommendation (MACRec), which introduces multimodal information and incorporates it into both semantic ID learning and generative model training from different aspects. Specifically, we first introduce cross-modal quantization during the ID learning process, which effectively reduces conflict rates and thus improves codebook usability through the complementary integration of multimodal information. In addition, to further enhance the generative ability of our GR model, we incorporate multi-aspect cross-modal alignments, including the implicit and explicit alignments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three well-known recommendation datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Can MLLMs Detect Phishing? A Comprehensive Security Benchmark Suite Focusing on Dynamic Threats and Multimodal Evaluation in Academic Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has introduced unprecedented security challenges, particularly in phishing detection within academic environments. Academic institutions and researchers are high-value targets, facing dynamic, multilingual, and context-dependent threats that leverage research backgrounds, academic collaborations, and personal information to craft highly tailored attacks. Existing security benchmarks largely rely on datasets that do not incorporate specific academic background information, making them inadequate for capturing the evolving attack patterns and human-centric vulnerability factors specific to academia. To address this gap, we present AdapT-Bench, a unified methodological framework and benchmark suite for systematically evaluating MLLM defense capabilities against dynamic phishing attacks in academic settings.</description>

      <title>PresentCoach: Dual-Agent Presentation Coaching through Exemplars and Interactive Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective presentation skills are essential in education, professional communication, and public speaking, yet learners often lack access to high-quality exemplars or personalized coaching. Existing AI tools typically provide isolated functionalities such as speech scoring or script generation without integrating reference modeling and interactive feedback into a cohesive learning experience. We introduce a dual-agent system that supports presentation practice through two complementary roles: the Ideal Presentation Agent and the Coach Agent. The Ideal Presentation Agent converts user-provided slides into model presentation videos by combining slide processing, visual-language analysis, narration script generation, personalized voice synthesis, and synchronized video assembly. The Coach Agent then evaluates user-recorded presentations against these exemplars, conducting multimodal speech analysis and delivering structured feedback in an Observation-Impact-Suggestion (OIS) format. To enhance the authenticity of the learning experience, the Coach Agent incorporates an Audience Agent, which simulates the perspective of a human listener and provides humanized feedback reflecting audience reactions and engagement. Together, these agents form a closed loop of observation, practice, and feedback. Implemented on a robust backend with multi-model integration, voice cloning, and error handling mechanisms, the system demonstrates how AI-driven agents can provide engaging, human-centered, and scalable support for presentation skill development in both educational and professional contexts.</description>

      <title>CompTrack: Information Bottleneck-Guided Low-Rank Dynamic Token Compression for Point Cloud Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15580v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D single object tracking (SOT) in LiDAR point clouds is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous driving. Despite great success having been achieved, the inherent sparsity of point clouds introduces a dual-redundancy challenge that limits existing trackers: (1) vast spatial redundancy from background noise impairs accuracy, and (2) informational redundancy within the foreground hinders efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose CompTrack, a novel end-to-end framework that systematically eliminates both forms of redundancy in point clouds. First, CompTrack incorporates a Spatial Foreground Predictor (SFP) module to filter out irrelevant background noise based on information entropy, addressing spatial redundancy. Subsequently, its core is an Information Bottleneck-guided Dynamic Token Compression (IB-DTC) module that eliminates the informational redundancy within the foreground. Theoretically grounded in low-rank approximation, this module leverages an online SVD analysis to adaptively compress the redundant foreground into a compact and highly informative set of proxy tokens. Extensive experiments on KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that CompTrack achieves top-performing tracking performance with superior efficiency, running at a real-time 90 FPS on a single RTX 3090 GPU.</description>

      <title>The SA-FARI Dataset: Segment Anything in Footage of Animals for Recognition and Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated video analysis is critical for wildlife conservation. A foundational task in this domain is multi-animal tracking (MAT), which underpins applications such as individual re-identification and behavior recognition. However, existing datasets are limited in scale, constrained to a few species, or lack sufficient temporal and geographical diversity - leaving no suitable benchmark for training general-purpose MAT models applicable across wild animal populations. To address this, we introduce SA-FARI, the largest open-source MAT dataset for wild animals. It comprises 11,609 camera trap videos collected over approximately 10 years (2014-2024) from 741 locations across 4 continents, spanning 99 species categories. Each video is exhaustively annotated culminating in ~46 hours of densely annotated footage containing 16,224 masklet identities and 942,702 individual bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and species labels. Alongside the task-specific annotations, we publish anonymized camera trap locations for each video. Finally, we present comprehensive benchmarks on SA-FARI using state-of-the-art vision-language models for detection and tracking, including SAM 3, evaluated with both species-specific and generic animal prompts. We also compare against vision-only methods developed specifically for wildlife analysis. SA-FARI is the first large-scale dataset to combine high species diversity, multi-region coverage, and high-quality spatio-temporal annotations, offering a new foundation for advancing generalizable multianimal tracking in the wild. The dataset is available at https://www.conservationxlabs.com/sa-fari.</description>

      <title>The Loss of Control Playbook: Degrees, Dynamics, and Preparedness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research report addresses the absence of an actionable definition for Loss of Control (LoC) in AI systems by developing a novel taxonomy and preparedness framework. Despite increasing policy and research attention, existing LoC definitions vary significantly in scope and timeline, hindering effective LoC assessment and mitigation. To address this issue, we draw from an extensive literature review and propose a graded LoC taxonomy, based on the metrics of severity and persistence, that distinguishes between Deviation, Bounded LoC, and Strict LoC. We model pathways toward a societal state of vulnerability in which sufficiently advanced AI systems have acquired or could acquire the means to cause Bounded or Strict LoC once a catalyst, either misalignment or pure malfunction, materializes. We argue that this state becomes increasingly likely over time, absent strategic intervention, and propose a strategy to avoid reaching a state of vulnerability. Rather than focusing solely on intervening on AI capabilities and propensities potentially relevant for LoC or on preventing potential catalysts, we introduce a complementary framework that emphasizes three extrinsic factors: Deployment context, Affordances, and Permissions (the DAP framework). Compared to work on intrinsic factors and catalysts, this framework has the unfair advantage of being actionable today. Finally, we put forward a plan to maintain preparedness and prevent the occurrence of LoC outcomes should a state of societal vulnerability be reached, focusing on governance measures (threat modeling, deployment policies, emergency response) and technical controls (pre-deployment testing, control measures, monitoring) that could maintain a condition of perennial suspension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based language models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive generation, yet their reliance on Transformer backbones limits inference efficiency due to quadratic attention and KV-cache overhead. In this work, we introduce DiffuApriel, a masked diffusion language model built on a bidirectional Mamba backbone that combines the diffusion objective with linear-time sequence modeling. DiffuApriel matches the performance of Transformer-based diffusion models while achieving up to 4.4x higher inference throughput for long sequences with a 1.3B model. We further propose DiffuApriel-H, a hybrid variant that interleaves attention and mamba layers, offering up to 2.6x throughput improvement with balanced global and local context modeling. Our results demonstrate that bidirectional state-space architectures serve as strong denoisers in masked diffusion LMs, providing a practical and scalable foundation for faster, memory-efficient text generation.</description>

      <title>Hiding in the AI Traffic: Abusing MCP for LLM-Powered Agentic Red Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15998</link>

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping offensive cybersecurity by enabling autonomous red team agents that can plan, execute, and adapt during penetration tests. However, existing approaches face trade-offs between generality and specialization, and practical deployments reveal challenges such as hallucinations, context limitations, and ethical concerns. In this work, we introduce a novel command &amp; control (C2) architecture leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to coordinate distributed, adaptive reconnaissance agents covertly across networks. Notably, we find that our architecture not only improves goal-directed behavior of the system as whole, but also eliminates key host and network artifacts that can be used to detect and prevent command &amp; control behavior altogether. We begin with a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art generative red teaming methods, from fine-tuned specialist models to modular or agentic frameworks, analyzing their automation capabilities against task-specific accuracy. We then detail how our MCP-based C2 can overcome current limitations by enabling asynchronous, parallel operations and real-time intelligence sharing without periodic beaconing. We furthermore explore advanced adversarial capabilities of this architecture, its detection-evasion techniques, and address dual-use ethical implications, proposing defensive measures and controlled evaluation in lab settings. Experimental comparisons with traditional C2 show drastic reductions in manual effort and detection footprint. We conclude with future directions for integrating autonomous exploitation, defensive LLM agents, predictive evasive maneuvers, and multi-agent swarms. The proposed MCP-enabled C2 framework demonstrates a significant step toward realistic, AI-driven red team operations that can simulate advanced persistent threats while informing the development of next-generation defensive systems.</description>

      <title>Future-Back Threat Modeling: A Foresight-Driven Security Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional threat modeling remains reactive-focused on known TTPs and past incident data, while threat prediction and forecasting frameworks are often disconnected from operational or architectural artifacts. This creates a fundamental weakness: the most serious cyber threats often do not arise from what is known, but from what is assumed, overlooked, or not yet conceived, and frequently originate from the future, such as artificial intelligence, information warfare, and supply chain attacks, where adversaries continuously develop new exploits that can bypass defenses built on current knowledge. To address this mental gap, this paper introduces the theory and methodology of Future-Back Threat Modeling (FBTM). This predictive approach begins with envisioned future threat states and works backward to identify assumptions, gaps, blind spots, and vulnerabilities in the current defense architecture, providing a clearer and more accurate view of impending threats so that we can anticipate their emergence and shape the future we want through actions taken now. The proposed methodology further aims to reveal known unknowns and unknown unknowns, including tactics, techniques, and procedures that are emerging, anticipated, and plausible. This enhances the predictability of adversary behavior, particularly under future uncertainty, helping security leaders make informed decisions today that shape more resilient security postures for the future.</description>

      <title>When Alignment Fails: Multimodal Adversarial Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in embodied environments, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act through unified multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.</description>

      <title>Ellipsoid-Based Decision Boundaries for Open Intent Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Textual open intent classification is crucial for real-world dialogue systems, enabling robust detection of unknown user intents without prior knowledge and contributing to the robustness of the system. While adaptive decision boundary methods have shown great potential by eliminating manual threshold tuning, existing approaches assume isotropic distributions of known classes, restricting boundaries to balls and overlooking distributional variance along different directions. To address this limitation, we propose EliDecide, a novel method that learns ellipsoid decision boundaries with varying scales along different feature directions. First, we employ supervised contrastive learning to obtain a discriminative feature space for known samples. Second, we apply learnable matrices to parameterize ellipsoids as the boundaries of each known class, offering greater flexibility than spherical boundaries defined solely by centers and radii. Third, we optimize the boundaries via a novelly designed dual loss function that balances empirical and open-space risks: expanding boundaries to cover known samples while contracting them against synthesized pseudo-open samples. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple text intent benchmarks and further on a question classification dataset. The flexibility of the ellipsoids demonstrates superior open intent detection capability and strong potential for generalization to more text classification tasks in diverse complex open-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>PairHuman: A High-Fidelity Photographic Dataset for Customized Dual-Person Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalized dual-person portrait customization has considerable potential applications, such as preserving emotional memories and facilitating wedding photography planning. However, the absence of a benchmark dataset hinders the pursuit of high-quality customization in dual-person portrait generation. In this paper, we propose the PairHuman dataset, which is the first large-scale benchmark dataset specifically designed for generating dual-person portraits that meet high photographic standards. The PairHuman dataset contains more than 100K images that capture a variety of scenes, attire, and dual-person interactions, along with rich metadata, including detailed image descriptions, person localization, human keypoints, and attribute tags. We also introduce DHumanDiff, which is a baseline specifically crafted for dual-person portrait generation that features enhanced facial consistency and simultaneously balances in personalized person generation and semantic-driven scene creation. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that our dataset and method produce highly customized portraits with superior visual quality that are tailored to human preferences. Our dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/annaoooo/PairHuman.</description>

      <title>ReBrain: Brain MRI Reconstruction from Sparse CT Slice via Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in brain disease diagnosis, but it is not always feasible for certain patients due to physical or clinical constraints. Recent studies attempt to synthesize MRI from Computed Tomography (CT) scans; however, low-dose protocols often result in highly sparse CT volumes with poor through-plane resolution, making accurate reconstruction of the full brain MRI volume particularly challenging. To address this, we propose ReBrain, a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework for brain MRI reconstruction. Given any 3D CT scan with limited slices, we first employ a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) to synthesize MRI slices along the 2D dimension. Simultaneously, we retrieve structurally and pathologically similar CT slices from a comprehensive prior database via a fine-tuned retrieval model. These retrieved slices are used as references, incorporated through a ControlNet branch to guide the generation of intermediate MRI slices and ensure structural continuity. We further account for rare retrieval failures when the database lacks suitable references and apply spherical linear interpolation to provide supplementary guidance. Extensive experiments on SynthRAD2023 and BraTS demonstrate that ReBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal reconstruction under sparse conditions.</description>

      <title>Beyond Multiple Choice: Verifiable OpenQA for Robust Vision-Language RFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) has been a popular format for evaluating and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) of modern multimodal language models. Its constrained output format allows for simplified, deterministic automatic verification. However, we find that the options may leak exploitable signals, which makes the accuracy metrics unreliable for indicating real capabilities and encourages explicit or implicit answer guessing behaviors during RFT. We propose ReVeL (Rewrite and Verify by LLM), a framework that rewrites multiple-choice questions into open-form questions while keeping answers verifiable whenever possible. The framework categorizes questions according to different answer types, apply different rewriting and verification schemes, respectively. When applied for RFT, we converted 20k MCQA examples and use GRPO to finetune Qwen2.5-VL models. Models trained on ReVeL-OpenQA match MCQA accuracy on multiple-choice benchmarks and improve OpenQA accuracy by about six percentage points, indicating better data efficiency and more robust reward signals than MCQA-based training. When used for evaluation, ReVeL also reveals up to 20 percentage points of score inflation in MCQA benchmarks (relative to OpenQA), improves judging accuracy, and reduces both cost and latency. We will release code and data publicly.</description>

      <title>Preventing Shortcut Learning in Medical Image Analysis through Intermediate Layer Knowledge Distillation from Specialist Teachers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models are prone to learning shortcut solutions to problems using spuriously correlated yet irrelevant features of their training data. In high-risk applications such as medical image analysis, this phenomenon may prevent models from using clinically meaningful features when making predictions, potentially leading to poor robustness and harm to patients. We demonstrate that different types of shortcuts (those that are diffuse and spread throughout the image, as well as those that are localized to specific areas) manifest distinctly across network layers and can, therefore, be more effectively targeted through mitigation strategies that target the intermediate layers. We propose a novel knowledge distillation framework that leverages a teacher network fine-tuned on a small subset of task-relevant data to mitigate shortcut learning in a student network trained on a large dataset corrupted with a bias feature. Through extensive experiments on CheXpert, ISIC 2017, and SimBA datasets using various architectures (ResNet-18, AlexNet, DenseNet-121, and 3D CNNs), we demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional Empirical Risk Minimization, augmentation-based bias-mitigation, and group-based bias-mitigation approaches. In many cases, we achieve comparable performance with a baseline model trained on bias-free data, even on out-of-distribution test data. Our results demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach to real-world medical imaging scenarios where bias annotations are limited and shortcut features are difficult to identify a priori.</description>

      <title>GRAPHIC--Guidelines for Reviewing Algorithmic Practices in Human-centred Design and Interaction for Creativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been increasingly applied to creative domains, leading to the development of systems that collaborate with humans in design processes. In Graphic Design, integrating computational systems into co-creative workflows presents specific challenges, as it requires balancing scientific rigour with the subjective and visual nature of design practice. Following the PRISMA methodology, we identified 872 articles, resulting in a final corpus of 71 publications describing 68 unique systems. Based on this review, we introduce GRAPHIC (Guidelines for Reviewing Algorithmic Practices in Human-centred Design and Interaction for Creativity), a framework for analysing computational systems applied to Graphic Design. Its goal is to understand how current systems support human-AI collaboration in the Graphic Design discipline. The framework comprises main dimensions, which our analysis revealed to be essential across diverse system types: (1) Collaborative Panorama, (2) Processes and Modalities, and (3) Graphic Design Principles. Its application revealed research gaps, including the need to balance initiative and control between agents, improve communication through explainable interaction models, and promote systems that support transformational creativity grounded in core design principles.</description>
