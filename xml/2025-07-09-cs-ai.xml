      <title>LLMs are Capable of Misaligned Behavior Under Explicit Prohibition and Surveillance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, LLMs are tasked with completing an impossible quiz, while they are in a sandbox, monitored, told about these measures and instructed not to cheat. Some frontier LLMs cheat consistently and attempt to circumvent restrictions despite everything. The results reveal a fundamental tension between goal-directed behavior and alignment in current LLMs. The code and evaluation logs are available at github.com/baceolus/cheating_evals</description>

      <title>Discovering Algorithms with Computational Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithms are the engine for reproducible problem-solving. We present a framework automating algorithm discovery by conceptualizing them as sequences of operations, represented as tokens. These computational tokens are chained using a grammar, enabling the formation of increasingly sophisticated procedures. Our ensemble Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) guided by reinforcement learning (RL) explores token chaining and drives the creation of new tokens. This methodology rediscovers, improves, and generates new algorithms that substantially outperform existing methods for strongly NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems and foundational quantum computing approaches such as Grover's and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Operating at the computational rather than code-generation level, our framework produces algorithms that can be tailored specifically to problem instances, not merely classes.</description>

      <title>SI-Agent: An Agentic Framework for Feedback-Driven Generation and Tuning of Human-Readable System Instructions for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: System Instructions (SIs), or system prompts, are pivotal for guiding Large Language Models (LLMs) but manual crafting is resource-intensive and often suboptimal. Existing automated methods frequently generate non-human-readable "soft prompts," sacrificing interpretability. This paper introduces SI-Agent, a novel agentic framework designed to automatically generate and iteratively refine human-readable SIs through a feedback-driven loop. SI-Agent employs three collaborating agents: an Instructor Agent, an Instruction Follower Agent (target LLM), and a Feedback/Reward Agent evaluating task performance and optionally SI readability. The framework utilizes iterative cycles where feedback guides the Instructor's refinement strategy (e.g., LLM-based editing, evolutionary algorithms). We detail the framework's architecture, agent roles, the iterative refinement process, and contrast it with existing methods. We present experimental results validating SI-Agent's effectiveness, focusing on metrics for task performance, SI readability, and efficiency. Our findings indicate that SI-Agent generates effective, readable SIs, offering a favorable trade-off between performance and interpretability compared to baselines. Potential implications include democratizing LLM customization and enhancing model transparency. Challenges related to computational cost and feedback reliability are acknowledged.</description>

      <title>Efficient Knowledge Graph Construction and Retrieval from Unstructured Text for Large-Scale RAG Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scalable and cost-efficient framework for deploying Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in enterprise environments. While GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval, its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable, and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.</description>

      <title>CodeAgents: A Token-Efficient Framework for Codified Multi-Agent Reasoning in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective prompt design is essential for improving the planning capabilities of large language model (LLM)-driven agents. However, existing structured prompting strategies are typically limited to single-agent, plan-only settings, and often evaluate performance solely based on task accuracy - overlooking critical factors such as token efficiency, modularity, and scalability in multi-agent environments. To address these limitations, we introduce CodeAgents, a prompting framework that codifies multi-agent reasoning and enables structured, token-efficient planning in multi-agent systems. In CodeAgents, all components of agent interaction - Task, Plan, Feedback, system roles, and external tool invocations - are codified into modular pseudocode enriched with control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals), boolean logic, and typed variables. This design transforms loosely connected agent plans into cohesive, interpretable, and verifiable multi-agent reasoning programs. We evaluate the proposed framework across three diverse benchmarks - GAIA, HotpotQA, and VirtualHome - using a range of representative LLMs. Results show consistent improvements in planning performance, with absolute gains of 3-36 percentage points over natural language prompting baselines. On VirtualHome, our method achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 56%. In addition, our approach reduces input and output token usage by 55-87% and 41-70%, respectively, underscoring the importance of token-aware evaluation metrics in the development of scalable multi-agent LLM systems.

      <title>GDGB: A Benchmark for Generative Dynamic Text-Attributed Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs (DyTAGs), which intricately integrate structural, temporal, and textual attributes, are crucial for modeling complex real-world systems. However, most of the existing DyTAG datasets exhibit poor textual quality, which severely limits their utility for DyTAG generation tasks requiring semantically rich inputs. Additionally, prior work mainly focuses on discriminative tasks on DyTAGs, resulting in a lack of standardized task formulations and evaluation protocols tailored for DyTAG generation. To address these critical issues, we propose Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), which comprises eight meticulously curated DyTAG datasets with high-quality textual features for both nodes and edges, overcoming limitations of prior datasets. Building on GDGB, we define two novel DyTAG generation tasks: Transductive Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG) and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG). TDGG transductively generates a target DyTAG based on the given source and destination node sets, while the more challenging IDGG introduces new node generation to inductively model the dynamic expansion of real-world graph data. To enable holistic evaluation, we design multifaceted metrics that assess the structural, temporal, and textual quality of the generated DyTAGs. We further propose GAG-General, an LLM-based multi-agent generative framework tailored for reproducible and robust benchmarking of DyTAG generation. Experimental results demonstrate that GDGB enables rigorous evaluation of TDGG and IDGG, with key insights revealing the critical interplay of structural and textual features in DyTAG generation. These findings establish GDGB as a foundational resource for advancing generative DyTAG research and unlocking further practical applications in DyTAG generation. GDGB datasets, source codes, and leaderboards are available at \href{https://gdgb-algo.github.io/}{here}.</description>

      <title>Memory Mosaics at scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory Mosaics [Zhang et al., 2025], networks of associative memories, have demonstrated appealing compositional and in-context learning capabilities on medium-scale networks (GPT-2 scale) and synthetic small datasets. This work shows that these favorable properties remain when we scale memory mosaics to large language model sizes (llama-8B scale) and real-world datasets.
  To this end, we scale memory mosaics to 10B size, we train them on one trillion tokens, we introduce a couple architectural modifications ("Memory Mosaics v2"), we assess their capabilities across three evaluation dimensions: training-knowledge storage, new-knowledge storage, and in-context learning.
  Throughout the evaluation, memory mosaics v2 match transformers on the learning of training knowledge (first dimension) and significantly outperforms transformers on carrying out new tasks at inference time (second and third dimensions). These improvements cannot be easily replicated by simply increasing the training data for transformers. A memory mosaics v2 trained on one trillion tokens still perform better on these tasks than a transformer trained on eight trillion tokens.</description>

      <title>LTLCrit: A Temporal Logic-based LLM Critic for Safe and Efficient Embodied Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in reasoning tasks and general decision-making in static environments. In long-term planning tasks, however, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient behavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a trajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL). Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient behavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety constraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term efficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve as the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules that improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft diamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving efficiency compared to baseline LLM planners. Our results suggest that enabling LLMs to supervise each other through logic is a powerful and flexible paradigm for safe, generalizable decision making.</description>

      <title>NDAI-NeuroMAP: A Neuroscience-Specific Embedding Model for Domain-Specific Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NDAI-NeuroMAP, the first neuroscience-domain-specific dense vector embedding model engineered for high-precision information retrieval tasks. Our methodology encompasses the curation of an extensive domain-specific training corpus comprising 500,000 carefully constructed triplets (query-positive-negative configurations), augmented with 250,000 neuroscience-specific definitional entries and 250,000 structured knowledge-graph triplets derived from authoritative neurological ontologies. We employ a sophisticated fine-tuning approach utilizing the FremyCompany/BioLORD-2023 foundation model, implementing a multi-objective optimization framework combining contrastive learning with triplet-based metric learning paradigms. Comprehensive evaluation on a held-out test dataset comprising approximately 24,000 neuroscience-specific queries demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art general-purpose and biomedical embedding models. These empirical findings underscore the critical importance of domain-specific embedding architectures for neuroscience-oriented RAG systems and related clinical natural language processing applications.</description>

      <title>Exploring Object Status Recognition for Recipe Progress Tracking in Non-Visual Cooking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooking plays a vital role in everyday independence and well-being, yet remains challenging for people with vision impairments due to limited support for tracking progress and receiving contextual feedback. Object status - the condition or transformation of ingredients and tools - offers a promising but underexplored foundation for context-aware cooking support. In this paper, we present OSCAR (Object Status Context Awareness for Recipes), a technical pipeline that explores the use of object status recognition to enable recipe progress tracking in non-visual cooking. OSCAR integrates recipe parsing, object status extraction, visual alignment with cooking steps, and time-causal modeling to support real-time step tracking. We evaluate OSCAR on 173 instructional videos and a real-world dataset of 12 non-visual cooking sessions recorded by BLV individuals in their homes. Our results show that object status consistently improves step prediction accuracy across vision-language models, and reveal key factors that impact performance in real-world conditions, such as implicit tasks, camera placement, and lighting. We contribute the pipeline of context-aware recipe progress tracking, an annotated real-world non-visual cooking dataset, and design insights to guide future context-aware assistive cooking systems.</description>

      <title>Disambiguation-Centric Finetuning Makes Enterprise Tool-Calling LLMs More Realistic and Less Risky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with invoking enterprise APIs, yet they routinely falter when near-duplicate tools vie for the same user intent or when required arguments are left underspecified. We introduce DiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation &amp; Evaluation), a disambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes persona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish among highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source models with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live agentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional static metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE raise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over Claude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling agents.</description>

      <title>Effects of structure on reasoning in instance-level Self-Discover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The drive for predictable LLM reasoning in their integration with compound systems has popularized structured outputs, yet concerns remain about performance trade-offs compared to unconstrained natural language. At the same time, training on unconstrained Chain of Thought (CoT) traces has brought about a new class of strong reasoning models that nevertheless present novel compute budget and faithfulness challenges. This paper introduces iSelf-Discover, an instance-level adaptation of the Self-Discover framework, and using it compares dynamically generated structured JSON reasoning with its unstructured counterpart. Our empirical evaluation across diverse benchmarks using state-of-the-art open-source models supports a consistent advantage for unstructured reasoning. Notably, on the complex MATH benchmark, unstructured plans achieved relative performance improvements of up to 18.90\% over structured approaches. Zero-shot unstructured iSelf-Discover variants are also shown to outperform their five-shot structured counterparts, underscoring the significance of this gap, even when structured plans are dynamically generated to ensure reasoning precedes the final answer. We further demonstrate that the optimal granularity of plan generation (instance-level vs. task-level) is context-dependent. These findings invite re-evaluation of the reliance on structured formats for complex problem-solving and how compound systems should be organized.</description>

      <title>Artificial intelligence in drug discovery: A comprehensive review with a case study on hyperuricemia, gout arthritis, and hyperuricemic nephropathy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper systematically reviews recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), with a particular focus on machine learning (ML), across the entire drug discovery pipeline. Due to the inherent complexity, escalating costs, prolonged timelines, and high failure rates of traditional drug discovery methods, there is a critical need to comprehensively understand how AI/ML can be effectively integrated throughout the full process. Currently available literature reviews often narrowly focus on specific phases or methodologies, neglecting the dependence between key stages such as target identification, hit screening, and lead optimization. To bridge this gap, our review provides a detailed and holistic analysis of AI/ML applications across these core phases, highlighting significant methodological advances and their impacts at each stage. We further illustrate the practical impact of these techniques through an in-depth case study focused on hyperuricemia, gout arthritis, and hyperuricemic nephropathy, highlighting real-world successes in molecular target identification and therapeutic candidate discovery. Additionally, we discuss significant challenges facing AI/ML in drug discovery and outline promising future research directions. Ultimately, this review serves as an essential orientation for researchers aiming to leverage AI/ML to overcome existing bottlenecks and accelerate drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Lessons from a Chimp: AI "Scheming" and the Quest for Ape Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine recent research that asks whether current AI systems may be developing a capacity for "scheming" (covertly and strategically pursuing misaligned goals). We compare current research practices in this field to those adopted in the 1970s to test whether non-human primates could master natural language. We argue that there are lessons to be learned from that historical research endeavour, which was characterised by an overattribution of human traits to other agents, an excessive reliance on anecdote and descriptive analysis, and a failure to articulate a strong theoretical framework for the research. We recommend that research into AI scheming actively seeks to avoid these pitfalls. We outline some concrete steps that can be taken for this research programme to advance in a productive and scientifically rigorous fashion.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Reasoning for Cardiovascular Imaging Phenotype Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the associations between imaging phenotypes and disease risk factors and outcomes is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and improving diagnosis and prognosis models. However, traditional approaches rely on human-driven hypothesis testing and selection of association factors, often overlooking complex, non-linear dependencies among imaging phenotypes and other multi-modal data. To address this, we introduce a Multi-agent Exploratory Synergy for the Heart (MESHAgents) framework that leverages large language models as agents to dynamically elicit, surface, and decide confounders and phenotypes in association studies, using cardiovascular imaging as a proof of concept. Specifically, we orchestrate a multi-disciplinary team of AI agents -- spanning cardiology, biomechanics, statistics, and clinical research -- which spontaneously generate and converge on insights through iterative, self-organizing reasoning. The framework dynamically synthesizes statistical correlations with multi-expert consensus, providing an automated pipeline for phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We demonstrate the system's capabilities through a population-based study of imaging phenotypes of the heart and aorta. MESHAgents autonomously uncovered correlations between imaging phenotypes and a wide range of non-imaging factors, identifying additional confounder variables beyond standard demographic factors. Validation on diagnosis tasks reveals that MESHAgents-discovered phenotypes achieve performance comparable to expert-selected phenotypes, with mean AUC differences as small as -0.004 on disease classification tasks. Notably, the recall score improves for 6 out of 9 disease types. Our framework provides clinically relevant imaging phenotypes with transparent reasoning, offering a scalable alternative to expert-driven methods.</description>

      <title>REAL: Benchmarking Abilities of Large Language Models for Housing Transactions and Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has greatly promoted the progress of chatbot in multiple fields. There is an urgent need to evaluate whether LLMs can play the role of agent in housing transactions and services as well as humans. We present Real Estate Agent Large Language Model Evaluation (REAL), the first evaluation suite designed to assess the abilities of LLMs in the field of housing transactions and services. REAL comprises 5,316 high-quality evaluation entries across 4 topics: memory, comprehension, reasoning and hallucination. All these entries are organized as 14 categories to assess whether LLMs have the knowledge and ability in housing transactions and services scenario. Additionally, the REAL is used to evaluate the performance of most advanced LLMs. The experiment results indicate that LLMs still have significant room for improvement to be applied in the real estate field.</description>

      <title>Limits of Safe AI Deployment: Differentiating Oversight and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oversight and control (collectively, supervision) are often invoked as key levers for ensuring that AI systems are accountable, reliable, and able to fulfill governance and management requirements. However, the concepts are frequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy discourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain under meaningful human supervision.
  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision outside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to AI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and operational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either a policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims to prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection, remediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight strategies nonetheless necessitate control.
  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a theoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the conditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and what is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how supervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management, and drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a maturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some boundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail, and where it is clear that no existing methods suffice. This foregrounds the question of whether meaningful supervision is possible in a given deployment context, and can support regulators, auditors, and practitioners in identifying both present limitations and the need for new conceptual and technical advances.</description>

      <title>A Universal Approach to Feature Representation in Dynamic Task Assignment Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic task assignment concerns the optimal assignment of resources to tasks in a business process. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been proposed as the state of the art for solving assignment problems. DRL methods usually employ a neural network (NN) as an approximator for the policy function, which ingests the state of the process and outputs a valuation of the possible assignments. However, representing the state and the possible assignments so that they can serve as inputs and outputs for a policy NN remains an open challenge, especially when tasks or resources have features with an infinite number of possible values. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a method for representing and solving assignment problems with infinite state and action spaces. In doing so, it provides three contributions: (I) A graph-based feature representation of assignment problems, which we call assignment graph; (II) A mapping from marked Colored Petri Nets to assignment graphs; (III) An adaptation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm that can learn to solve assignment problems represented through assignment graphs. To evaluate the proposed representation method, we model three archetypal assignment problems ranging from finite to infinite state and action space dimensionalities. The experiments show that the method is suitable for representing and learning close-to-optimal task assignment policies regardless of the state and action space dimensionalities.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Vector, Graph and Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipelines for Open Radio Access Networks (ORAN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is expected to play a pivotal role in enabling autonomous optimization in future wireless networks. Within the ORAN architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding. Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study, we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness, answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance by 7%.</description>

      <title>EvoAgentX: An Automated Framework for Evolving Agentic Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for orchestrating large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to collaboratively address complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often require manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic evolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization algorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we present EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation, execution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX employs a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic components, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically, within the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization algorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts, tool configurations, and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on HotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and mathematical problem solving, respectively, and further assess it on real-world tasks using GAIA. Experimental results show that EvoAgentX consistently achieves significant performance improvements, including a 7.44% increase in HotPotQA F1, a 10.00% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00% gain in MATH solve accuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00% on GAIA.

      <description>arXiv:2507.03637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This systematic review explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Combinatorial Optimization (CO). We report our findings using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We conduct a literature search via Scopus and Google Scholar, examining over 2,000 publications. We assess publications against four inclusion and four exclusion criteria related to their language, research focus, publication year, and type. Eventually, we select 103 studies. We classify these studies into semantic categories and topics to provide a comprehensive overview of the field, including the tasks performed by LLMs, the architectures of LLMs, the existing datasets specifically designed for evaluating LLMs in CO, and the field of application. Finally, we identify future directions for leveraging LLMs in this field.</description>

      <title>Towards Machine Theory of Mind with Large Language Model-Augmented Inverse Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid approach to machine Theory of Mind (ToM) that uses large language models (LLMs) as a mechanism for generating hypotheses and likelihood functions with a Bayesian inverse planning model that computes posterior probabilities for an agent's likely mental states given its actions. Bayesian inverse planning models can accurately predict human reasoning on a variety of ToM tasks, but these models are constrained in their ability to scale these predictions to scenarios with a large number of possible hypotheses and actions. Conversely, LLM-based approaches have recently demonstrated promise in solving ToM benchmarks, but can exhibit brittleness and failures on reasoning tasks even when they pass otherwise structurally identical versions. By combining these two methods, this approach leverages the strengths of each component, closely matching optimal results on a task inspired by prior inverse planning models and improving performance relative to models that utilize LLMs alone or with chain-of-thought prompting, even with smaller LLMs that typically perform poorly on ToM tasks. We also exhibit the model's potential to predict mental states on open-ended tasks, offering a promising direction for future development of ToM models and the creation of socially intelligent generative agents.</description>

      <title>Towards Unified Neurosymbolic Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning has received significant attention in the fields of artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering, owing to its ability to autonomously deduce new knowledge and consequently enhance the availability and precision of downstream applications. However, current methods predominantly concentrate on a single form of neural or symbolic reasoning, failing to effectively integrate the inherent strengths of both approaches. Furthermore, the current prevalent methods primarily focus on addressing a single reasoning scenario, presenting limitations in meeting the diverse demands of real-world reasoning tasks. Unifying the neural and symbolic methods, as well as diverse reasoning scenarios in one model is challenging as there is a natural representation gap between symbolic rules and neural networks, and diverse scenarios exhibit distinct knowledge structures and specific reasoning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a unified neurosymbolic reasoning framework, namely Tunsr, for KG reasoning. Tunsr first introduces a consistent structure of reasoning graph that starts from the query entity and constantly expands subsequent nodes by iteratively searching posterior neighbors. Based on it, a forward logic message-passing mechanism is proposed to update both the propositional representations and attentions, as well as first-order logic (FOL) representations and attentions of each node. In this way, Tunsr conducts the transformation of merging multiple rules by merging possible relations at each step. Finally, the FARI algorithm is proposed to induce FOL rules by constantly performing attention calculations over the reasoning graph. Extensive experimental results on 19 datasets of four reasoning scenarios (transductive, inductive, interpolation, and extrapolation) demonstrate the effectiveness of Tunsr.</description>

      <title>Roadmap for using large language models (LLMs) to accelerate cross-disciplinary research with an example from computational biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools transforming how research is conducted. However, their use in research has been met with skepticism, due to concerns about hallucinations, biases and potential harms to research. These emphasize the importance of clearly understanding the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs to ensure their effective and responsible use. Here, we present a roadmap for integrating LLMs into cross-disciplinary research, where effective communication, knowledge transfer and collaboration across diverse fields are essential but often challenging. We examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs and provide a detailed computational biology case study (on modeling HIV rebound dynamics) demonstrating how iterative interactions with an LLM (ChatGPT) can facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and research. We argue that LLMs are best used as augmentative tools within a human-in-the-loop framework. Looking forward, we envisage that the responsible use of LLMs will enhance innovative cross-disciplinary research and substantially accelerate scientific discoveries.</description>

      <title>Agent-Based Detection and Resolution of Incompleteness and Ambiguity in Interactions with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of us now treat LLMs as modern-day oracles asking it almost any kind of question. However, consulting an LLM does not have to be a single turn activity. But long multi-turn interactions can get tedious if it is simply to clarify contextual information that can be arrived at through reasoning. In this paper, we examine the use of agent-based architecture to bolster LLM-based Question-Answering systems with additional reasoning capabilities. We examine the automatic resolution of potential incompleteness or ambiguities in questions by transducers implemented using LLM-based agents. We focus on several benchmark datasets that are known to contain questions with these deficiencies to varying degrees. We equip different LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo and Llama-4-Scout) with agents that act as specialists in detecting and resolving deficiencies of incompleteness and ambiguity. The agents are implemented as zero-shot ReAct agents. Rather than producing an answer in a single step, the model now decides between 3 actions a) classify b) resolve c) answer. Action a) decides if the question is incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. Action b) determines if any deficiencies identified can be resolved. Action c) answers the resolved form of the question. We compare the use of LLMs with and without the use of agents with these components. Our results show benefits of agents with transducer 1) A shortening of the length of interactions with human 2) An improvement in the answer quality and 3) Explainable resolution of deficiencies in the question. On the negative side we find while it may result in additional LLM invocations and in some cases, increased latency. But on tested datasets, the benefits outweigh the costs except when questions already have sufficient context. Suggesting the agent-based approach could be a useful mechanism to harness the power of LLMs to develop more robust QA systems.</description>

Abstract: This article explores an approach to addressing the Close Enough Traveling Salesman Problem (CETSP). The objective is to streamline the mathematical formulation by introducing reformulations that approximate the Euclidean distances and simplify the objective function. Additionally, the use of convex sets in the constraint design offers computational benefits. The proposed methodology is empirically validated on real-world CETSP instances, with the aid of computational strategies such as a fragmented CPLEX-based approach. Results demonstrate its effectiveness in managing computational resources without compromising solution quality. Furthermore, the article analyzes the behavior of the proposed mathematical formulations, providing comprehensive insights into their performance.</description>

      <title>Learning Dark Souls Combat Through Pixel Input With Neuroevolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) to automate gameplay in Dark Souls, a notoriously challenging action role-playing game characterized by complex combat mechanics, dynamic environments, and high-dimensional visual inputs. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning or game playing approaches, our method evolves neural networks directly from raw pixel data, circumventing the need for explicit game-state information. To facilitate this approach, we introduce the Dark Souls API (DSAPI), a novel Python framework leveraging real-time computer vision techniques for extracting critical game metrics, including player and enemy health states. Using NEAT, agents evolve effective combat strategies for defeating the Asylum Demon, the game's initial boss, without predefined behaviors or domain-specific heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate that evolved agents achieve up to a 35% success rate, indicating the viability of neuroevolution in addressing complex, visually intricate gameplay scenarios. This work represents an interesting application of vision-based neuroevolution, highlighting its potential use in a wide range of challenging game environments lacking direct API support or well-defined state representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe GNOME (Generating Novelty in Open-world Multi-agent Environments), an experimental platform that is designed to test the effectiveness of multi-agent AI systems when faced with \emph{novelty}. GNOME separates the development of AI gameplaying agents with the simulator, allowing \emph{unanticipated} novelty (in essence, novelty that is not subject to model-selection bias). Using a Web GUI, GNOME was recently demonstrated at NeurIPS 2020 using the game of Monopoly to foster an open discussion on AI robustness and the nature of novelty in real-world environments. In this article, we further detail the key elements of the demonstration, and also provide an overview of the experimental design that is being currently used in the DARPA Science of Artificial Intelligence and Learning for Open-World Novelty (SAIL-ON) program to evaluate external teams developing novelty-adaptive gameplaying agents.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Tacit Knowledge Discovery in Organizational Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Documenting tacit knowledge in organizations can be a challenging task due to incomplete initial information, difficulty in identifying knowledgeable individuals, the interplay of formal hierarchies and informal networks, and the need to ask the right questions. To address this, we propose an agent-based framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to iteratively reconstruct dataset descriptions through interactions with employees. Modeling knowledge dissemination as a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) process with waning infectivity, we conduct 864 simulations across various synthetic company structures and different dissemination parameters. Our results show that the agent achieves 94.9% full-knowledge recall, with self-critical feedback scores strongly correlating with external literature critic scores. We analyze how each simulation parameter affects the knowledge retrieval process for the agent. In particular, we find that our approach is able to recover information without needing to access directly the only domain specialist. These findings highlight the agent's ability to navigate organizational complexity and capture fragmented knowledge that would otherwise remain inaccessible.</description>

      <title>RELRaE: LLM-Based Relationship Extraction, Labelling, Refinement, and Evaluation</title>

Abstract: A large volume of XML data is produced in experiments carried out by robots in laboratories. In order to support the interoperability of data between labs, there is a motivation to translate the XML data into a knowledge graph. A key stage of this process is the enrichment of the XML schema to lay the foundation of an ontology schema. To achieve this, we present the RELRaE framework, a framework that employs large language models in different stages to extract and accurately label the relationships implicitly present in the XML schema. We investigate the capability of LLMs to accurately generate these labels and then evaluate them. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can be effectively used to support the generation of relationship labels in the context of lab automation, and that they can play a valuable role within semi-automatic ontology generation frameworks more generally.</description>

      <title>Economic Evaluation of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practitioners often navigate LLM performance trade-offs by plotting Pareto frontiers of optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs. However, this approach offers no way to compare between LLMs with distinct strengths and weaknesses: for example, a cheap, error-prone model vs a pricey but accurate one. To address this gap, we propose economic evaluation of LLMs. Our framework quantifies the performance trade-off of an LLM as a single number based on the economic constraints of a concrete use case, all expressed in dollars: the cost of making a mistake, the cost of incremental latency, and the cost of abstaining from a query. We apply our economic evaluation framework to compare the performance of reasoning and non-reasoning models on difficult questions from the MATH benchmark, discovering that reasoning models offer better accuracy-cost tradeoffs as soon as the economic cost of a mistake exceeds \$0.01. In addition, we find that single large LLMs often outperform cascades when the cost of making a mistake is as low as \$0.1. Overall, our findings suggest that when automating meaningful human tasks with AI models, practitioners should typically use the most powerful available model, rather than attempt to minimize AI deployment costs, since deployment costs are likely dwarfed by the economic impact of AI errors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a semantic feedback framework that enables natural language to guide the evolution of artificial life systems. Integrating a prompt-to-parameter encoder, a CMA-ES optimizer, and CLIP-based evaluation, the system allows user intent to modulate both visual outcomes and underlying behavioral rules. Implemented in an interactive ecosystem simulation, the framework supports prompt refinement, multi-agent interaction, and emergent rule synthesis. User studies show improved semantic alignment over manual tuning and demonstrate the system's potential as a platform for participatory generative design and open-ended evolution.</description>

      <title>From Query to Explanation: Uni-RAG for Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Learning in STEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In AI-facilitated teaching, leveraging various query styles to interpret abstract educational content is crucial for delivering effective and accessible learning experiences. However, existing retrieval systems predominantly focus on natural text-image matching and lack the capacity to address the diversity and ambiguity inherent in real-world educational scenarios. To address this limitation, we develop a lightweight and efficient multi-modal retrieval module, named Uni-Retrieval, which extracts query-style prototypes and dynamically matches them with tokens from a continually updated Prompt Bank. This Prompt Bank encodes and stores domain-specific knowledge by leveraging a Mixture-of-Expert Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) module and can be adapted to enhance Uni-Retrieval's capability to accommodate unseen query types at test time. To enable natural language educational content generation, we integrate the original Uni-Retrieval with a compact instruction-tuned language model, forming a complete retrieval-augmented generation pipeline named Uni-RAG. Given a style-conditioned query, Uni-RAG first retrieves relevant educational materials and then generates human-readable explanations, feedback, or instructional content aligned with the learning objective. Experimental results on SER and other multi-modal benchmarks show that Uni-RAG outperforms baseline retrieval and RAG systems in both retrieval accuracy and generation quality, while maintaining low computational cost. Our framework provides a scalable, pedagogically grounded solution for intelligent educational systems, bridging retrieval and generation to support personalized, explainable, and efficient learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Systemic and Environment Errors in Autonomous Systems Using Differential Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When an autonomous agent behaves undesirably, including failure to complete a task, it can be difficult to determine whether the behavior is due to a systemic agent error, such as flaws in the model or policy, or an environment error, where a task is inherently infeasible under a given environment configuration, even for an ideal agent. As agents and their environments grow more complex, identifying the error source becomes increasingly difficult but critical for reliable deployment. We introduce AIProbe, a novel black-box testing technique that applies differential testing to attribute undesirable agent behaviors either to agent deficiencies, such as modeling or training flaws, or due to environmental infeasibility. AIProbe first generates diverse environmental configurations and tasks for testing the agent, by modifying configurable parameters using Latin Hypercube sampling. It then solves each generated task using a search-based planner, independent of the agent. By comparing the agent's performance to the planner's solution, AIProbe identifies whether failures are due to errors in the agent's model or policy, or due to unsolvable task conditions. Our evaluation across multiple domains shows that AIProbe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting both total and unique errors, thereby contributing to a reliable deployment of autonomous agents.</description>

      <title>LLMs model how humans induce logically structured rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central goal of cognitive science is to provide a computationally explicit account of both the structure of the mind and its development: what are the primitive representational building blocks of cognition, what are the rules via which those primitives combine, and where do these primitives and rules come from in the first place? A long-standing debate concerns the adequacy of artificial neural networks as computational models that can answer these questions, in particular in domains related to abstract cognitive function, such as language and logic. This paper argues that recent advances in neural networks -- specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) -- represent an important shift in this debate. We test a variety of LLMs on an existing experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules formulated over logical concepts. Across four experiments, we find converging empirical evidence that LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior as models that implement a Bayesian probablistic language of thought (pLoT), which have been the best computational models of human behavior on the same task. Moreover, we show that the LLMs make qualitatively different predictions about the nature of the rules that are inferred and deployed in order to complete the task, indicating that the LLM is unlikely to be a mere implementation of the pLoT solution. Based on these results, we argue that LLMs may instantiate a novel theoretical account of the primitive representations and computations necessary to explain human logical concepts, with which future work in cognitive science should engage.</description>

      <title>Agent Exchange: Shaping the Future of AI Agent Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed AI agents from passive computational tools into autonomous economic actors. This shift marks the emergence of the agent-centric economy, in which agents take on active economic roles-exchanging value, making strategic decisions, and coordinating actions with minimal human oversight. To realize this vision, we propose Agent Exchange (AEX), a specialized auction platform designed to support the dynamics of the AI agent marketplace. AEX offers an optimized infrastructure for agent coordination and economic participation. Inspired by Real-Time Bidding (RTB) systems in online advertising, AEX serves as the central auction engine, facilitating interactions among four ecosystem components: the User-Side Platform (USP), which translates human goals into agent-executable tasks; the Agent-Side Platform (ASP), responsible for capability representation, performance tracking, and optimization; Agent Hubs, which coordinate agent teams and participate in AEX-hosted auctions; and the Data Management Platform (DMP), ensuring secure knowledge sharing and fair value attribution. We outline the design principles and system architecture of AEX, laying the groundwork for agent-based economic infrastructure in future AI ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Animation Needs Attention: A Holistic Approach to Slides Animation Comprehension with Visual-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slide animations, such as fade-ins, fly-ins, and wipes, are critical for audience engagement, efficient information delivery, and vivid visual expression. However, most AI-driven slide-generation tools still lack native animation support, and existing vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with animation tasks due to the absence of public datasets and limited temporal-reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we release the first public dataset for slide-animation modeling: 12,000 triplets of natural-language descriptions, animation JSON files, and rendered videos, collectively covering every built-in PowerPoint effect. Using this resource, we fine-tune Qwen-2.5-VL-7B with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and achieve consistent improvements over GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Pro in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, SPICE, and our Coverage-Order-Detail Assessment (CODA) metric, which evaluates action coverage, temporal order, and detail fidelity. On a manually curated test set of slides, the LoRA model increases BLEU-4 by around 60%, ROUGE-L by 30%, and shows significant improvements in CODA-detail. This demonstrates that low-rank adaptation enables reliable temporal reasoning and generalization beyond synthetic data. Overall, our dataset, LoRA-enhanced model, and CODA metric provide a rigorous benchmark and foundation for future research on VLM-based dynamic slide generation.</description>

      <title>CortexDebate: Debating Sparsely and Equally for Multi-Agent Debate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, single Large Language Model (LLM) struggles with critical issues such as hallucination and inadequate reasoning abilities. To mitigate these issues, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as an effective strategy, where LLM agents engage in in-depth debates with others on tasks. However, existing MAD methods face two major issues: (a) too lengthy input contexts, which causes LLM agents to get lost in plenty of input information and experiences performance drop; and (b) the overconfidence dilemma, where self-assured LLM agents dominate the debate, leading to low debating effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MAD method called "CortexDebate". Inspired by the human brain's tendency to establish a sparse and dynamically optimized network among cortical areas governed by white matter, CortexDebate constructs a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, where each LLM agent only debates with the ones that are helpful to it. To optimize the graph, we propose a module named McKinsey-based Debate Matter (MDM), which acts as an artificial analog to white matter. By integrating the McKinsey Trust Formula, a well-established measure of trustworthiness from sociology, MDM enables credible evaluations that guide graph optimization. The effectiveness of our CortexDebate has been well demonstrated by extensive experimental results across eight datasets from four task types.</description>

      <title>An ASP-Based Framework for MUSes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an unsatisfiable formula, understanding the core reason for unsatisfiability is crucial in several applications. One effective way to capture this is through the minimal unsatisfiable subset (MUS), the subset-minimal set of clauses that remains unsatisfiable. Current research broadly focuses on two directions: (i) enumerating as many MUSes as possible within a given time limit, and (ii) counting the total number of MUSes for a given unsatisfiable formula.
  In this paper, we introduce an answer set programming-based framework, named MUS-ASP, designed for online enumeration of MUSes. ASP is a powerful tool for its strengths in knowledge representation and is particularly suitable for specifying complex combinatorial problems. By translating MUS enumeration into answer set solving, MUS-ASP leverages the computational efficiency of state-of-the-art ASP systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of MUS-ASP and highlights the acceleration in both MUS enumeration and counting tasks, particularly when integrated within hybrid solvers, including the framework proposed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Toward Better Generalisation in Uncertainty Estimators: Leveraging Data-Agnostic Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses that are factually incorrect yet expressed with high confidence, which can pose serious risks for end users. To address this, it is essential for LLMs not only to produce answers but also to provide accurate estimates of their correctness. Uncertainty quantification methods have been introduced to assess the quality of LLM outputs, with factual accuracy being a key aspect of that quality. Among these methods, those that leverage hidden states to train probes have shown particular promise, as these internal representations encode information relevant to the factuality of responses, making this approach the focus of this paper. However, the probe trained on the hidden states of one dataset often struggles to generalise to another dataset of a different task or domain. To address this limitation, we explore combining data-agnostic features with hidden-state features and assess whether this hybrid feature set enhances out-of-domain performance. We further examine whether selecting only the most informative hidden-state features, thereby discarding task-specific noise, enables the data-agnostic features to contribute more effectively. The experiment results indicate that although introducing data-agnostic features generally enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain scenarios their inclusion degrades performance. A similar pattern emerges when retaining only the most important hidden-state features - adding data-agnostic features does not consistently further enhance performance compared to using the full set of hidden-state features. A closer analysis reveals that, in some specific cases, the trained probe underweights the data-agnostic features relative to the hidden-state features, which we believe is the main reason why the results are inconclusive.</description>

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities across various domains, they still struggle with complex problems characterized by multi-objective optimization, precise constraint satisfaction, immense solution spaces, etc. To address the limitation, drawing on the superior semantic understanding ability of LLMs and also the outstanding global search and optimization capability of genetic algorithms, we propose to capitalize on their respective strengths and introduce Lyria, a general LLM-driven genetic algorithm framework, comprising 7 essential components. Through conducting extensive experiments with 4 LLMs across 3 types of problems, we demonstrated the efficacy of Lyria. Additionally, with 7 additional ablation experiments, we further systematically analyzed and elucidated the factors that affect its performance.</description>

      <title>Ready Jurist One: Benchmarking Language Agents for Legal Intelligence in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gap between static benchmarks and the dynamic nature of real-world legal practice poses a key barrier to advancing legal intelligence. To this end, we introduce J1-ENVS, the first interactive and dynamic legal environment tailored for LLM-based agents. Guided by legal experts, it comprises six representative scenarios from Chinese legal practices across three levels of environmental complexity. We further introduce J1-EVAL, a fine-grained evaluation framework, designed to assess both task performance and procedural compliance across varying levels of legal proficiency. Extensive experiments on 17 LLM agents reveal that, while many models demonstrate solid legal knowledge, they struggle with procedural execution in dynamic settings. Even the SOTA model, GPT-4o, falls short of 60% overall performance. These findings highlight persistent challenges in achieving dynamic legal intelligence and offer valuable insights to guide future research.</description>

      <title>HAWK: A Hierarchical Workflow Framework for Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary multi-agent systems encounter persistent challenges in cross-platform interoperability, dynamic task scheduling, and efficient resource sharing. Agents with heterogeneous implementations often lack standardized interfaces; collaboration frameworks remain brittle and hard to extend; scheduling policies are static; and inter-agent state synchronization is insufficient. We propose Hierarchical Agent Workflow (HAWK), a modular framework comprising five layers-User, Workflow, Operator, Agent, and Resource-and supported by sixteen standardized interfaces. HAWK delivers an end-to-end pipeline covering task parsing, workflow orchestration, intelligent scheduling, resource invocation, and data synchronization. At its core lies an adaptive scheduling and optimization module in the Workflow Layer, which harnesses real-time feedback and dynamic strategy adjustment to maximize utilization. The Resource Layer provides a unified abstraction over heterogeneous data sources, large models, physical devices, and third-party services&amp;tools, simplifying cross-domain information retrieval. We demonstrate HAWK's scalability and effectiveness via CreAgentive, a multi-agent novel-generation prototype, which achieves marked gains in throughput, lowers invocation complexity, and improves system controllability. We also show how hybrid deployments of large language models integrate seamlessly within HAWK, highlighting its flexibility. Finally, we outline future research avenues-hallucination mitigation, real-time performance tuning, and enhanced cross-domain adaptability-and survey prospective applications in healthcare, government, finance, and education.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based web agents have recently made significant progress, but much of it has occurred in closed-source systems, widening the gap with open-source alternatives. Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close the gap with closed-source models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Robustness of LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Systems through Randomized Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a defense framework for enhancing the safety of large language model (LLM) empowered multi-agent systems (MAS) in safety-critical domains such as aerospace. We apply randomized smoothing, a statistical robustness certification technique, to the MAS consensus context, enabling probabilistic guarantees on agent decisions under adversarial influence. Unlike traditional verification methods, our approach operates in black-box settings and employs a two-stage adaptive sampling mechanism to balance robustness and computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our method effectively prevents the propagation of adversarial behaviors and hallucinations while maintaining consensus performance. This work provides a practical and scalable path toward safe deployment of LLM-based MAS in real-world, high-stakes environments.</description>

      <title>A Technical Survey of Reinforcement Learning Techniques for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a transformative approach for aligning and enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing critical challenges in instruction following, ethical alignment, and reasoning capabilities. This survey offers a comprehensive foundation on the integration of RL with language models, highlighting prominent algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Q-Learning, and Actor-Critic methods. Additionally, it provides an extensive technical overview of RL techniques specifically tailored for LLMs, including foundational methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and AI Feedback (RLAIF), as well as advanced strategies such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We systematically analyze their applications across domains, i.e., from code generation to tool-augmented reasoning. We also present a comparative taxonomy based on reward modeling, feedback mechanisms, and optimization strategies. Our evaluation highlights key trends. RLHF remains dominant for alignment, and outcome-based RL such as RLVR significantly improves stepwise reasoning. However, persistent challenges such as reward hacking, computational costs, and scalable feedback collection underscore the need for continued innovation. We further discuss emerging directions, including hybrid RL algorithms, verifier-guided training, and multi-objective alignment frameworks. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers advancing RL-driven LLM development, balancing capability enhancement with safety and scalability.</description>

      <title>Mpemba Effect in Large-Language Model Training Dynamics: A Minimal Analysis of the Valley-River model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning rate (LR) schedules in large language model (LLM) training often follow empirical templates: warm-up, constant plateau/stable phase, and decay (WSD). However, the mechanistic explanation for this strategy remains underexplored, and the choice of plateau height and decay schedule is largely heuristic. In this paper, we connect training dynamics to a thermodynamic analogy via the Mpemba effect - a phenomenon in which a hotter system cools faster than a colder one when quenched into the same bath. We analyze a class of "valley-river" loss landscapes, where sharp (valley) directions equilibrate quickly, while flatter (river) directions govern global descent. The Mpemba effect provides an explanation for the necessity of the warm-up phase and motivates a high plateau - rather than a low one - for accelerating loss decrease during decay. We show that for certain loss landscapes, there exists an optimal plateau learning rate - the "strong Mpemba point" - at which the slowest mode vanishes, resulting in faster convergence during the decay phase. We derive analytical conditions for its existence and estimate decay dynamics required to preserve the Mpemba advantage. Our minimal model and analysis offer a principled justification for plateau-based schedulers and provide guidance for tuning LR in LLMs with minimal hyperparameter sweep.</description>

      <title>Clustering via Self-Supervised Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models, widely recognized for their success in generative tasks, have not yet been applied to clustering. We introduce Clustering via Diffusion (CLUDI), a self-supervised framework that combines the generative power of diffusion models with pre-trained Vision Transformer features to achieve robust and accurate clustering. CLUDI is trained via a teacher-student paradigm: the teacher uses stochastic diffusion-based sampling to produce diverse cluster assignments, which the student refines into stable predictions. This stochasticity acts as a novel data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to uncover intricate structures in high-dimensional data. Extensive evaluations on challenging datasets demonstrate that CLUDI achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised classification, setting new benchmarks in clustering robustness and adaptability to complex data distributions.</description>

      <title>Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories and Reasoning about Continuous Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is a new framework of tight integration of answer set programming (ASP) and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). Similar to the relationship between first-order logic and SMT, it is based on a recent proposal of the functional stable model semantics by fixing interpretations of background theories. Analogously to a known relationship between ASP and SAT, ``tight'' ASPMT programs can be translated into SMT instances. We demonstrate the usefulness of ASPMT by enhancing action language C+ to handle continuous changes as well as discrete changes. We reformulate the semantics of C+ in terms ofASPMT, and show that SMT solvers can be used to compute the language. We also show how the language can represent cumulative effects on continuous resources.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in neuromorphic computing demonstrate on-device learning capabilities with low power consumption. One of the key learning units in these systems is the winner-take-all circuit. In this research, we propose a winner-take-all circuit that can be configured to achieve k-winner and hysteresis properties, simulated in IBM 65 nm node. The circuit dissipated 34.9 $\mu$W of power with a latency of 10.4 ns, while processing 1000 inputs. The utility of the circuit is demonstrated for spatial filtering and classification.</description>

      <title>SmartThinker: Learning to Compress and Preserve Reasoning by Step-Level Length Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities through inference-time scaling, but this progress has also introduced considerable redundancy and inefficiency into their reasoning processes, resulting in substantial computational waste. Previous work has attempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated samples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more concise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty often lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while preserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose SmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained control over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each individual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a short-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution, which increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while reducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core components: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward function, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a difficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components enable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps. Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone models demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning while achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods.</description>

      <title>WebSynthesis: World-Model-Guided MCTS for Efficient WebUI-Trajectory Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved the capabilities of web agents. However, effectively navigating complex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced trajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed self-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from real-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where real or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic feedback, complicating the reproduction and debugging of agent behaviors; and (2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can involve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and computational expenses. To address these limitations and enable scalable self-improvement for agents, we propose WebSynthesis, a novel framework for trajectory synthesis and training. WebSynthesis leverages a learned world model to simulate virtual web environments, allowing a policy agent to perform efficient and reversible tree-based planning. This approach supports the large-scale generation of diverse and high-quality trajectories, which are subsequently utilized to refine the agent's policy. Experimental results demonstrate that an agent trained using WebSynthesis on a small-scale synthetic dataset achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing that of models trained on large-scale real-world data.</description>

      <title>MOD-X: A Modular Open Decentralized eXchange Framework proposal for Heterogeneous Interoperable Artificial Intelligence Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04376v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence systems evolve from monolithic models to ecosystems of specialized agents, the need for standardized communication protocols becomes increasingly critical. This paper introduces MOD-X (Modular Open Decentralized eXchange), a novel architectural framework proposal for agent interoperability that addresses key limitations of existing protocols. Unlike current approaches, MOD-X proposes a layered architecture with a Universal Message Bus, thorough state management, translation capabilities, and blockchain-based security mechanisms. We present MOD-X's architecture, compare it with existing protocols, and demonstrate its application through a worked example how it enables integration between heterogeneous specialist agents (agents with different architectures, vendors, capabilities, and knowledge representations--including rule-based systems, neural networks, symbolic reasoning engines, and legacy software with agent wrappers). MOD-X's key innovations include a publish-subscribe communication model, semantic capability discovery, and dynamic workflow orchestration--providing a framework that bridges theoretical formalism with practical implementation. This architecture addresses the growing need for truly decentralized, interoperable agent ecosystems that can scale effectively without the need for central coordination.</description>

      <title>DC-Mamber: A Dual Channel Prediction Model based on Mamba and Linear Transformer for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), existing strategies for processing sequences are typically categorized as channel-independent and channel-mixing. The former treats all temporal information of each variable as a token, focusing on capturing local temporal features of individual variables, while the latter constructs a token from the multivariate information at each time step, emphasizing the modeling of global temporal dependencies. Current mainstream models are mostly based on Transformer and the emerging Mamba. Transformers excel at modeling global dependencies through self-attention mechanisms but exhibit limited sensitivity to local temporal patterns and suffer from quadratic computational complexity, restricting their efficiency in long-sequence processing. In contrast, Mamba, based on state space models (SSMs), achieves linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling but struggles to aggregate global contextual information in parallel. To overcome the limitations of both models, we propose DC-Mamber, a dual-channel forecasting model based on Mamba and linear Transformer for time series forecasting. Specifically, the Mamba-based channel employs a channel-independent strategy to extract intra-variable features, while the Transformer-based channel adopts a channel-mixing strategy to model cross-timestep global dependencies. DC-Mamber first maps the raw input into two distinct feature representations via separate embedding layers. These representations are then processed by a variable encoder (built on Mamba) and a temporal encoder (built on linear Transformer), respectively. Finally, a fusion layer integrates the dual-channel features for prediction. Extensive experiments on eight public datasets confirm DC-Mamber's superior accuracy over existing models.</description>

      <title>LayerCake: Token-Aware Contrastive Decoding within Large Language Model Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language understanding and generation but remain vulnerable to factual errors, limiting their reliability in knowledge-intensive tasks. While decoding-time strategies provide a promising efficient solution without training, existing methods typically treat token-level and layer-level signals in isolation, overlooking the joint dynamics between them. In this work, we introduce a token-aware, layer-localized contrastive decoding method that aligns specific token types with their most influential transformer layers to improve factual generation. Through empirical attention analysis, we identify two key patterns: punctuation tokens receive dominant attention in early layers, while conceptual tokens govern semantic reasoning in intermediate layers. By selectively suppressing attention to these token types at their respective depths, we achieve the induction of controlled factual degradation and derive contrastive signals to guide the final factual decoding. Our method requires no additional training or model modification, and experiments demonstrate that our method consistently improves factuality across multiple LLMs and various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>ARMR: Adaptively Responsive Network for Medication Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task in healthcare, especially for patients with complex medical conditions. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively balance the reuse of historical medications with the introduction of new drugs in response to the changing patient conditions. In order to address this challenge, we propose an Adaptively Responsive network for Medication Recommendation (ARMR), a new method which incorporates 1) a piecewise temporal learning component that distinguishes between recent and distant patient history, enabling more nuanced temporal understanding, and 2) an adaptively responsive mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention to new and existing drugs based on the patient's current health state and medication history. Experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets indicate that ARMR has better performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation metrics, which contributes to more personalized and accurate medication recommendations.

      <description>arXiv:2507.04431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical decision-making is a critical task, where errors can result in serious, potentially life-threatening consequences. While full automation remains challenging, hybrid frameworks that combine machine intelligence with human oversight offer a practical alternative. In this paper, we present MedGellan, a lightweight, annotation-free framework that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate clinical guidance from raw medical records, which is then used by a physician to predict diagnoses. MedGellan uses a Bayesian-inspired prompting strategy that respects the temporal order of clinical data. Preliminary experiments show that the guidance generated by the LLM with MedGellan improves diagnostic performance, particularly in recall and $F_1$ score.</description>

      <title>A Linguistic Analysis of Spontaneous Thoughts: Investigating Experiences of D\'ej\`a Vu, Unexpected Thoughts, and Involuntary Autobiographical Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The onset of spontaneous thoughts are reflective of dynamic interactions between cognition, emotion, and attention. Typically, these experiences are studied through subjective appraisals that focus on their triggers, phenomenology, and emotional salience. In this work, we use linguistic signatures to investigate Deja Vu, Involuntary Autobiographical Memories and Unexpected Thoughts. Specifically, we analyze the inherent characteristics of the linguistic patterns in participant generated descriptions of these thought types. We show how, by positioning language as a window into spontaneous cognition, existing theories on these attentional states can be updated and reaffirmed. Our findings align with prior research, reinforcing that Deja Vu is a metacognitive experience characterized by abstract and spatial language, Involuntary Autobiographical Memories are rich in personal and emotionally significant detail, and Unexpected Thoughts are marked by unpredictability and cognitive disruption. This work is demonstrative of languages potential to reveal deeper insights into how internal spontaneous cognitive states manifest through expression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a critical role in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by identifying unusual behaviors through perception systems that could compromise safety and lead to hazardous situations. Current approaches, which often rely on predefined thresholds or supervised learning paradigms, exhibit reduced efficacy when confronted with unseen scenarios, sensor noise, and occlusions, leading to potential safety-critical failures. Moreover, supervised methods require large annotated datasets, limiting their real-world feasibility. To address these gaps, we propose an anomaly detection framework based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to infer latent driving intentions from sequential perception data, thus enabling robust identification. Specifically, we present Trajectory-Reward Guided Adaptive Pre-training (TRAP), a novel IRL framework for anomaly detection, to address two critical limitations of existing methods: noise robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. Our core innovation is implicitly learning temporal credit assignments via reward and worst-case supervision. We leverage pre-training with variable-horizon sampling to maximize time-to-consequence, resulting in early detection of behavior deviation. Experiments on 14,000+ simulated trajectories demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving 0.90 AUC and 82.2\% F1-score - outperforming similarly trained supervised and unsupervised baselines by 39\% on Recall and 12\% on F1-score, respectively. Similar performance is achieved while exhibiting robustness to various noise types and generalization to unseen anomaly types.

      <title>Thousand-Brains Systems: Sensorimotor Intelligence for Rapid, Robust Learning and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current AI systems achieve impressive performance on many tasks, yet they lack core attributes of biological intelligence, including rapid, continual learning, representations grounded in sensorimotor interactions, and structured knowledge that enables efficient generalization. Neuroscience theory suggests that mammals evolved flexible intelligence through the replication of a semi-independent, sensorimotor module, a functional unit known as a cortical column. To address the disparity between biological and artificial intelligence, thousand-brains systems were proposed as a means of mirroring the architecture of cortical columns and their interactions.
  In the current work, we evaluate the unique properties of Monty, the first implementation of a thousand-brains system. We focus on 3D object perception, and in particular, the combined task of object recognition and pose estimation. Utilizing the YCB dataset of household objects, we first assess Monty's use of sensorimotor learning to build structured representations, finding that these enable robust generalization. These representations include an emphasis on classifying objects by their global shape, as well as a natural ability to detect object symmetries. We then explore Monty's use of model-free and model-based policies to enable rapid inference by supporting principled movements. We find that such policies complement Monty's modular architecture, a design that can accommodate communication between modules to further accelerate inference speed via a novel `voting' algorithm. Finally, we examine Monty's use of associative, Hebbian-like binding to enable rapid, continual, and computationally efficient learning, properties that compare favorably to current deep learning architectures. While Monty is still in a nascent stage of development, these findings support thousand-brains systems as a powerful and promising new approach to AI.</description>

      <title>Churn-Aware Recommendation Planning under Aggregated Preference Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making problem motivated by recent regulatory and technological shifts that limit access to individual user data in recommender systems (RSs), leaving only population-level preference information. This privacy-aware setting poses fundamental challenges in planning under uncertainty: Effective personalization requires exploration to infer user preferences, yet unsatisfactory recommendations risk immediate user churn. To address this, we introduce the Rec-APC model, in which an anonymous user is drawn from a known prior over latent user types (e.g., personas or clusters), and the decision-maker sequentially selects items to recommend. Feedback is binary -- positive responses refine the posterior via Bayesian updates, while negative responses result in the termination of the session.
  We prove that optimal policies converge to pure exploitation in finite time and propose a branch-and-bound algorithm to efficiently compute them. Experiments on synthetic and MovieLens data confirm rapid convergence and demonstrate that our method outperforms the POMDP solver SARSOP, particularly when the number of user types is large or comparable to the number of content categories. Our results highlight the applicability of this approach and inspire new ways to improve decision-making under the constraints imposed by aggregated preference data.</description>

      <title>Towards integration of Privacy Enhancing Technologies in Explainable Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a crucial pathway in mitigating the risk of non-transparency in the decision-making process of black-box Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. However, despite the benefits, XAI methods are found to leak the privacy of individuals whose data is used in training or querying the models. Researchers have demonstrated privacy attacks that exploit explanations to infer sensitive personal information of individuals. Currently there is a lack of defenses against known privacy attacks targeting explanations when vulnerable XAI are used in production and machine learning as a service system. To address this gap, in this article, we explore Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) as a defense mechanism against attribute inference on explanations provided by feature-based XAI methods. We empirically evaluate 3 types of PETs, namely synthetic training data, differentially private training and noise addition, on two categories of feature-based XAI. Our evaluation determines different responses from the mitigation methods and side-effects of PETs on other system properties such as utility and performance. In the best case, PETs integration in explanations reduced the risk of the attack by 49.47%, while maintaining model utility and explanation quality. Through our evaluation, we identify strategies for using PETs in XAI for maximizing benefits and minimizing the success of this privacy attack on sensitive personal information.</description>

      <title>Exploring Core and Periphery Precepts in Biological and Artificial Intelligence: An Outcome-Based Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering methodologies predominantly revolve around established principles of decomposition and recomposition. These principles involve partitioning inputs and outputs at the component level, ensuring that the properties of individual components are preserved upon composition. However, this view does not transfer well to intelligent systems, particularly when addressing the scaling of intelligence as a system property. Our prior research contends that the engineering of general intelligence necessitates a fresh set of overarching systems principles. As a result, we introduced the "core and periphery" principles, a novel conceptual framework rooted in abstract systems theory and the Law of Requisite Variety. In this paper, we assert that these abstract concepts hold practical significance. Through empirical evidence, we illustrate their applicability to both biological and artificial intelligence systems, bridging abstract theory with real-world implementations. Then, we expand on our previous theoretical framework by mathematically defining core-dominant vs periphery-dominant systems.</description>

      <title>DisMS-TS: Eliminating Redundant Multi-Scale Features for Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world time series typically exhibit complex temporal variations, making the time series classification task notably challenging. Recent advancements have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns. However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy improvement up to 9.71%.</description>

      <title>Can Prompt Difficulty be Online Predicted for Accelerating RL Finetuning of Reasoning Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine, enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly reduced LLM rollouts.</description>

      <title>Trojan Horse Prompting: Jailbreaking Conversational Multimodal Models by Forging Assistant Message</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of conversational interfaces has greatly enhanced LLM usability by leveraging dialogue history for sophisticated reasoning. However, this reliance introduces an unexplored attack surface. This paper introduces Trojan Horse Prompting, a novel jailbreak technique. Adversaries bypass safety mechanisms by forging the model's own past utterances within the conversational history provided to its API. A malicious payload is injected into a model-attributed message, followed by a benign user prompt to trigger harmful content generation. This vulnerability stems from Asymmetric Safety Alignment: models are extensively trained to refuse harmful user requests but lack comparable skepticism towards their own purported conversational history. This implicit trust in its "past" creates a high-impact vulnerability. Experimental validation on Google's Gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation shows Trojan Horse Prompting achieves a significantly higher Attack Success Rate (ASR) than established user-turn jailbreaking methods. These findings reveal a fundamental flaw in modern conversational AI security, necessitating a paradigm shift from input-level filtering to robust, protocol-level validation of conversational context integrity.</description>

      <title>LumiCRS: Asymmetric Contrastive Prototype Learning for Long-Tail Conversational Movie Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) often suffer from an extreme long-tail distribution of dialogue data, causing a strong bias toward head-frequency blockbusters that sacrifices diversity and exacerbates the cold-start problem. An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL corpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all mentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention. This imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body representation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose LumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through three mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss (ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head over-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail Recommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to guide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a GPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically generates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity and distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly improve recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and INSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over fifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency, informativeness, and long-tail relevance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-layer collaboration in building an efficient and fair long-tail conversational recommender.</description>

      <title>ChipSeek-R1: Generating Human-Surpassing RTL with LLM via Hierarchical Reward-Driven Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential for automating Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. However, current approaches face a critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional correctness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods based on supervised fine-tuning often generate functionally correct but PPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In contrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after generation are often inefficient because they operate externally without updating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic design capabilities.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven reinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that achieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1 employs a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on syntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from synthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn complex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code that is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on standard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results in functional correctness. Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1 generated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original human-written code. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating toolchain feedback into LLM training and highlight the potential for reinforcement learning to enable automated generation of human-surpassing RTL code. We open-source our code in anonymous github.</description>

      <title>Activation Steering for Chain-of-Thought Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04742v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning when they include intermediate steps, known as "chains of thought" (CoTs). However, these rationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to wasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe that verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct regions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and injecting a "steering vector" to transition between these modes, we can reliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively compressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as Activation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens reasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution, derived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate steering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC achieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets, while maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a training-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on MATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock time on an 8B model. This makes ASC a practical and efficient tool for streamlining the deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs in latency- or cost-sensitive settings.

      <title>LLM-based Question-Answer Framework for Sensor-driven HVAC System Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Question-answering (QA) interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs) present a promising direction for improving interactivity with HVAC system insights, particularly for non-expert users. However, enabling accurate, real-time, and context-aware interactions with HVAC systems introduces unique challenges, including the integration of frequently updated sensor data, domain-specific knowledge grounding, and coherent multi-stage reasoning. In this paper, we present JARVIS, a two-stage LLM-based QA framework tailored for sensor data-driven HVAC system interaction. JARVIS employs an Expert-LLM to translate high-level user queries into structured execution instructions, and an Agent that performs SQL-based data retrieval, statistical processing, and final response generation. To address HVAC-specific challenges, JARVIS integrates (1) an adaptive context injection strategy for efficient HVAC and deployment-specific information integration, (2) a parameterized SQL builder and executor to improve data access reliability, and (3) a bottom-up planning scheme to ensure consistency across multi-stage response generation. We evaluate JARVIS using real-world data collected from a commercial HVAC system and a ground truth QA dataset curated by HVAC experts to demonstrate its effectiveness in delivering accurate and interpretable responses across diverse queries. Results show that JARVIS consistently outperforms baseline and ablation variants in both automated and user-centered assessments, achieving high response quality and accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Furniture decoration is an important task in various industrial applications. However, achieving a high-quality decorative result is often time-consuming and requires specialized artistic expertise. To tackle these challenges, we explore how multi-agent systems can assist in automating the decoration process. We propose FurniMAS, a multi-agent system for automatic furniture decoration. Specifically, given a human prompt and a household furniture item such as a working desk or a TV stand, our system suggests relevant assets with appropriate styles and materials, and arranges them on the item, ensuring the decorative result meets functionality, aesthetic, and ambiance preferences. FurniMAS assembles a hybrid team of LLM-based and non-LLM agents, each fulfilling distinct roles in a typical decoration project. These agents collaborate through communication, logical reasoning, and validation to transform the requirements into the final outcome. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FurniMAS significantly outperforms other baselines in generating high-quality 3D decor.</description>

The use of LLMs for this task has several advantages over existing machine learning-based solutions such as not requiring a large training dataset and the ability to utilize free-text incident logs. We propose a fully LLM-based solution that predicts the incident impact using a combination of traffic features and LLM-extracted incident features. A key ingredient of this solution is an effective method of selecting examples for the LLM's in-context learning. We evaluate the performance of three advanced LLMs and two state-of-the-art machine learning models on a real traffic incident dataset. The results show that the best-performing LLM matches the accuracy of the most accurate machine learning model, despite the former not having been trained on this prediction task. The findings indicate that LLMs are a practically viable option for traffic incident impact prediction.</description>

      <title>DoPI: Doctor-like Proactive Interrogation LLM for Traditional Chinese Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing interrogation capabilities in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnosis through multi-turn dialogues and knowledge graphs presents a significant challenge for modern AI systems. Current large language models (LLMs), despite their advancements, exhibit notable limitations in medical applications, particularly in conducting effective multi-turn dialogues and proactive questioning. These shortcomings hinder their practical application and effectiveness in simulating real-world diagnostic scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose DoPI, a novel LLM system specifically designed for the TCM domain. The DoPI system introduces a collaborative architecture comprising a guidance model and an expert model. The guidance model conducts multi-turn dialogues with patients and dynamically generates questions based on a knowledge graph to efficiently extract critical symptom information. Simultaneously, the expert model leverages deep TCM expertise to provide final diagnoses and treatment plans. Furthermore, this study constructs a multi-turn doctor-patient dialogue dataset to simulate realistic consultation scenarios and proposes a novel evaluation methodology that does not rely on manually collected real-world consultation data. Experimental results show that the DoPI system achieves an accuracy rate of 84.68 percent in interrogation outcomes, significantly enhancing the model's communication ability during diagnosis while maintaining professional expertise.</description>

      <title>MARBLE: A Multi-Agent Rule-Based LLM Reasoning Engine for Accident Severity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accident severity prediction plays a critical role in transportation safety systems but is a persistently difficult task due to incomplete data, strong feature dependencies, and severe class imbalance in which rare but high-severity cases are underrepresented and hard to detect. Existing methods often rely on monolithic models or black box prompting, which struggle to scale in noisy, real-world settings and offer limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose MARBLE a multiagent rule based LLM engine that decomposes the severity prediction task across a team of specialized reasoning agents, including an interchangeable ML-backed agent. Each agent focuses on a semantic subset of features (e.g., spatial, environmental, temporal), enabling scoped reasoning and modular prompting without the risk of prompt saturation. Predictions are coordinated through either rule-based or LLM-guided consensus mechanisms that account for class rarity and confidence dynamics. The system retains structured traces of agent-level reasoning and coordination outcomes, supporting in-depth interpretability and post-hoc performance diagnostics. Across both UK and US datasets, MARBLE consistently outperforms traditional machine learning classifiers and state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompt-based reasoning methods including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (L2M), and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) achieving nearly 90% accuracy where others plateau below 48%. This performance redefines the practical ceiling for accident severity classification under real world noise and extreme class imbalance. Our results position MARBLE as a generalizable and interpretable framework for reasoning under uncertainty in safety-critical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Supported Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning (sAA-CBR), a binary classification model in which past cases engage in debates by arguing in favour of their labelling and attacking or supporting those with opposing or agreeing labels. With supports, sAA-CBR overcomes the limitation of its precursor AA-CBR, which can contain extraneous cases (or spikes) that are not included in the debates. We prove that sAA-CBR contains no spikes, without trading off key model properties</description>

      <title>When Imitation Learning Outperforms Reinforcement Learning in Surgical Action Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surgical action planning requires predicting future instrument-verb-target triplets for real-time assistance. While teleoperated robotic surgery provides natural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement learning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through exploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for surgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation Learning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and 33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at 10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL, direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches underperformed DARIL i.e. world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.</description>

      <title>How Rules Represent Causal Knowledge: Causal Modeling with Abductive Logic Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pearl observes that causal knowledge enables predicting the effects of interventions, such as actions, whereas descriptive knowledge only permits drawing conclusions from observation. This paper extends Pearl's approach to causality and interventions to the setting of stratified abductive logic programs. It shows how stable models of such programs can be given a causal interpretation by building on philosophical foundations and recent work by Bochman and Eelink et al. In particular, it provides a translation of abductive logic programs into causal systems, thereby clarifying the informal causal reading of logic program rules and supporting principled reasoning about external actions. The main result establishes that the stable model semantics for stratified programs conforms to key philosophical principles of causation, such as causal sufficiency, natural necessity, and irrelevance of unobserved effects. This justifies the use of stratified abductive logic programs as a framework for causal modeling and for predicting the effects of interventions</description>

      <title>Rule Learning for Knowledge Graph Reasoning under Agnostic Distribution Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05110v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) reasoning remains a critical research area focused on inferring missing knowledge by analyzing relationships among observed facts. Despite its success, a key limitation of existing KG reasoning methods is their dependence on the I.I.D assumption. This assumption can easily be violated due to unknown sample selection bias during training or agnostic distribution shifts during testing, significantly compromising model performance and reliability. To facilitate the deployment of KG reasoning in wild environments, this study investigates learning logical rules from KGs affected by unknown selection bias. Additionally, we address test sets with agnostic distribution shifts, formally defining this challenge as out-of-distribution (OOD) KG reasoning-a previously underexplored problem. To solve the issue, we propose the Stable Rule Learning (StableRule) framework, an end-to-end methodology that integrates feature decorrelation with rule learning network, to enhance OOD generalization performance. By leveraging feature decorrelation, the StableRule framework mitigates the adverse effects of covariate shifts arising in OOD scenarios, thereby improving the robustness of the rule learning component in effectively deriving logical rules. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark KGs demonstrate the framework's superior effectiveness and stability across diverse heterogeneous environments, underscoring its practical significance for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>GIST: Cross-Domain Click-Through Rate Prediction via Guided Content-Behavior Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain Click-Through Rate prediction aims to tackle the data sparsity and the cold start problems in online advertising systems by transferring knowledge from source domains to a target domain. Most existing methods rely on overlapping users to facilitate this transfer, often focusing on joint training or pre-training with fine-tuning approach to connect the source and target domains. However, in real-world industrial settings, joint training struggles to learn optimal representations with different distributions, and pre-training with fine-tuning is not well-suited for continuously integrating new data. To address these issues, we propose GIST, a cross-domain lifelong sequence model that decouples the training processes of the source and target domains. Unlike previous methods that search lifelong sequences in the source domains using only content or behavior signals or their simple combinations, we innovatively introduce a Content-Behavior Joint Training Module (CBJT), which aligns content-behavior distributions and combines them with guided information to facilitate a more stable representation. Furthermore, we develop an Asymmetric Similarity Integration strategy (ASI) to augment knowledge transfer through similarity computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GIST, surpassing SOTA methods on offline evaluations and an online A/B test. Deployed on the Xiaohongshu (RedNote) platform, GIST effectively enhances online ads system performance at scale, serving hundreds of millions of daily active users.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05201v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential in healthcare applications, but its training and deployment faces challenges due to healthcare's diverse data, complex tasks, and the need to preserve privacy. Foundation models that perform well on medical tasks and require less task-specific tuning data are critical to accelerate the development of healthcare AI applications. We introduce MedGemma, a collection of medical vision-language foundation models based on Gemma 3 4B and 27B. MedGemma demonstrates advanced medical understanding and reasoning on images and text, significantly exceeding the performance of similar-sized generative models and approaching the performance of task-specific models, while maintaining the general capabilities of the Gemma 3 base models. For out-of-distribution tasks, MedGemma achieves 2.6-10% improvement on medical multimodal question answering, 15.5-18.1% improvement on chest X-ray finding classification, and 10.8% improvement on agentic evaluations compared to the base models. Fine-tuning MedGemma further improves performance in subdomains, reducing errors in electronic health record information retrieval by 50% and reaching comparable performance to existing specialized state-of-the-art methods for pneumothorax classification and histopathology patch classification. We additionally introduce MedSigLIP, a medically-tuned vision encoder derived from SigLIP. MedSigLIP powers the visual understanding capabilities of MedGemma and as an encoder achieves comparable or better performance than specialized medical image encoders. Taken together, the MedGemma collection provides a strong foundation of medical image and text capabilities, with potential to significantly accelerate medical research and development of downstream applications. The MedGemma collection, including tutorials and model weights, can be found at https://goo.gle/medgemma.</description>

      <title>SciMaster: Towards General-Purpose Scientific AI Agents, Part I. X-Master as Foundation: Can We Lead on Humanity's Last Exam?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05241v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancements of AI agents have ignited the long-held ambition of leveraging them to accelerate scientific discovery. Achieving this goal requires a deep understanding of the frontiers of human knowledge. As such, Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) provides an exceptionally challenging touchstone for evaluating scientific AI agents. In this work, we aim to construct the foundational architecture for general-purpose agents and validate the capabilities through leading performance on HLE. To achieve this, we introduce X-Master, a tool-augmented reasoning agent designed to emulate human researchers by interacting flexibly with external tools during its reasoning process. This agent, guided by the conceptualization of code as an interaction language, can flexibly leverage built-in Python libraries and our customized tools to augment the reasoning. We further scale its capabilities through X-Masters, a scattered-and-stacked agentic workflow that systematically enhances breadth and depth of reasoning. Our open-source solution, X-Masters, sets a new state-of-the-art record on HLE with a score of 32.1%, surpassing OpenAI's and Google's Deep Research (26.6% and 26.9%) and becoming the first to exceed the 30% threshold. This work allows us to gain a deeper understanding of complex task-solving and accumulates valuable experience that can inform future advancements, guiding subsequent model training.</description>

      <title>Modeling Latent Partner Strategies for Adaptive Zero-Shot Human-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In collaborative tasks, being able to adapt to your teammates is a necessary requirement for success. When teammates are heterogeneous, such as in human-agent teams, agents need to be able to observe, recognize, and adapt to their human partners in real time. This becomes particularly challenging in tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces where the dynamics can change rapidly. In this work, we introduce TALENTS, a strategy-conditioned cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a range of partner strategies, enabling ad-hoc teamwork. Our approach utilizes a variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from trajectory data. This latent space represents the underlying strategies that agents employ. Subsequently, the system identifies different types of strategy by clustering the data. Finally, a cooperator agent is trained to generate partners for each type of strategy, conditioned on these clusters. In order to adapt to previously unseen partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization algorithm that infers and adjusts the estimated partner strategy dynamically. We assess our approach in a customized version of the Overcooked environment, posing a challenging cooperative cooking task that demands strong coordination across a wide range of possible strategies. Using an online user study, we show that our agent outperforms current baselines when working with unfamiliar human partners.</description>

      <title>When Chain of Thought is Necessary, Language Models Struggle to Evade Monitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is an appealing AI safety defense, recent work on "unfaithfulness" has cast doubt on its reliability. These findings highlight an important failure mode, particularly when CoT acts as a post-hoc rationalization in applications like auditing for bias. However, for the distinct problem of runtime monitoring to prevent severe harm, we argue the key property is not faithfulness but monitorability. To this end, we introduce a conceptual framework distinguishing CoT-as-rationalization from CoT-as-computation. We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require complex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating the experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad behavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose its reasoning, making it monitorable. We then present methodology guidelines to stress-test CoT monitoring against deliberate evasion. Applying these guidelines, we find that models can learn to obscure their intentions, but only when given significant help, such as detailed human-written strategies or iterative optimization against the monitor. We conclude that, while not infallible, CoT monitoring offers a substantial layer of defense that requires active protection and continued stress-testing.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Aesthetic Appeal of AI-Generated Physical Product Designs through LoRA Fine-Tuning with Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores how Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, guided by human aesthetic evaluations, can enhance the outputs of generative AI models in tangible product design, using lamp design as a case study. By integrating human feedback into the AI model, we aim to improve both the desirability and aesthetic appeal of the generated designs. Comprehensive experiments were conducted, starting with prompt optimization techniques and focusing on LoRA fine-tuning of the Stable Diffusion model. Additionally, methods to convert AI-generated designs into tangible products through 3D realization using 3D printing technologies were investigated. The results indicate that LoRA fine-tuning effectively aligns AI-generated designs with human aesthetic preferences, leading to significant improvements in desirability and aesthetic appeal scores. These findings highlight the potential of human-AI collaboration in tangible product design and provide valuable insights into integrating human feedback into AI design processes.</description>

      <title>ZettaLith: An Architectural Exploration of Extreme-Scale AI Inference Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high computational cost and power consumption of current and anticipated AI systems present a major challenge for widespread deployment and further scaling. Current hardware approaches face fundamental efficiency limits. This paper introduces ZettaLith, a scalable computing architecture designed to reduce the cost and power of AI inference by over 1,000x compared to current GPU-based systems. Based on architectural analysis and technology projections, a single ZettaLith rack could potentially achieve 1.507 zettaFLOPS in 2027 - representing a theoretical 1,047x improvement in inference performance, 1,490x better power efficiency, and could be 2,325x more cost-effective than current leading GPU racks for FP4 transformer inference. The ZettaLith architecture achieves these gains by abandoning general purpose GPU applications, and via the multiplicative effect of numerous co-designed architectural innovations using established digital electronic technologies, as detailed in this paper. ZettaLith's core architectural principles scale down efficiently to exaFLOPS desktop systems and petaFLOPS mobile chips, maintaining their roughly 1,000x advantage. ZettaLith presents a simpler system architecture compared to the complex hierarchy of current GPU clusters. ZettaLith is optimized exclusively for AI inference and is not applicable for AI training.</description>

      <title>Lightweight LSTM Model for Energy Theft Detection via Input Data Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing integration of smart meters in electrical grids worldwide, detecting energy theft has become a critical and ongoing challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have demonstrated strong performance in identifying fraudulent consumption patterns; however, previous works exploring the use of machine learning solutions for this problem demand high computational and energy costs, limiting their practicality -- particularly in low-theft scenarios where continuous inference can result in unnecessary energy usage. This paper proposes a lightweight detection unit, or watchdog mechanism, designed to act as a pre-filter that determines when to activate a long short-term memory (LSTM) model. This mechanism reduces the volume of input fed to the LSTM model, limiting it to instances that are more likely to involve energy theft thereby preserving detection accuracy while substantially reducing energy consumption associated with continuous model execution. The proposed system was evaluated through simulations across six scenarios with varying theft severity and number of active thieves. Results indicate a power consumption reduction exceeding 64\%, with minimal loss in detection accuracy and consistently high recall. These findings support the feasibility of a more energy-efficient and scalable approach to energy theft detection in smart grids. In contrast to prior work that increases model complexity to achieve marginal accuracy gains, this study emphasizes practical deployment considerations such as inference efficiency and system scalability. The results highlight the potential for deploying sustainable, AI-assisted monitoring systems within modern smart grid infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Using Large Language Models to Study Mathematical Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The philosophy of mathematical practice (PMP) looks to evidence from working mathematics to help settle philosophical questions. One prominent program under the PMP banner is the study of explanation in mathematics, which aims to understand what sorts of proofs mathematicians consider explanatory and what role the pursuit of explanation plays in mathematical practice. In an effort to address worries about cherry-picked examples and file-drawer problems in PMP, a handful of authors have recently turned to corpus analysis methods as a promising alternative to small-scale case studies. This paper reports the results from such a corpus study facilitated by Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, a model whose reasoning capabilities, advances in hallucination control and large context window allow for the accurate analysis of hundreds of pages of text per query. Based on a sample of 5000 mathematics papers from arXiv.org, the experiments yielded a dataset of hundreds of useful annotated examples. Its aim was to gain insight on questions like the following: How often do mathematicians make claims about explanation in the relevant sense? Do mathematicians' explanatory practices vary in any noticeable way by subject matter? Which philosophical theories of explanation are most consistent with a large body of non-cherry-picked examples? How might philosophers make further use of AI tools to gain insights from large datasets of this kind? As the first PMP study making extensive use of LLM methods, it also seeks to begin a conversation about these methods as research tools in practice-oriented philosophy and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of current models for such work.</description>

      <title>AuraGenome: An LLM-Powered Framework for On-the-Fly Reusable and Scalable Circular Genome Visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circular genome visualizations are essential for exploring structural variants and gene regulation. However, existing tools often require complex scripting and manual configuration, making the process time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to learn. To address these challenges, we introduce AuraGenome, an LLM-powered framework for rapid, reusable, and scalable generation of multi-layered circular genome visualizations. AuraGenome combines a semantic-driven multi-agent workflow with an interactive visual analytics system. The workflow employs seven specialized LLM-driven agents, each assigned distinct roles such as intent recognition, layout planning, and code generation, to transform raw genomic data into tailored visualizations. The system supports multiple coordinated views tailored for genomic data, offering ring, radial, and chord-based layouts to represent multi-layered circular genome visualizations. In addition to enabling interactions and configuration reuse, the system supports real-time refinement and high-quality report export. We validate its effectiveness through two case studies and a comprehensive user study. AuraGenome is available at: https://github.com/Darius18/AuraGenome.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-Driven Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm for Expensive Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) are a key tool for addressing costly optimization tasks, with their efficiency being heavily dependent on the selection of surrogate models and infill sampling criteria. However, designing an effective dynamic selection strategy for SAEAs is labor-intensive and requires substantial domain knowledge. To address this challenge, this paper proposes LLM-SAEA, a novel approach that integrates large language models (LLMs) to configure both surrogate models and infill sampling criteria online. Specifically, LLM-SAEA develops a collaboration-of-experts framework, where one LLM serves as a scoring expert (LLM-SE), assigning scores to surrogate models and infill sampling criteria based on their optimization performance, while another LLM acts as a decision expert (LLM-DE), selecting the appropriate configurations by analyzing their scores along with the current optimization state. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-SAEA outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms across standard test cases.

      <title>Particle Swarm Optimization for Quantum Circuit Synthesis: Performance Analysis and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses how particle swarm optimization (PSO) can be used to generate quantum circuits to solve an instance of the MaxOne problem. It then analyzes previous studies on evolutionary algorithms for circuit synthesis. With a brief introduction to PSO, including its parameters and algorithm flow, the paper focuses on a method of quantum circuit encoding and representation as PSO parameters. The fitness evaluation used in this paper is the MaxOne problem. The paper presents experimental results that compare different learning abilities and inertia weight variations in the PSO algorithm. A comparison is further made between the PSO algorithm and a genetic algorithm for quantum circuit synthesis. The results suggest PSO converges more quickly to the optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Sports Strategy with Video Analytics and Data Mining: Assessing the effectiveness of Multimodal LLMs in tennis video analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years has also given rise to the development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). These new MLLMs allow us to process images, videos and even audio alongside textual inputs. In this project, we aim to assess the effectiveness of MLLMs in analysing sports videos, focusing mainly on tennis videos. Despite research done on tennis analysis, there remains a gap in models that are able to understand and identify the sequence of events in a tennis rally, which would be useful in other fields of sports analytics. As such, we will mainly assess the MLLMs on their ability to fill this gap - to classify tennis actions, as well as their ability to identify these actions in a sequence of tennis actions in a rally. We further looked into ways we can improve the MLLMs' performance, including different training methods and even using them together with other traditional models.</description>

      <title>Preference-Optimal Multi-Metric Weighting for Parallel Coordinate Plots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel coordinate plots (PCPs) are a prevalent method to interpret the relationship between the control parameters and metrics. PCPs deliver such an interpretation by color gradation based on a single metric. However, it is challenging to provide such a gradation when multiple metrics are present. Although a naive approach involves calculating a single metric by linearly weighting each metric, such weighting is unclear for users. To address this problem, we first propose a principled formulation for calculating the optimal weight based on a specific preferred metric combination. Although users can simply select their preference from a two-dimensional (2D) plane for bi-metric problems, multi-metric problems require intuitive visualization to allow them to select their preference. We achieved this using various radar charts to visualize the metric trade-offs on the 2D plane reduced by UMAP. In the analysis using pedestrian flow guidance planning, our method identified unique patterns of control parameter importance for each user preference, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Kernel Graph Neural Networks for Neurocognitive Decline Analysis from Multimodal Brain Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal neuroimages, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), offer complementary perspectives on brain activities by capturing structural or functional interactions among brain regions. While existing studies suggest that fusing these multimodal data helps detect abnormal brain activity caused by neurocognitive decline, they are generally implemented in Euclidean space and can't effectively capture intrinsic hierarchical organization of structural/functional brain networks. This paper presents a hyperbolic kernel graph fusion (HKGF) framework for neurocognitive decline analysis with multimodal neuroimages. It consists of a multimodal graph construction module, a graph representation learning module that encodes brain graphs in hyperbolic space through a family of hyperbolic kernel graph neural networks (HKGNNs), a cross-modality coupling module that enables effective multimodal data fusion, and a hyperbolic neural network for downstream predictions. Notably, HKGNNs represent graphs in hyperbolic space to capture both local and global dependencies among brain regions while preserving the hierarchical structure of brain networks. Extensive experiments involving over 4,000 subjects with DTI and/or fMRI data suggest the superiority of HKGF over state-of-the-art methods in two neurocognitive decline prediction tasks. HKGF is a general framework for multimodal data analysis, facilitating objective quantification of structural/functional brain connectivity changes associated with neurocognitive decline.</description>

      <title>Causal-Paced Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing effective task sequences is crucial for curriculum reinforcement learning (CRL), where agents must gradually acquire skills by training on intermediate tasks. A key challenge in CRL is to identify tasks that promote exploration, yet are similar enough to support effective transfer. While recent approach suggests comparing tasks via their Structural Causal Models (SCMs), the method requires access to ground-truth causal structures, an unrealistic assumption in most RL settings. In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep Reinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM differences between tasks based on interaction data approximation. This signal captures task novelty, which we combine with the agent's learnability, measured by reward gain, to form a unified objective. Empirically, CP-DRL outperforms existing curriculum methods on the Point Mass benchmark, achieving faster convergence and higher returns. CP-DRL demonstrates reduced variance with comparable final returns in the Bipedal Walker-Trivial setting, and achieves the highest average performance in the Infeasible variant. These results indicate that leveraging causal relationships between tasks can improve the structure-awareness and sample efficiency of curriculum reinforcement learning. We provide the full implementation of CP-DRL to facilitate the reproduction of our main results at https://github.com/Cho-Geonwoo/CP-DRL.</description>

      <title>DiceHuBERT: Distilling HuBERT with a Self-Supervised Learning Objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DiceHuBERT, a knowledge distillation framework for compressing HuBERT, a widely used self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech foundation model. Unlike existing distillation methods that rely on layer-wise and feature-wise mapping between teacher and student models, DiceHuBERT leverages HuBERT's iterative self-distillation mechanism by directly replacing the original model with a student model. This replacement allows the student to be trained using the same SSL objective used when pre-training HuBERT, eliminating the need for additional modules or architectural constraints. Experimental results on SUPERB show that DiceHuBERT consistently outperforms existing distillation methods, improving phoneme recognition performance by over 21% and ASR performance by more than 14%. Furthermore, DiceHuBERT demonstrates competitive performance across multiple tasks, highlighting its clear advantage.</description>

      <title>Multicollinearity Resolution Based on Machine Learning: A Case Study of Carbon Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes an analytical framework that integrates DBSCAN clustering with the Elastic Net regression model to address multifactorial problems characterized by structural complexity and multicollinearity, exemplified by carbon emissions analysis. DBSCAN is employed for unsupervised learning to objectively cluster features, while the Elastic Net is utilized for high-dimensional feature selection and complexity control. The Elastic Net is specifically chosen for its ability to balance feature selection and regularization by combining L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge) penalties, making it particularly suited for datasets with correlated predictors. Applying this framework to energy consumption data from 46 industries in China (2000-2019) resulted in the identification of 16 categories. Emission characteristics and drivers were quantitatively assessed for each category, demonstrating the framework's capacity to identify primary emission sources and provide actionable insights. This research underscores the global applicability of the framework for analyzing complex regional challenges, such as carbon emissions, and highlights qualitative features that humans find meaningful may not be accurate for the model.</description>

Abstract: Many e-learning platforms assert their ability or potential to improve students' self-regulated learning (SRL), however the cyclical and undirected nature of SRL theoretical models represent significant challenges for representation within contemporary machine learning frameworks. We apply SRL-informed features to trace data in order to advance modelling of students' SRL activities, to improve predictability and explainability regarding the causal effects of learning in an eLearning environment. We demonstrate that these features improve predictive accuracy and validate the value of further research into cyclic modelling techniques for SRL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) paradigm, a recent self-supervised learning framework that predicts latent representations of masked regions in high-level feature spaces, we propose Audio-JEPA (Audio Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), tailored specifically for audio data. Audio-JEPA uses a simple Vision Transformer backbone to predict latent representations of masked spectrogram patches rather than reconstructing raw audio. We pre-train on unlabeled AudioSet clips (10s, 32kHz) with random patch masking on mel-spectrograms. We evaluate on the X-ARES suite covering speech, music, and environmental sound tasks. Although our implementation is a straightforward translation of the original model to audio, the results still show comparable performance to wav2vec 2.0 and data2vec while using less than one-fifth of their training data and with no hyper-parameter tuning. All code and pretrained checkpoints will be released on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Efficient Certified Reasoning for Binarized Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as essential components in safety-critical applications -- these use cases demand complex, yet trustworthy computations. Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are a type of neural network where each neuron is constrained to a Boolean value; they are particularly well-suited for safety-critical tasks because they retain much of the computational capacities of full-scale (floating-point or quantized) deep neural networks, but remain compatible with satisfiability solvers for qualitative verification and with model counters for quantitative reasoning. However, existing methods for BNN analysis suffer from either limited scalability or susceptibility to soundness errors, which hinders their applicability in real-world scenarios.
  In this work, we present a scalable and trustworthy approach for both qualitative and quantitative verification of BNNs. Our approach introduces a native representation of BNN constraints in a custom-designed solver for qualitative reasoning, and in an approximate model counter for quantitative reasoning. We further develop specialized proof generation and checking pipelines with native support for BNN constraint reasoning, ensuring trustworthiness for all of our verification results. Empirical evaluations on a BNN robustness verification benchmark suite demonstrate that our certified solving approach achieves a $9\times$ speedup over prior certified CNF and PB-based approaches, and our certified counting approach achieves a $218\times$ speedup over the existing CNF-based baseline. In terms of coverage, our pipeline produces fully certified results for $99\%$ and $86\%$ of the qualitative and quantitative reasoning queries on BNNs, respectively. This is in sharp contrast to the best existing baselines which can fully certify only $62\%$ and $4\%$ of the queries, respectively.</description>

      <title>Echo State Transformer: When chaos brings memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models and their underlying Transformer architecture are remarkably efficient, they do not reflect how our brain processes and learns a diversity of cognitive tasks such as language and working memory. Furthermore, sequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier: quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these limitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less reliant on intensive computations and massive volumes of data. We introduce Echo State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves this challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in low-data regimes. EST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from Reservoir Computing to create a fixedsize window distributed memory system. Drawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of the Reservoir Computing paradigm, our architecture integrates a new module called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs (i.e. random recurrent networks) working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent memory units with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical reservoir hyperparameters controlling the dynamics are now trained. Thus, the EST dynamically adapts the memory/non-linearity trade-off in reservoirs. By maintaining a fixed number of memory units regardless of sequence length, EST achieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively breaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. Evaluations on the STREAM benchmark, which comprises 12 diverse sequential processing tasks, demonstrate that EST outperforms GRUs, LSTMs, and even Transformers on 8 of these tasks. These findings highlight that Echo State Transformers can be an effective replacement to GRUs and LSTMs while complementing standard Transformers at least on resource-constrained environments and low-data scenarios across diverse sequential processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Visual-Conversational Interface for Evidence-Based Explanation of Diabetes Risk Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Healthcare professionals need effective ways to use, understand, and validate AI-driven clinical decision support systems. Existing systems face two key limitations: complex visualizations and a lack of grounding in scientific evidence. We present an integrated decision support system that combines interactive visualizations with a conversational agent to explain diabetes risk assessments. We propose a hybrid prompt handling approach combining fine-tuned language models for analytical queries with general Large Language Models (LLMs) for broader medical questions, a methodology for grounding AI explanations in scientific evidence, and a feature range analysis technique to support deeper understanding of feature contributions. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 healthcare professionals and found that the conversational interactions helped healthcare professionals build a clear understanding of model assessments, while the integration of scientific evidence calibrated trust in the system's decisions. Most participants reported that the system supported both patient risk evaluation and recommendation.</description>

      <title>PlaceFM: A Training-free Geospatial Foundation Model of Places</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial structure is central to effective geospatial intelligence systems. While foundation models have shown promise, they often lack the flexibility to reason about places, which are context-rich regions spanning different spatial granularities. We propose PlaceFM, a spatial foundation model that captures place representations using a training-free graph condensation method. PlaceFM condenses a nationwide POI graph built from integrated Foursquare and OpenStreetMap data in the U.S., generating general-purpose embeddings of places. These embeddings can be seamlessly integrated into geolocation data pipelines to support a wide range of downstream tasks. Without requiring pretraining, PlaceFM offers a scalable and adaptable solution for multi-scale geospatial analysis.</description>

      <title>A Unified Speech LLM for Diarization and Speech Recognition in Multilingual Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) have emerged as a crucial paradigm in recent years, extending the capabilities of traditional LLMs to speech tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken dialogue modeling. However, their effectiveness in real-world multilingual conversations remains limited by the scarcity of data that captures natural conversational phenomena. To address this, the MLC-SLM Challenge provides a multilingual conversational dataset and evaluates models on two tasks: ASR with oracle segmentation (Task I) and joint diarization and recognition without oracle information (Task II). In this paper, we focus on Task II and propose a unified speech LLM that jointly performs diarization and ASR in an end-to-end manner. By reformulating the training data format and modifying the inference procedure, our model addresses the ambiguity inherent in pre-segmented audio and achieves a 54.87\% relative improvement in tcpWER/tcpCER over the baseline, ranking 8th overall, despite using a smaller LLM backbone. We also report results from Task I using a fine-tuned speech LLM.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hidden Confounding by Progressive Confounder Imputation via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hidden confounding remains a central challenge in estimating treatment effects from observational data, as unobserved variables can lead to biased causal estimates. While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for causal inference, most approaches still rely on the unconfoundedness assumption. In this paper, we make the first attempt to mitigate hidden confounding using LLMs. We propose ProCI (Progressive Confounder Imputation), a framework that elicits the semantic and world knowledge of LLMs to iteratively generate, impute, and validate hidden confounders. ProCI leverages two key capabilities of LLMs: their strong semantic reasoning ability, which enables the discovery of plausible confounders from both structured and unstructured inputs, and their embedded world knowledge, which supports counterfactual reasoning under latent confounding. To improve robustness, ProCI adopts a distributional reasoning strategy instead of direct value imputation to prevent the collapsed outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProCI uncovers meaningful confounders and significantly improves treatment effect estimation across various datasets and LLMs.</description>

      <title>OBSER: Object-Based Sub-Environment Recognition for Zero-Shot Environmental Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Object-Based Sub-Environment Recognition (OBSER) framework, a novel Bayesian framework that infers three fundamental relationships between sub-environments and their constituent objects. In the OBSER framework, metric and self-supervised learning models estimate the object distributions of sub-environments on the latent space to compute these measures. Both theoretically and empirically, we validate the proposed framework by introducing the ($\epsilon,\delta$) statistically separable (EDS) function which indicates the alignment of the representation. Our framework reliably performs inference in open-world and photorealistic environments and outperforms scene-based methods in chained retrieval tasks. The OBSER framework enables zero-shot recognition of environments to achieve autonomous environment understanding.</description>

      <title>MolProphecy: Bridging Medicinal Chemists' Knowledge and Molecular Pre-Trained Models via a Multi-Modal Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MolProphecy is a human-in-the-loop (HITL) multi-modal framework designed to integrate chemists' domain knowledge into molecular property prediction models. While molecular pre-trained models have enabled significant gains in predictive accuracy, they often fail to capture the tacit, interpretive reasoning central to expert-driven molecular design. To address this, MolProphecy employs ChatGPT as a virtual chemist to simulate expert-level reasoning and decision-making. The generated chemist knowledge is embedded by the large language model (LLM) as a dedicated knowledge representation and then fused with graph-based molecular features through a gated cross-attention mechanism, enabling joint reasoning over human-derived and structural features. Evaluated on four benchmark datasets (FreeSolv, BACE, SIDER, and ClinTox), MolProphecy outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, achieving a 15.0 percent reduction in RMSE on FreeSolv and a 5.39 percent improvement in AUROC on BACE. Analysis reveals that chemist knowledge and structural features provide complementary contributions, improving both accuracy and interpretability. MolProphecy offers a practical and generalizable approach for collaborative drug discovery, with the flexibility to incorporate real chemist input in place of the current simulated proxy--without the need for model retraining. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangruochi/MolProphecy.</description>

      <title>Experiment on creating a neural network with weights determined by the potential of a simulated electrostatic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the possibility of determining the weights and thresholds of a neural network using the potential -- a parameter of an electrostatic field -- without analytical calculations and without applying training algorithms. The work is based on neural network architectures employing metric recognition methods. The electrostatic field is simulated in the Builder C++ environment. In the same environment, a neural network based on metric recognition methods is constructed, with the weights of the first-layer neurons determined by the values of the potentials of the simulated electrostatic field. The effectiveness of the resulting neural network within the simulated system is evaluated using the MNIST test dataset under various initial conditions of the simulated system. The results demonstrated functional viability. The implementation of this approach shows that a neural network can obtain weight values almost instantaneously from the electrostatic field, without the need for analytical computations, lengthy training procedures, or massive training datasets.</description>

      <title>Theory of Mind in Action: The Instruction Inference Task</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to an agent's capacity to infer the mental states of other agents. ToM is essential for effective collaboration. To assess ToM in a dynamic, goal-oriented, and collaborative environment, we introduce a novel task, Instruction Inference, in which an agent assists a principal in reaching a goal by interpreting indirect or ambiguous instructions. We present Tomcat, an LLM-based agent, designed to exhibit ToM reasoning in interpreting and responding to the principal's instructions. We implement two variants of Tomcat. One, dubbed Fs-CoT, is based on a small number of examples (i.e., few-shot or Fs) demonstrating the requisite structured reasoning (i.e., chain-of-thought or CoT). One, dubbed CP, relies on commonsense knowledge and information about the problem (i.e., commonsense prompt or CP). We realized both variants of Tomcat on three leading large language models (LLMs), namely, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemma-3-27B. To evaluate the effectiveness of Tomcat, we conducted a study with 52 human participants in which we provided participants with the same information as the CP variant of Tomcat. We computed intent accuracy, action optimality, and planning optimality to measure the ToM capabilities of Tomcat and our study participants. We found that Tomcat with Fs-CoT, particularly with GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1, achieves performance comparable to the human participants, underscoring its ToM potential for human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>FoGE: Fock Space inspired encoding for graph prompting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results show that modern Large Language Models (LLM) are indeed capable of understanding and answering questions about structured data such as graphs. This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based structures effortlessly.</description>

      <title>A Large Language Model-Empowered Agent for Reliable and Robust Structural Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across diverse open-domain tasks, yet their application in specialized domains such as civil engineering remains largely unexplored. This paper starts bridging this gap by evaluating and enhancing the reliability and robustness of LLMs in structural analysis of beams. Reliability is assessed through the accuracy of correct outputs under repetitive runs of the same problems, whereas robustness is evaluated via the performance across varying load and boundary conditions. A benchmark dataset, comprising eight beam analysis problems, is created to test the Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. Results show that, despite a qualitative understanding of structural mechanics, the LLM lacks the quantitative reliability and robustness for engineering applications. To address these limitations, a shift is proposed that reframes the structural analysis as code generation tasks. Accordingly, an LLM-empowered agent is developed that (a) integrates chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting to generate accurate OpeeSeesPy code, and (b) automatically executes the code to produce structural analysis results. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent achieves accuracy exceeding 99.0% on the benchmark dataset, exhibiting reliable and robust performance across diverse conditions. Ablation studies highlight the complete example and function usage examples as the primary contributors to the agent's enhanced performance.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Aligned Knowledge Distillation for Lightweight Spatiotemporal Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic flow, combustion dynamics, and weather forecasting, often require complex models that suffer from low training efficiency and high memory consumption. This paper proposes a lightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD), which transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex teacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher model follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its latent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency trends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler). However, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in slow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a frequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale spectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low frequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both local fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental results show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions of up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset. The framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term trends while reducing computational complexity.

      <title>Towards a Comparative Framework for Compositional AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DisCoCirc framework for natural language processing allows the construction of compositional models of text, by combining units for individual words together according to the grammatical structure of the text. The compositional nature of a model can give rise to two things: compositional generalisation -- the ability of a model to generalise outside its training distribution by learning compositional rules underpinning the entire data distribution -- and compositional interpretability -- making sense of how the model works by inspecting its modular components in isolation, as well as the processes through which these components are combined. We present these notions in a framework-agnostic way using the language of category theory, and adapt a series of tests for compositional generalisation to this setting.
  Applying this to the DisCoCirc framework, we consider how well a selection of models can learn to compositionally generalise. We compare both quantum circuit based models, as well as classical neural networks, on a dataset derived from one of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of compositionality. Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the productivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ by at least 10% for the systematicity task, and exhibit different trends on the overgeneralisation tasks. Overall, we find the neural models are more prone to overfitting the Train data. Additionally, we demonstrate how to interpret a compositional model on one of the trained models. By considering how the model components interact with one another, we explain how the model behaves.</description>

      <title>GameTileNet: A Semantic Dataset for Low-Resolution Game Art in Procedural Content Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GameTileNet is a dataset designed to provide semantic labels for low-resolution digital game art, advancing procedural content generation (PCG) and related AI research as a vision-language alignment task. Large Language Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However, generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods, supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images.
  TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles designed to support narrative-driven procedural content generation through visual-language alignment.</description>

      <title>Control Synthesis in Partially Observable Environments for Complex Perception-Related Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perception-related tasks often arise in autonomous systems operating under partial observability. This work studies the problem of synthesizing optimal policies for complex perception-related objectives in environments modeled by partially observable Markov decision processes. To formally specify such objectives, we introduce \emph{co-safe linear inequality temporal logic} (sc-iLTL), which can define complex tasks that are formed by the logical concatenation of atomic propositions as linear inequalities on the belief space of the POMDPs. Our solution to the control synthesis problem is to transform the \mbox{sc-iLTL} objectives into reachability objectives by constructing the product of the belief MDP and a deterministic finite automaton built from the sc-iLTL objective. To overcome the scalability challenge due to the product, we introduce a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method that converges in probability to the optimal policy. Finally, a drone-probing case study demonstrates the applicability of our method.</description>

      <title>SPEAR: Structured Pruning for Spiking Neural Networks via Synaptic Operation Estimation and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) demonstrate superior performance, their deployment on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware still remains challenging. Network pruning offers a viable solution by reducing both parameters and synaptic operations (SynOps) to facilitate the edge deployment of SNNs, among which search-based pruning methods search for the SNNs structure after pruning. However, existing search-based methods fail to directly use SynOps as the constraint because it will dynamically change in the searching process, resulting in the final searched network violating the expected SynOps target. In this paper, we introduce a novel SNN pruning framework called SPEAR, which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) technique to directly use SynOps as the searching constraint. To avoid the violation of SynOps requirements, we first propose a SynOps prediction mechanism called LRE to accurately predict the final SynOps after search. Observing SynOps cannot be explicitly calculated and added to constrain the action in RL, we propose a novel reward called TAR to stabilize the searching. Extensive experiments show that our SPEAR framework can effectively compress SNN under specific SynOps constraint.</description>

      <title>Iterative Zoom-In: Temporal Interval Exploration for Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in video understanding tasks. However, they continue to struggle with long-form videos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike humans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate query-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling across the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of missing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal Search, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal regions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key observation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal intervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through two main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is likely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of frames from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model to produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the model by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal intervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally, keyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval perception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce TS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree. Each node represents a candidate interval and is expanded via two methods: self-driven proposals and uniform partitioning. Nodes are scored based on confidence and self-evaluation, and the most promising one is selected for continued exploration.</description>

      <title>DriveMRP: Enhancing Vision-Language Models with Synthetic Motion Data for Motion Risk Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen significant progress, driven by extensive real-world data. However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle, other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to 68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Evaluating AI Counseling in Japanese: Counselor, Client, and Evaluator Roles Assessed by Motivational Interviewing Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02950v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of large language model (LLM) performance across three counseling roles in Japanese-language therapeutic contexts. We simultaneously assessed counselor artificial intelligence (AI) systems (GPT-4-turbo with zeroshot prompting or Structured Multi-step Dialogue Prompts (SMDP), Claude-3-Opus-SMDP), client AI simulations, and evaluation AI systems (o3, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-pro). Human experts (n = 15) with extensive counseling experience evaluated AI-generated dialogues using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding Manual 4.2.1.
  Notably, SMDP implementation significantly enhanced counselor AI performance across all MITI global ratings compared with zeroshot prompting, with no significant differences between GPT-SMDP and Opus-SMDP. Evaluation AIs showed comparable performance to human raters for Cultivating Change Talk but systematically overestimated Softening Sustain Talk and the overall quality metrics. Model-specific biases emerged: Gemini emphasized power-sharing, o3 focused on technical proficiency, and Sonnet prioritized emotional expression. Client AI simulations exhibited a limited emotional range and unnaturally high compliance, indicating the need for enhanced realism.
  These findings establish benchmarks for AI-assisted counseling in non-English contexts and identify critical areas for improvement through advanced prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and targeted fine-tuning, with important implications for developing culturally sensitive AI mental health tools.</description>

      <title>Bittensor Protocol: The Bitcoin in Decentralized Artificial Intelligence? A Critical and Empirical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates whether Bittensor can be considered the Bitcoin of decentralized Artificial Intelligence by directly comparing its tokenomics, decentralization properties, consensus mechanism, and incentive structure against those of Bitcoin. Leveraging on-chain data from all 64 active Bittensor subnets, we first document considerable concentration in both stake and rewards. We further show that rewards are overwhelmingly driven by stake, highlighting a clear misalignment between quality and compensation. As a remedy, we put forward a series of two-pronged protocol-level interventions. For incentive realignment, our proposed solutions include performance-weighted emission split, composite scoring, and a trust-bonus multiplier. As for mitigating security vulnerability due to stake concentration, we propose and empirically validate stake cap at the 88th percentile, which elevates the median coalition size required for a 51-percent attack and remains robust across daily, weekly, and monthly snapshots.</description>

Abstract: We investigate various strategic locations of shops in shopping malls in a metropolis with the aim of finding the best strategy for final dominance of market share by a company in a competing environment. The problem is posed in the context of two competing supermarket chains in a metropolis, described in the framework of the two-dimensional Ising model. Evolutionary Algorithm is used to encode the ensemble of initial configurations and Monte Carlo method is used to evolve the pattern. Numerical simulation indicates that initial patterns with certain topological properties do evolve faster to market dominance. The description of these topological properties is given and suggestions are made on the initial pattern so as to evolve faster to market dominance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As financial institutions increasingly adopt Large Language Models (LLMs), rigorous domain-specific evaluation becomes critical for responsible deployment. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 23 state-of-the-art LLMs on the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Level III exam - the gold standard for advanced financial reasoning. We assess both multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and essay-style responses using multiple prompting strategies including Chain-of-Thought and Self-Discover. Our evaluation reveals that leading models demonstrate strong capabilities, with composite scores such as 79.1% (o4-mini) and 77.3% (Gemini 2.5 Flash) on CFA Level III. These results, achieved under a revised, stricter essay grading methodology, indicate significant progress in LLM capabilities for high-stakes financial applications. Our findings provide crucial guidance for practitioners on model selection and highlight remaining challenges in cost-effective deployment and the need for nuanced interpretation of performance against professional benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Representation Engineering Perspective on the Effectiveness of Multi-Turn Jailbreaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that state-of-the-art LLMs and defenses remain susceptible to multi-turn jailbreak attacks. These attacks require only closed-box model access and are often easy to perform manually, posing a significant threat to the safe and secure deployment of LLM-based systems. We study the effectiveness of the Crescendo multi-turn jailbreak at the level of intermediate model representations and find that safety-aligned LMs often represent Crescendo responses as more benign than harmful, especially as the number of conversation turns increases. Our analysis indicates that at each turn, Crescendo prompts tend to keep model outputs in a "benign" region of representation space, effectively tricking the model into fulfilling harmful requests. Further, our results help explain why single-turn jailbreak defenses like circuit breakers are generally ineffective against multi-turn attacks, motivating the development of mitigations that address this generalization gap.</description>

      <title>A Novel Active Learning Approach to Label One Million Unknown Malware Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active learning for classification seeks to reduce the cost of labeling samples by finding unlabeled examples about which the current model is least certain and sending them to an annotator/expert to label. Bayesian theory can provide a probabilistic view of deep neural network models by asserting a prior distribution over model parameters and estimating the uncertainties by posterior distribution over these parameters. This paper proposes two novel active learning approaches to label one million malware examples belonging to different unknown modern malware families. The first model is Inception-V4+PCA combined with several support vector machine (SVM) algorithms (UTSVM, PSVM, SVM-GSU, TBSVM). The second model is Vision Transformer based Bayesian Neural Networks ViT-BNN. Our proposed ViT-BNN is a state-of-the-art active learning approach that differs from current methods and can apply to any particular task. The experiments demonstrate that the ViT-BNN is more stable and robust in handling uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Low-Latency Spiking Neural Networks Utilizing Historical Dynamics of Refractory Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The refractory period controls neuron spike firing rate, crucial for network stability and noise resistance. With advancements in spiking neural network (SNN) training methods, low-latency SNN applications have expanded. In low-latency SNNs, shorter simulation steps render traditional refractory mechanisms, which rely on empirical distributions or spike firing rates, less effective. However, omitting the refractory period amplifies the risk of neuron over-activation and reduces the system's robustness to noise. To address this challenge, we propose a historical dynamic refractory period (HDRP) model that leverages membrane potential derivative with historical refractory periods to estimate an initial refractory period and dynamically adjust its duration. Additionally, we propose a threshold-dependent refractory kernel to mitigate excessive neuron state accumulation. Our approach retains the binary characteristics of SNNs while enhancing both noise resistance and overall performance. Experimental results show that HDRP-SNN significantly reduces redundant spikes compared to traditional SNNs, and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy both on static datasets and neuromorphic datasets. Moreover, HDRP-SNN outperforms artificial neural networks (ANNs) and traditional SNNs in noise resistance, highlighting the crucial role of the HDRP mechanism in enhancing the performance of low-latency SNNs.</description>

      <title>Flow-Through Tensors: A Unified Computational Graph Architecture for Multi-Layer Transportation Network Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern transportation network modeling increasingly involves the integration of diverse methodologies including sensor-based forecasting, reinforcement learning, classical flow optimization, and demand modeling that have traditionally been developed in isolation. This paper introduces Flow Through Tensors (FTT), a unified computational graph architecture that connects origin destination flows, path probabilities, and link travel times as interconnected tensors. Our framework makes three key contributions: first, it establishes a consistent mathematical structure that enables gradient-based optimization across previously separate modeling elements; second, it supports multidimensional analysis of traffic patterns over time, space, and user groups with precise quantification of system efficiency; third, it implements tensor decomposition techniques that maintain computational tractability for large scale applications. These innovations collectively enable real time control strategies, efficient coordination between multiple transportation modes and operators, and rigorous enforcement of physical network constraints. The FTT framework bridges the gap between theoretical transportation models and practical deployment needs, providing a foundation for next generation integrated mobility systems.</description>

      <title>RAG-R1 : Incentivize the Search and Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs through Multi-query Parallelism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02962v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, while they remain prone to generating hallucinated or outdated responses due to their static internal knowledge. Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have explored enhancing models' search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and restricted capabilities due to the single-query mode. In this paper, we propose RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, aimed at reducing inference time and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.</description>

      <title>Less Data, More Security: Advancing Cybersecurity LLMs Specialization via Resource-Efficient Domain-Adaptive Continuous Pre-training with Minimal Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional natural language capabilities, general-purpose models lack specialized domain knowledge for effective cybersecurity analysis. In this work, we investigate Domain-Adaptive Continuous Pretraining (DAP) as a methodology for enhancing cybersecurity understanding in pretrained LLMs while preserving general language capabilities. We systematically adapted three decoder-based architectures -- Llama-3.1-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct -- using a curated 126-million-word cybersecurity corpus from standards, academic literature, and various other sources. Our approach employed constrained training parameters and distributed FSDP training to balance domain specialization with knowledge preservation. Evaluation across three cybersecurity benchmarks, namely, CTI-MCQ, CyberMetric, and SecEval, demonstrates consistent improvements post-adaptation. The Llama-3.3-70B-Ins-DAP model achieved state-of-the-art accuracies of 0.718, 0.933, and 0.864, respectively, outperforming specialized models, including Llama-Primus-Base. Notably, competitive performance was achieved using substantially smaller datasets (118.8 million versus 2.77 billion tokens), demonstrating efficient domain specialization viability. We establish that targeted continuous pretraining enables effective cybersecurity domain adaptation with computational feasibility, providing foundations for specialized AI assistants in threat analysis, vulnerability assessment, and security documentation while challenging prevailing assumptions about data requirements for LLM specialization.</description>

      <title>Concept-based Adversarial Attack: a Probabilistic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a concept-based adversarial attack framework that extends beyond single-image perturbations by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Rather than modifying a single image, our method operates on an entire concept -- represented by a probabilistic generative model or a set of images -- to generate diverse adversarial examples. Preserving the concept is essential, as it ensures that the resulting adversarial images remain identifiable as instances of the original underlying category or identity. By sampling from this concept-based adversarial distribution, we generate images that maintain the original concept but vary in pose, viewpoint, or background, thereby misleading the classifier. Mathematically, this framework remains consistent with traditional adversarial attacks in a principled manner. Our theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that concept-based adversarial attacks yield more diverse adversarial examples and effectively preserve the underlying concept, while achieving higher attack efficiency.</description>

      <title>PB-LLMs: Privacy- and Bias-aware NLP Models using Named-Entity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in high-stakes AI-based applications has increased significantly in recent years, especially since the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, despite their strong performance, LLMs introduce important legal/ethical concerns, particularly regarding privacy, data protection, and transparency. Due to these concerns, this work explores the use of Named-Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the privacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework that uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data, such as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the proposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its impact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and sensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes. The study involved two language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and six anonymization algorithms (based on Presidio, FLAIR, BERT, and different versions of GPT) applied to a database of 24,000 candidate profiles. The findings indicate that the proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system performance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate confidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario. On top of the proposed privacy-preserving approach, we also experiment applying an existing approach that reduces the gender bias in LLMs, thus finally obtaining our proposed Privacy- and Bias-aware LLMs (PB-LLMs). Note that the proposed PB-LLMs have been evaluated in a particular setup (resume scoring), but are generally applicable to any other LLM-based AI application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Condition monitoring subsea pipelines in low-visibility underwater environments poses significant challenges due to turbidity, light distortion, and image degradation. Traditional visual-based inspection systems often fail to provide reliable data for mapping, object recognition, or defect detection in such conditions. This study explores the integration of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance image quality, detect pipeline structures, and support autonomous fault diagnosis. This study conducts a comparative analysis of two most robust versions of YOLOv8 and Yolov11 and their three variants tailored for image segmentation tasks in complex and low-visibility subsea environments. Using pipeline inspection datasets captured beneath the seabed, it evaluates model performance in accurately delineating target structures under challenging visual conditions. The results indicated that YOLOv11 outperformed YOLOv8 in overall performance.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Privacy Policy Complexity: An Exploratory Study Using Graph Mining, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Privacy policy documents are often lengthy, complex, and difficult for non-expert users to interpret, leading to a lack of transparency regarding the collection, processing, and sharing of personal data. As concerns over online privacy grow, it is essential to develop automated tools capable of analyzing privacy policies and identifying potential risks. In this study, we explore the potential of interactive graph visualizations to enhance user understanding of privacy policies by representing policy terms as structured graph models. This approach makes complex relationships more accessible and enables users to make informed decisions about their personal data (RQ1). We also employ graph mining algorithms to identify key themes, such as User Activity and Device Information, using dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE and PCA to assess clustering effectiveness. Our findings reveal that graph-based clustering improves policy content interpretability. It highlights patterns in user tracking and data sharing, which supports forensic investigations and identifies regulatory non-compliance. This research advances AI-driven tools for auditing privacy policies by integrating interactive visualizations with graph mining. Enhanced transparency fosters accountability and trust.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to provide an innovative machine learning-based solution to automate security testing tasks for web applications, ensuring the correct functioning of all components while reducing project maintenance costs. Reinforcement Learning is proposed to select and prioritize tools and optimize the testing path. The presented approach utilizes a simulated webpage along with its network topology to train the agent. Additionally, the model leverages Geometric Deep Learning to create priors that reduce the search space and improve learning convergence. The validation and testing process was conducted on real-world vulnerable web pages commonly used by human hackers for learning. As a result of this study, a reinforcement learning algorithm was developed that maximizes the number of vulnerabilities found while minimizing the number of steps required</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for transforming digital health by enabling automated medical question answering. However, ensuring these models meet critical industry standards for factual accuracy, usefulness, and safety remains a challenge, especially for open-source solutions. We present a rigorous benchmarking framework using a dataset of over 1,000 health questions. We assess model performance across honesty, helpfulness, and harmlessness. Our results highlight trade-offs between factual reliability and safety among evaluated models -- Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B-DARE, and AlpaCare-13B. AlpaCare-13B achieves the highest accuracy (91.7%) and harmlessness (0.92), while domain-specific tuning in BioMistral-7B-DARE boosts safety (0.90) despite its smaller scale. Few-shot prompting improves accuracy from 78% to 85%, and all models show reduced helpfulness on complex queries, highlighting ongoing challenges in clinical QA.</description>

      <title>Gated Recursive Fusion: A Stateful Approach to Scalable Multimodal Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning faces a fundamental tension between deep, fine-grained fusion and computational scalability. While cross-attention models achieve strong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic complexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this challenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures the power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent pipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving multimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion block built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric cross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming modality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit (GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow, enabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful, recurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it ideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark demonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex baselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF creates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive fusion mechanism. Our work presents a robust and efficient paradigm for powerful, scalable multimodal representation learning.</description>

      <title>`For Argument's Sake, Show Me How to Harm Myself!': Jailbreaking LLMs in Suicide and Self-Harm Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to increasingly sophisticated safety protocols and features designed to prevent harmful, unethical, or unauthorized outputs. However, these guardrails remain susceptible to novel and creative forms of adversarial prompting, including manually generated test cases. In this work, we present two new test cases in mental health for (i) suicide and (ii) self-harm, using multi-step, prompt-level jailbreaking and bypass built-in content and safety filters. We show that user intent is disregarded, leading to the generation of detailed harmful content and instructions that could cause real-world harm. We conduct an empirical evaluation across six widely available LLMs, demonstrating the generalizability and reliability of the bypass. We assess these findings and the multilayered ethical tensions that they present for their implications on prompt-response filtering and context- and task-specific model development. We recommend a more comprehensive and systematic approach to AI safety and ethics while emphasizing the need for continuous adversarial testing in safety-critical AI deployments. We also argue that while certain clearly defined safety measures and guardrails can and must be implemented in LLMs, ensuring robust and comprehensive safety across all use cases and domains remains extremely challenging given the current technical maturity of general-purpose LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning to perform activities through demonstration requires extracting meaningful information about the environment from observations. In this research, we investigate the challenge of planning high-level goal-oriented actions in a simulation setting from an egocentric perspective. We present a novel task, interactive action planning, and propose an approach that combines topological affordance memory with transformer architecture. The process of memorizing the environment's structure through extracting affordances facilitates selecting appropriate actions based on the context. Moreover, the memory model allows us to detect action deviations while accomplishing specific objectives. To assess the method's versatility, we evaluate it in a realistic interactive simulation environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach learns meaningful representations, resulting in improved performance and robust when action deviations occur.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Hierarchical Clinical Document Classification Using Reasoning-Based LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can classify ICD-10 codes from hospital discharge summaries, a critical but error-prone task in healthcare. Using 1,500 summaries from the MIMIC-IV dataset and focusing on the 10 most frequent ICD-10 codes, the study tested 11 LLMs, including models with and without structured reasoning capabilities. Medical terms were extracted using a clinical NLP tool (cTAKES), and models were prompted in a consistent, coder-like format. None of the models achieved an F1 score above 57%, with performance dropping as code specificity increased. Reasoning-based models generally outperformed non-reasoning ones, with Gemini 2.5 Pro performing best overall. Some codes, such as those related to chronic heart disease, were classified more accurately than others. The findings suggest that while LLMs can assist human coders, they are not yet reliable enough for full automation. Future work should explore hybrid methods, domain-specific model training, and the use of structured clinical data.</description>

      <title>Game-Theoretic Modeling of Vehicle Unprotected Left Turns Considering Drivers' Bounded Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the decision-making behavior of vehicles presents unique challenges, particularly during unprotected left turns at intersections, where the uncertainty of human drivers is especially pronounced. In this context, connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology emerges as a promising avenue for effectively managing such interactions while ensuring safety and efficiency. Traditional approaches, often grounded in game theory assumptions of perfect rationality, may inadequately capture the complexities of real-world scenarios and drivers' decision-making errors. To fill this gap, we propose a novel decision-making model for vehicle unprotected left-turn scenarios, integrating game theory with considerations for drivers' bounded rationality. Our model, formulated as a two-player normal-form game solved by a quantal response equilibrium (QRE), offers a more nuanced depiction of driver decision-making processes compared to Nash equilibrium (NE) models. Leveraging an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm coupled with a subtle neural network trained on precise microscopic vehicle trajectory data, we optimize model parameters to accurately reflect drivers' interaction-aware bounded rationality and driving styles. Through comprehensive simulation experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model in capturing the interaction-aware bounded rationality and decision tendencies between players. The proposed model proves to be more realistic and efficient than NE models in unprotected left-turn scenarios. Our findings contribute valuable insights into the vehicle decision-making behaviors with bounded rationality, thereby informing the development of more robust and realistic autonomous driving systems.</description>

Abstract: The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in education requires teachers to develop AI competencies while preparing students for a society influenced by AI. This study evaluates the impact of an online teacher training program on German in-service teachers' AI literacy, usage behaviors, and attitudes toward AI. A pre-post design study was conducted with teachers (N1 = 291 for AI literacy, N2 = 436 for attitude assessment) participating in the course. The program combined synchronous and asynchronous learning formats, including webinars, self-paced modules, and practical projects. The participants exhibited notable improvements across all domains: AI literacy scores increased significantly, and all attitude items regarding AI usage and integration demonstrated significant positive changes. Teachers reported increased confidence in AI integration. Structured teacher training programs effectively enhance AI literacy and foster positive attitudes toward AI in education.</description>

      <title>Challenges for AI in Multimodal STEM Assessments: a Human-AI Comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI systems have rapidly advanced, with multimodal input capabilities enabling reasoning beyond text-based tasks. In education, these advancements could influence assessment design and question answering, presenting both opportunities and challenges. To investigate these effects, we introduce a high-quality dataset of 201 university-level STEM questions, manually annotated with features such as image type, role, problem complexity, and question format. Our study analyzes how these features affect generative AI performance compared to students. We evaluate four model families with five prompting strategies, comparing results to the average of 546 student responses per question. Although the best model correctly answers on average 58.5 % of the questions using majority vote aggregation, human participants consistently outperform AI on questions involving visual components. Interestingly, human performance remains stable across question features but varies by subject, whereas AI performance is susceptible to both subject matter and question features. Finally, we provide actionable insights for educators, demonstrating how question design can enhance academic integrity by leveraging features that challenge current AI systems without increasing the cognitive burden for students.</description>

      <title>Completion of the DrugMatrix Toxicogenomics Database using 3-Dimensional Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore applying a tensor completion approach to complete the DrugMatrix toxicogenomics dataset. Our hypothesis is that by preserving the 3-dimensional structure of the data, which comprises tissue, treatment, and transcriptomic measurements, and by leveraging a machine learning formulation, our approach will improve upon prior state-of-the-art results. Our results demonstrate that the new tensor-based method more accurately reflects the original data distribution and effectively captures organ-specific variability. The proposed tensor-based methodology achieved lower mean squared errors and mean absolute errors compared to both conventional Canonical Polyadic decomposition and 2-dimensional matrix factorization methods. In addition, our non-negative tensor completion implementation reveals relationships among tissues. Our findings not only complete the world's largest in-vivo toxicogenomics database with improved accuracy but also offer a promising methodology for future studies of drugs that may cross species barriers, for example, from rats to humans.</description>

      <title>Generalized Adaptive Transfer Network: Enhancing Transfer Learning in Reinforcement Learning Across Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to leverage knowledge from source tasks to accelerate learning in target tasks. While prior work, such as the Attend, Adapt, and Transfer (A2T) framework, addresses negative transfer and selective transfer, other critical challenges remain underexplored. This paper introduces the Generalized Adaptive Transfer Network (GATN), a deep RL architecture designed to tackle task generalization across domains, robustness to environmental changes, and computational efficiency in transfer. GATN employs a domain-agnostic representation module, a robustness-aware policy adapter, and an efficient transfer scheduler to achieve these goals. We evaluate GATN on diverse benchmarks, including Atari 2600, MuJoCo, and a custom chatbot dialogue environment, demonstrating superior performance in cross-domain generalization, resilience to dynamic environments, and reduced computational overhead compared to baselines. Our findings suggest GATN is a versatile framework for real-world RL applications, such as adaptive chatbots and robotic control.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Forecasting of Hotel KPIs: A Cross-City Analysis of Global Urban Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast key performance indicators (KPIs), Occupancy (OCC), Average Daily Rate (ADR), and Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR), across five major cities: Manchester, Amsterdam, Dubai, Bangkok, and Mumbai. The cities were selected for their diverse economic profiles and hospitality dynamics. Monthly data from 2018 to 2025 were used, with 80% for training and 20% for testing. Advanced time series decomposition and machine learning techniques enabled accurate forecasting and trend identification. Results show that Manchester and Mumbai exhibited the highest predictive accuracy, reflecting stable demand patterns, while Dubai and Bangkok demonstrated higher variability due to seasonal and event-driven influences. The findings validate the effectiveness of LSTM models for urban hospitality forecasting and provide a comparative framework for data-driven decision-making. The models generalisability across global cities highlights its potential utility for tourism stakeholders and urban planners.</description>

      <title>On the Mathematical Impossibility of Safe Universal Approximators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish fundamental mathematical limits on universal approximation theorem (UAT) system alignment by proving that catastrophic failures are an inescapable feature of any useful computational system. Our central thesis is that for any universal approximator, the expressive power required for useful computation is inextricably linked to a dense set of instabilities that make perfect, reliable control a mathematical impossibility. We prove this through a three-level argument that leaves no escape routes for any class of universal approximator architecture. i) Combinatorial Necessity: For the vast majority of practical universal approximators (e.g., those using ReLU activations), we prove that the density of catastrophic failure points is directly proportional to the network's expressive power. ii) Topological Necessity: For any theoretical universal approximator, we use singularity theory to prove that the ability to approximate generic functions requires the ability to implement the dense, catastrophic singularities that characterize them. iii) Empirical Necessity: We prove that the universal existence of adversarial examples is empirical evidence that real-world tasks are themselves catastrophic, forcing any successful model to learn and replicate these instabilities. These results, combined with a quantitative "Impossibility Sandwich" showing that the minimum complexity for usefulness exceeds the maximum complexity for safety, demonstrate that perfect alignment is not an engineering challenge but a mathematical impossibility. This foundational result reframes UAT safety from a problem of "how to achieve perfect control" to one of "how to operate safely in the presence of irreducible uncontrollability," with profound implications for the future of UAT development and governance.</description>

      <title>Preserving Privacy, Increasing Accessibility, and Reducing Cost: An On-Device Artificial Intelligence Model for Medical Transcription and Note Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Clinical documentation represents a significant burden for healthcare providers, with physicians spending up to 2 hours daily on administrative tasks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions, but privacy concerns and computational requirements limit their adoption in healthcare settings. Objective: To develop and evaluate a privacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned Llama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical transcriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the browser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical transcription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the base Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140 modified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple clinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model demonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI benchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1 improved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked reduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual correctness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed on the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13 to 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical transcription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete on-device browser deployment. This approach addresses key barriers to AI adoption in healthcare: privacy preservation, cost reduction, and accessibility for resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Data Protection in the (Generative) Artificial Intelligence Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation, traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control, spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights, system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Cubic Regularized Second-Order Latent Factor Analysis Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data, characterized by massive node interactions, have become ubiquitous across various real-world applications. Second-order latent factor models have shown promising performance in modeling this type of data. Nevertheless, due to the bilinear and non-convex nature of the SLF model's objective function, incorporating a damping term into the Hessian approximation and carefully tuning associated parameters become essential. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new approach in this study, named the adaptive cubic regularized second-order latent factor analysis (ACRSLF) model. The proposed ACRSLF adopts the two-fold ideas: 1) self-tuning cubic regularization that dynamically mitigates non-convex optimization instabilities; 2) multi-Hessian-vector product evaluation during conjugate gradient iterations for precise second-order information assimilation. Comprehensive experiments on two industrial HDI datasets demonstrate that the ACRSLF converges faster and achieves higher representation accuracy than the advancing optimizer-based LFA models.</description>

      <title>Cautious Next Token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next token prediction paradigm has been prevailing for autoregressive models in the era of LLMs. The current default sampling choice for popular LLMs is temperature scaling together with nucleus sampling to balance diversity and coherence. Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various NLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end, we propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next Token Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has comparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple trials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any punctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed as the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The trial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the less confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is consistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident, one tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to cautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive experiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach outperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear margin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further improve over vanilla self consistency. We believe our proposed CNTP has the potential to become one of the default choices for LLM decoding. Code is available at https://github.com/wyzjack/CNTP.</description>

      <title>Optimas: Optimizing Compound AI Systems with Globally Aligned Local Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compound AI systems integrating multiple components, such as Large Language Models, specialized tools, and traditional machine learning models, are increasingly deployed to solve complex real-world tasks. However, optimizing compound systems remains challenging due to their non-differentiable structures and diverse configuration types across components, including prompts, hyperparameters, and model parameters. To address this challenge, we propose Optimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems. The core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per component, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each component's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each iteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while simultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables independent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated optimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead to performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world compound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an average improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for improving compound systems.

      <description>arXiv:2507.03042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory storage for Large Language models (LLMs) is becoming an increasingly active area of research, particularly for enabling personalization across long conversations. We propose Pref-LSTM, a dynamic and lightweight framework that combines a BERT-based classifier with a LSTM memory module that generates memory embedding which then is soft-prompt injected into a frozen LLM. We synthetically curate a dataset of preference and non-preference conversation turns to train our BERT-based classifier. Although our LSTM-based memory encoder did not yield strong results, we find that the BERT-based classifier performs reliably in identifying explicit and implicit user preferences. Our research demonstrates the viability of using preference filtering with LSTM gating principals as an efficient path towards scalable user preference modeling, without extensive overhead and fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>K-Function: Joint Pronunciation Transcription and Feedback for Evaluating Kids Language Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early evaluation of children's language is frustrated by the high pitch, long phones, and sparse data that derail automatic speech recognisers. We introduce K-Function, a unified framework that combines accurate sub-word transcription, objective scoring, and actionable feedback. Its core, Kids-WFST, merges a Wav2Vec2 phoneme encoder with a phoneme-similarity Dysfluent-WFST to capture child-specific errors while remaining fully interpretable. Kids-WFST attains 1.39% phoneme error on MyST and 8.61% on Multitudes--absolute gains of 10.47 and 7.06 points over a greedy-search decoder. These high-fidelity transcripts power an LLM that grades verbal skills, milestones, reading, and comprehension, aligning with human proctors and supplying tongue-and-lip visualizations plus targeted advice. The results show that precise phoneme recognition cements a complete diagnostic-feedback loop, paving the way for scalable, clinician-ready language assessment.</description>

Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence field has focused on developing optimisation methods to solve multiple problems, specifically problems that we thought to be only solvable through cognition. The obtained results have been outstanding, being able to even surpass the Turing Test. However, we have found that these optimisation methods share some fundamental flaws that impede them to become a true artificial cognition. Specifically, the field have identified catastrophic forgetting as a fundamental problem to develop such cognition. This paper formally proves that this problem is inherent to optimisation methods, and as such it will always limit approaches that try to solve the Artificial General Intelligence problem as an optimisation problem. Additionally, it addresses the problem of overfitting and discuss about other smaller problems that optimisation methods pose. Finally, it empirically shows how world-modelling methods avoid suffering from either problem. As a conclusion, the field of Artificial Intelligence needs to look outside the machine learning field to find methods capable of developing an artificial cognition.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Tuning for Temporal Sensitivity Enhancement in Large Language Model-based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances have applied large language models (LLMs) to sequential recommendation, leveraging their pre-training knowledge and reasoning capabilities to provide more personalized user experiences. However, existing LLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information inherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental architectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention mechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings designed primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences. This limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of user preferences over time and predict future interests accurately.
  To address this critical gap, we propose Counterfactual Enhanced Temporal Framework for LLM-Based Recommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal inference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact of temporal information on recommendation outcomes. By conceptualizing temporal order as an independent causal factor distinct from item content, we can quantify its unique contribution through counterfactual reasoning--comparing what recommendations would be made with and without temporal information while keeping all other factors constant. This causal framing enables CETRec to design a novel counterfactual tuning objective that directly optimizes the model's temporal sensitivity, teaching LLMs to recognize both absolute timestamps and relative ordering patterns in user histories. Combined with our counterfactual tuning task derived from causal analysis, CETRec effectively enhances LLMs' awareness of both absolute order (how recently items were interacted with) and relative order (the sequential relationships between items).</description>

Abstract: Machine-learned systems are in widespread use for making decisions about humans, and it is important that they are fair, i.e., not biased against individuals based on sensitive attributes.
  We present a general framework of runtime verification of algorithmic fairness for systems whose models are unknown, but are assumed to have a Markov chain structure, with or without full observation of the state space.
  We introduce a specification language that can model many common algorithmic fairness properties, such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, and social burden.
  We build monitors that observe a long sequence of events as generated by a given system, and output, after each observation, a quantitative estimate of how fair or biased the system was on that run until that point in time.
  The estimate is proven to be correct modulo a variable error bound and a given confidence level, where the error bound gets tighter as the observed sequence gets longer.
  We present two categories of monitoring algorithms, namely ones with a uniform error bound across all time points, and ones with weaker non-uniform, pointwise error bounds at different time points.
  Our monitoring algorithms use statistical tools that are adapted to suit the dynamic requirements of monitoring and the special needs of the fairness specifications.
  Using a prototype implementation, we show how we can monitor if a bank is fair in giving loans to applicants from different social backgrounds, and if a college is fair in admitting students while maintaining a reasonable financial burden on the society.
  In these experiments, our monitors took less than a millisecond to update their verdicts after each observation.</description>

Abstract: In the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), a fundamental challenge is to facilitate human understanding of robots. The emerging domain of eXplainable HRI (XHRI) investigates methods to generate explanations and evaluate their impact on human-robot interactions. Previous works have highlighted the need to personalise the level of detail of these explanations to enhance usability and comprehension. Our paper presents a framework designed to update and retrieve user knowledge-memory models, allowing for adapting the explanations' level of detail while referencing previously acquired concepts. Three architectures based on our proposed framework that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated in two distinct scenarios: a hospital patrolling robot and a kitchen assistant robot. Experimental results demonstrate that a two-stage architecture, which first generates an explanation and then personalises it, is the framework architecture that effectively reduces the level of detail only when there is related user knowledge.</description>

      <title>From Turing to Tomorrow: The UK's Approach to AI Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The UK has pursued a distinctive path in AI regulation: less cautious than the EU but more willing to address risks than the US, and has emerged as a global leader in coordinating AI safety efforts. Impressive developments from companies like London-based DeepMind began to spark concerns in the UK about catastrophic risks from around 2012, although regulatory discussion at the time focussed on bias and discrimination. By 2022, these discussions had evolved into a "pro-innovation" strategy, in which the government directed existing regulators to take a light-touch approach, governing AI at point of use, but avoided regulating the technology or infrastructure directly. ChatGPT arrived in late 2022, galvanising concerns that this approach may be insufficient. The UK responded by establishing an AI Safety Institute to monitor risks and hosting the first international AI Safety Summit in 2023, but - unlike the EU - refrained from regulating frontier AI development in addition to its use. A new government was elected in 2024 which promised to address this gap, but at the time of writing is yet to do so.
  What should the UK do next? The government faces competing objectives: harnessing AI for economic growth and better public services while mitigating risk. In light of these, we propose establishing a flexible, principles-based regulator to oversee the most advanced AI development, defensive measures against risks from AI-enabled biological design tools, and argue that more technical work is needed to understand how to respond to AI-generated misinformation. We argue for updated legal frameworks on copyright, discrimination, and AI agents, and that regulators will have a limited but important role if AI substantially disrupts labour markets.
  If the UK gets AI regulation right, it could demonstrate how democratic societies can harness AI's benefits while managing its risks.</description>

      <title>Improving LLM Reasoning for Vulnerability Detection via Group Relative Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving and understanding the training dynamics and reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become essential for their deployment in AI-based security tools, such as software vulnerability detection. In this work, we present an extensive study aimed at advancing recent RL-based finetuning techniques for LLMs in the context of vulnerability detection.
  We start by highlighting key limitations of commonly adopted LLMs, such as their tendency to over-predict certain types of vulnerabilities while failing to detect others. To address this challenge, we explore the use of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent policy-gradient method, for guiding LLM behavior through structured, rule-based rewards. We enable its application to the vulnerability detection task by redefining its advantage functions and reward signals using annotations from widely used datasets in the field, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and CleanVul.
  The proposed methodology enables an extensive set of experiments, addressing multiple research questions regarding the impact of GRPO on generalization, reasoning capabilities, and performance improvements over standard supervised finetuning (SFT). Our findings offer valuable insights into the potential of RL-based training to enhance both the performance and reasoning abilities of LLMs in the context of software vulnerability detection.</description>

      <title>From 2:4 to 8:16 sparsity patterns in LLMs for Outliers and Weights with Variance Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in size, efficient compression techniques like quantization and sparsification are critical. While quantization maintains performance with reduced precision, structured sparsity methods, such as N:M sparsification, often fall short due to limited flexibility, and sensitivity to outlier weights. We explore 8:16 semi-structured sparsity, demonstrating its ability to surpass the Performance Threshold-where a compressed model matches the accuracy of its uncompressed or smaller counterpart under equivalent memory constraints. Compared to 2:4 sparsity, 8:16 offers greater flexibility with minimal storage overhead (0.875 vs. 0.75 bits/element). We also apply sparse structured patterns for salient weights, showing that structured sparsity for outliers is competitive with unstructured approaches leading to equivalent or better results. Finally, we demonstrate that simple techniques such as variance correction and SmoothQuant like weight equalization improve sparse models performance.</description>

      <title>LATTE: Latent Trajectory Embedding for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This can erode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable detectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising cues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the inherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the evolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling the trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE captures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated images. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature refinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it is fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on several established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover, it demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets settings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent embeddings for generated image detection. The code is available on the following link: https://github.com/AnaMVasilcoiu/LATTE-Diffusion-Detector.</description>

      <title>Automated Grading of Students' Handwritten Graphs: A Comparison of Meta-Learning and Vision-Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of online learning, the demand for efficient and consistent assessment in mathematics has significantly increased over the past decade. Machine Learning (ML), particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), has been widely used for autograding student responses, particularly those involving text and/or mathematical expressions. However, there has been limited research on autograding responses involving students' handwritten graphs, despite their prevalence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) curricula. In this study, we implement multimodal meta-learning models for autograding images containing students' handwritten graphs and text. We further compare the performance of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with these specially trained metalearning models. Our results, evaluated on a real-world dataset collected from our institution, show that the best-performing meta-learning models outperform VLLMs in 2-way classification tasks. In contrast, in more complex 3-way classification tasks, the best-performing VLLMs slightly outperform the meta-learning models. While VLLMs show promising results, their reliability and practical applicability remain uncertain and require further investigation.</description>

      <title>AI-Based Reconstruction from Inherited Personal Data: Analysis, Feasibility, and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores the feasibility of creating an "electronic copy" of a deceased researcher by training artificial intelligence (AI) on the data stored in their personal computers. By analyzing typical data volumes on inherited researcher computers, including textual files such as articles, emails, and drafts, it is estimated that approximately one million words are available for AI training. This volume is sufficient for fine-tuning advanced pre-trained models like GPT-4 to replicate a researcher's writing style, domain expertise, and rhetorical voice with high fidelity. The study also discusses the potential enhancements from including non-textual data and file metadata to enrich the AI's representation of the researcher. Extensions of the concept include communication between living researchers and their electronic copies, collaboration among individual electronic copies, as well as the creation and interconnection of organizational electronic copies to optimize information access and strategic decision-making. Ethical considerations such as ownership and security of these electronic copies are highlighted as critical for responsible implementation. The findings suggest promising opportunities for AI-driven preservation and augmentation of intellectual legacy.</description>

      <title>BERT4Traj: Transformer Based Trajectory Reconstruction for Sparse Mobility Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding human mobility is essential for applications in public health, transportation, and urban planning. However, mobility data often suffers from sparsity due to limitations in data collection methods, such as infrequent GPS sampling or call detail record (CDR) data that only capture locations during communication events. To address this challenge, we propose BERT4Traj, a transformer based model that reconstructs complete mobility trajectories by predicting hidden visits in sparse movement sequences. Inspired by BERT's masked language modeling objective and self_attention mechanisms, BERT4Traj leverages spatial embeddings, temporal embeddings, and contextual background features such as demographics and anchor points. We evaluate BERT4Traj on real world CDR and GPS datasets collected in Kampala, Uganda, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms traditional models such as Markov Chains, KNN, RNNs, and LSTMs. Our results show that BERT4Traj effectively reconstructs detailed and continuous mobility trajectories, enhancing insights into human movement patterns.</description>

      <title>LLM-Driven Auto Configuration for Transient IoT Device Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today's Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved from simple sensing and actuation devices to those with embedded processing and intelligent services, enabling rich collaborations between users and their devices. However, enabling such collaboration becomes challenging when transient devices need to interact with host devices in temporarily visited environments. In such cases, fine-grained access control policies are necessary to ensure secure interactions; however, manually implementing them is often impractical for non-expert users. Moreover, at run-time, the system must automatically configure the devices and enforce such fine-grained access control rules. Additionally, the system must address the heterogeneity of devices.
  In this paper, we present CollabIoT, a system that enables secure and seamless device collaboration in transient IoT environments. CollabIoT employs a Large language Model (LLM)-driven approach to convert users' high-level intents to fine-grained access control policies. To support secure and seamless device collaboration, CollabIoT adopts capability-based access control for authorization and uses lightweight proxies for policy enforcement, providing hardware-independent abstractions.
  We implement a prototype of CollabIoT's policy generation and auto configuration pipelines and evaluate its efficacy on an IoT testbed and in large-scale emulated environments. We show that our LLM-based policy generation pipeline is able to generate functional and correct policies with 100% accuracy. At runtime, our evaluation shows that our system configures new devices in ~150 ms, and our proxy-based data plane incurs network overheads of up to 2 ms and access control overheads up to 0.3 ms.</description>

      <title>Identification of Potentially Misclassified Crash Narratives using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research investigates the efficacy of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods in detecting misclassified intersection-related crashes in police-reported narratives. Using 2019 crash data from the Iowa Department of Transportation, we implemented and compared a comprehensive set of models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, BERT Sentence Embeddings, BERT Word Embeddings, and Albert Model. Model performance was systematically validated against expert reviews of potentially misclassified narratives, providing a rigorous assessment of classification accuracy. Results demonstrated that while traditional ML methods exhibited superior overall performance compared to some DL approaches, the Albert Model achieved the highest agreement with expert classifications (73% with Expert 1) and original tabular data (58%). Statistical analysis revealed that the Albert Model maintained performance levels similar to inter-expert consistency rates, significantly outperforming other approaches, particularly on ambiguous narratives. This work addresses a critical gap in transportation safety research through multi-modal integration analysis, which achieved a 54.2% reduction in error rates by combining narrative text with structured crash data. We conclude that hybrid approaches combining automated classification with targeted expert review offer a practical methodology for improving crash data quality, with substantial implications for transportation safety management and policy development.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Automating Clinical Data Standardization: HL7 FHIR Use Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For years, semantic interoperability standards have sought to streamline the exchange of clinical data, yet their deployment remains time-consuming, resource-intensive, and technically challenging. To address this, we introduce a semi-automated approach that leverages large language models specifically GPT-4o and Llama 3.2 405b to convert structured clinical datasets into HL7 FHIR format while assessing accuracy, reliability, and security. Applying our method to the MIMIC-IV database, we combined embedding techniques, clustering algorithms, and semantic retrieval to craft prompts that guide the models in mapping each tabular field to its corresponding FHIR resource. In an initial benchmark, resource identification achieved a perfect F1-score, with GPT-4o outperforming Llama 3.2 thanks to the inclusion of FHIR resource schemas within the prompt. Under real-world conditions, accuracy dipped slightly to 94 %, but refinements to the prompting strategy restored robust mappings. Error analysis revealed occasional hallucinations of non-existent attributes and mismatches in granularity, which more detailed prompts can mitigate. Overall, our study demonstrates the feasibility of context-aware, LLM-driven transformation of clinical data into HL7 FHIR, laying the groundwork for semi-automated interoperability workflows. Future work will focus on fine-tuning models with specialized medical corpora, extending support to additional standards such as HL7 CDA and OMOP, and developing an interactive interface to enable expert validation and iterative refinement.</description>

      <title>ARF-RLHF: Adaptive Reward-Following for RLHF through Emotion-Driven Self-Supervision and Trace-Biased Dynamic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and autoregressive transformers, state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4.0, DeepSeek R1, and Llama 3.3 increasingly emphasize answer depth and personalization. However, most existing RLHF approaches (e.g., PPO, DPO) still rely on a binary-preference (BT) paradigm, which, while reducing annotation costs, still requires substantial human effort and captures only group-level tendencies rather than individual preferences. To overcome these limitations, we propose Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), a self-assessment framework that leverages a high-precision emotion analyzer achieving over 70% accuracy on GoEmotions, Sentiment140, and DailyDialog to convert free-form user feedback into continuous preference scores. We further enrich and debias these signals through lightweight data augmentations, including synonym replacement, random trace truncation, and score bias annotation algorithm. A Dynamic Adapter Preference Tracker continuously models evolving user tastes in real time, enabling our novel Trace Bias (TB) fine-tuning algorithm to optimize directly on these tracked rewards instead of coarse binary labels. Experiments on Qwen-2/2.5, Gemma-2, and Llama-3.2 across four preference domains demonstrate that ARF achieves an improvement of 3.3% over PPO and 7.6% over DPO. Moreover, TB preserves theoretical alignment with PPO and DPO objectives. Overall, ARF presents a scalable, personalized, and cost-effective approach to RLHF LLMs through autonomous reward modeling.</description>

      <title>RLVER: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Emotion Rewards for Empathetic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at logical and algorithmic reasoning, yet their emotional intelligence (EQ) still lags far behind their cognitive prowess. While reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced in other domains, its application to dialogue-especially for emotional intelligence-remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce RLVER, the first end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifiable emotion rewards from simulated users to cultivate higher-order empathetic abilities in LLMs. Within this framework, self-consistent affective simulated users engage in dialogue rollouts and produce deterministic emotion scores during conversations, serving as reward signals to guide the LLM's learning. Fine-tuning publicly available Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model with PPO boosts its Sentient-Benchmark score from 13.3 to 79.2 while largely preserving mathematical and coding competence. Extensive experiments reveal that: (i) RLVER consistently improves multiple dialogue capabilities; (ii) Thinking and non-thinking models show distinct trends--thinking models excel in empathy and insight, while non-thinking models favor action; (iii) GRPO often yields stable gains, while PPO can push certain capabilities to a higher ceiling; (iv) More challenging environments are not always better-moderate ones can yield stronger outcomes. Our results show that RLVER is a practical route toward emotionally intelligent and broadly capable language agents.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.</description>

      <title>How Overconfidence in Initial Choices and Underconfidence Under Criticism Modulate Change of Mind in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strikingly conflicting behaviors: they can appear steadfastly overconfident in their initial answers whilst at the same time being prone to excessive doubt when challenged. To investigate this apparent paradox, we developed a novel experimental paradigm, exploiting the unique ability to obtain confidence estimates from LLMs without creating memory of their initial judgments -- something impossible in human participants. We show that LLMs -- Gemma 3, GPT4o and o1-preview -- exhibit a pronounced choice-supportive bias that reinforces and boosts their estimate of confidence in their answer, resulting in a marked resistance to change their mind. We further demonstrate that LLMs markedly overweight inconsistent compared to consistent advice, in a fashion that deviates qualitatively from normative Bayesian updating. Finally, we demonstrate that these two mechanisms -- a drive to maintain consistency with prior commitments and hypersensitivity to contradictory feedback -- parsimoniously capture LLM behavior in a different domain. Together, these findings furnish a mechanistic account of LLM confidence that explains both their stubbornness and excessive sensitivity to criticism.</description>

      <title>On the Relationship between Accent Strength and Articulatory Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between accent strength and articulatory features inferred from acoustic speech. To quantify accent strength, we compare phonetic transcriptions with transcriptions based on dictionary-based references, computing phoneme-level difference as a measure of accent strength. The proposed framework leverages recent self-supervised learning articulatory inversion techniques to estimate articulatory features. Analyzing a corpus of read speech from American and British English speakers, this study examines correlations between derived articulatory parameters and accent strength proxies, associating systematic articulatory differences with indexed accent strength. Results indicate that tongue positioning patterns distinguish the two dialects, with notable differences inter-dialects in rhotic and low back vowels. These findings contribute to automated accent analysis and articulatory modeling for speech processing applications.</description>

      <title>Expert-level validation of AI-generated medical text with scalable language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because 1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often unavailable in real-world settings. While the "LM-as-judge" paradigm (a LM evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we propose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a dataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a physician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6 diverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source, proprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly improves (p &lt; 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks, increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety classification scores up to 86%. MedVAL improves the performance of even the best-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8%. To support a scalable, risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration, we open-source the 1) codebase ( https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/MedVAL ), 2) MedVAL-Bench ( https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-Bench ), and 3) MedVAL-4B ( https://huggingface.co/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-4B ), the best-performing open-source LM. Our research provides the first evidence of LMs approaching expert-level validation ability for medical text.</description>

      <title>The Impact of LLM-Assistants on Software Developer Productivity: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model assistants (LLM-assistants) present new opportunities to transform software development. Developers are increasingly adopting these tools across tasks, including coding, testing, debugging, documentation, and design. Yet, despite growing interest, there is no synthesis of how LLM-assistants affect software developer productivity. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review of 37 peer-reviewed studies published between January 2014 and December 2024 that examine this impact. Our analysis reveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical risks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated development, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However, studies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team collaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of studies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two SPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer productivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial room for more integrated evaluations. Satisfaction, Performance, and Efficiency are the most frequently investigated dimensions, whereas Communication and Activity remain underexplored. Most studies are exploratory (64%) and methodologically diverse, but lack longitudinal and team-based evaluations. This review surfaces key research gaps and provides recommendations for future research and practice. All artifacts associated with this study are publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/15788502.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed various domains, particularly computer science (CS) education. These models exhibit remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks and problem-solving, raising questions about their potential and limitations in advanced CS contexts. This study presents a novel bilingual (English-Romanian) multimodal (text and image) dataset of multiple-choice questions derived from a high-level computer science competition. A particularity of our dataset is that the problems are conceived such that some of them are easier solved using reasoning on paper, while for others writing code is more efficient. We systematically evaluate State of The Art LLMs on this dataset, analyzing their performance on theoretical programming tasks. Our findings reveal the strengths and limitations of current LLMs, including the influence of language choice (English vs. Romanian), providing insights into their applicability in CS education and competition settings. We also address critical ethical considerations surrounding educational integrity and the fairness of assessments in the context of LLM usage. These discussions aim to inform future educational practices and policies. To support further research, our dataset will be made publicly available in both English and Romanian. Additionally, we release an educational application tailored for Romanian students, enabling them to self-assess using the dataset in an interactive and practice-oriented environment.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Manipulation of Reasoning Models using Internal Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens before their final output, but how this affects their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks remains unclear. While traditional language models make refusal decisions at the prompt-response boundary, we find evidence that DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B makes these decisions within its CoT generation. We identify a linear direction in activation space during CoT token generation that predicts whether the model will refuse or comply -- termed the "caution" direction because it corresponds to cautious reasoning patterns in the generated text. Ablating this direction from model activations increases harmful compliance, effectively jailbreaking the model. We additionally show that intervening only on CoT token activations suffices to control final outputs, and that incorporating this direction into prompt-based attacks improves success rates. Our findings suggest that the chain-of-thought itself is a promising new target for adversarial manipulation in reasoning models.

      <description>arXiv:2507.03175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning has become an essential paradigm in artificial intelligence, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a source task to improve performance on a target task. This approach, particularly through techniques such as pretraining and fine-tuning, has seen significant success in fields like computer vision and natural language processing. However, despite its widespread use, how to reliably assess the transferability of knowledge remains a challenge. Understanding the theoretical underpinnings of each transferability metric is critical for ensuring the success of transfer learning. In this survey, we provide a unified taxonomy of transferability metrics, categorizing them based on transferable knowledge types and measurement granularity. This work examines the various metrics developed to evaluate the potential of source knowledge for transfer learning and their applicability across different learning paradigms emphasizing the need for careful selection of these metrics. By offering insights into how different metrics work under varying conditions, this survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in selecting the most appropriate metric for specific applications, contributing to more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI systems. Finally, we discuss some open challenges in this field and propose future research directions to further advance the application of transferability metrics in trustworthy transfer learning.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Atmospheric Models Reliably Simulate Out-of-Sample Land Heat and Cold Wave Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based general circulation models (GCMs) are emerging as fast simulators, yet their ability to replicate extreme events outside their training range remains unknown. Here, we evaluate two such models -- the hybrid Neural General Circulation Model (NGCM) and purely data-driven Deep Learning Earth System Model (DL\textit{ESy}M) -- against a conventional high-resolution land-atmosphere model (HiRAM) in simulating land heatwaves and coldwaves. All models are forced with observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice over 1900-2020, focusing on the out-of-sample early-20th-century period (1900-1960). Both DL models generalize successfully to unseen climate conditions, broadly reproducing the frequency and spatial patterns of heatwave and cold wave events during 1900-1960 with skill comparable to HiRAM. An exception is over portions of North Asia and North America, where all models perform poorly during 1940-1960. Due to excessive temperature autocorrelation, DL\textit{ESy}M tends to overestimate heatwave and cold wave frequencies, whereas the physics-DL hybrid NGCM exhibits persistence more similar to HiRAM.</description>

      <title>How Much Content Do LLMs Generate That Induces Cognitive Bias in Users?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into applications ranging from review summarization to medical diagnosis support, where they affect human decisions. Even though LLMs perform well in many tasks, they may also inherit societal or cognitive biases, which can inadvertently transfer to humans. We investigate when and how LLMs expose users to biased content and quantify its severity. Specifically, we assess three LLM families in summarization and news fact-checking tasks, evaluating how much LLMs stay consistent with their context and/or hallucinate. Our findings show that LLMs expose users to content that changes the sentiment of the context in 21.86% of the cases, hallucinates on post-knowledge-cutoff data questions in 57.33% of the cases, and primacy bias in 5.94% of the cases. We evaluate 18 distinct mitigation methods across three LLM families and find that targeted interventions can be effective. Given the prevalent use of LLMs in high-stakes domains, such as healthcare or legal analysis, our results highlight the need for robust technical safeguards and for developing user-centered interventions that address LLM limitations.</description>

      <title>AI-driven Web Application for Early Detection of Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS) in Soybean Leaves Using Hyperspectral Images and Genetic Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS), caused by Fusarium virguliforme, poses a significant threat to soybean production. This study presents an AI-driven web application for early detection of SDS on soybean leaves using hyperspectral imaging, enabling diagnosis prior to visible symptom onset. Leaf samples from healthy and inoculated plants were scanned using a portable hyperspectral imaging system (398-1011 nm), and a Genetic Algorithm was employed to select five informative wavelengths (505.4, 563.7, 712.2, 812.9, and 908.4 nm) critical for discriminating infection status. These selected bands were fed into a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract spatial-spectral features, which were subsequently classified using ten classical machine learning models. Ensemble classifiers (Random Forest, AdaBoost), Linear SVM, and Neural Net achieved the highest accuracy (&gt;98%) and minimal error across all folds, as confirmed by confusion matrices and cross-validation metrics. Poor performance by Gaussian Process and QDA highlighted their unsuitability for this dataset. The trained models were deployed within a web application that enables users to upload hyperspectral leaf images, visualize spectral profiles, and receive real-time classification results. This system supports rapid and accessible plant disease diagnostics, contributing to precision agriculture practices. Future work will expand the training dataset to encompass diverse genotypes, field conditions, and disease stages, and will extend the system for multiclass disease classification and broader crop applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey study investigates how digital humanists perceive and approach generative AI disclosure in research. The results indicate that while digital humanities scholars acknowledge the importance of disclosing GenAI use, the actual rate of disclosure in research practice remains low. Respondents differ in their views on which activities most require disclosure and on the most appropriate methods for doing so. Most also believe that safeguards for AI disclosure should be established through institutional policies rather than left to individual decisions. The study's findings will offer empirical guidance to scholars, institutional leaders, funders, and other stakeholders responsible for shaping effective disclosure policies.</description>

      <title>Symbiosis: Multi-Adapter Inference and Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) allows model builders to capture the task specific parameters into adapters, which are a fraction of the size of the original base model. Popularity of PEFT technique for fine-tuning has led to creation of a large number of adapters for popular Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing frameworks fall short in supporting inference or fine-tuning with multiple adapters in the following ways. 1) For fine-tuning, each job needs to deploy its dedicated base model instance, which results in excessive GPU memory consumption and poor GPU utilization. 2) While popular inference platforms can serve multiple PEFT adapters, they do not allow independent resource management or mixing of different PEFT methods. 3) They cannot share resources (such as base model instance) between inference and fine-tuning jobs. 4) They do not provide privacy to users who may not wish to expose their fine-tuned parameters to service providers. In Symbiosis, we address the above problems by enabling as-a-service deployment of base model. The base model layers can be shared across multiple inference or fine-tuning processes. Our split-execution technique decouples the execution of client-specific adapters and layers from the frozen base model layers offering them flexibility to manage their resources, to select their fine-tuning method, to achieve their performance goals. Our approach is transparent to models and works out-of-the-box for most models in the transformers library. Our evaluation on Llama2-13B shows the compared to baseline, Symbiosis can fine-tune 4X more adapters on the same set of GPUs in the same amount of time.</description>

      <title>Neural Inhibition Improves Dynamic Routing and Mixture of Experts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To be effective, efficient, and diverse, deep learning models need to dynamically choose its architecture based on signals from a population of neurons. We hypothesize dynamic routing models can be improved with neural inhibition in those neural populations. This means signals commonly shared among the various modes of data statistics can be inhibited so that the routing model can choose a specialized expert path for each data sample. Only through inhibition is the routing mechanism able to effectively select neural pathways. We believe this is an under-studied and under-verified implementation methodology for Mixture-of-Experts, dynamic routing, and transformer language models. We provide experimental evidence that the neural inhibition algorithm significantly boosts the performance of general tasks and motivates more effort to be invested in this research direction.</description>

      <title>The role of gain neuromodulation in layer-5 pyramidal neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological and artificial learning systems alike confront the plasticity-stability dilemma. In the brain, neuromodulators such as acetylcholine and noradrenaline relieve this tension by tuning neuronal gain and inhibitory gating, balancing segregation and integration of circuits. Fed by dense cholinergic and noradrenergic projections from the ascending arousal system, layer-5 pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex offer a relevant substrate for understanding these dynamics. When distal dendritic signals coincide with back-propagating action potentials, calcium plateaus turn a single somatic spike into a high-gain burst, and interneuron inhibition sculpts the output. These properties make layer-5 cells gain-tunable amplifiers that translate neuromodulatory cues into flexible cortical activity. To capture this mechanism we developed a two-compartment Izhikevich model for pyramidal neurons and single-compartment somatostatin (SOM) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, linked by Gaussian connectivity and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The soma and apical dendrite are so coupled that somatic spikes back-propagate, while dendritic plateaus can switch the soma from regular firing to bursting by shifting reset and adaptation variables. We show that stronger dendritic drive or tighter coupling raise gain by increasing the likelihood of calcium-triggered somatic bursts. In contrast, dendritic-targeted inhibition suppresses gain, while somatic-targeted inhibition raises the firing threshold of neighboring neurons, thus gating neurons output. Notably, bursting accelerates STDP, supporting rapid synaptic reconfiguration and flexibility.This suggests that brief gain pulses driven by neuromodulators could serve as an adaptive two-timescale optimization mechanism, effectively modulating the synaptic weight updates.</description>

      <title>On Jailbreaking Quantized Language Models Through Fault Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The safety alignment of Language Models (LMs) is a critical concern, yet their integrity can be challenged by direct parameter manipulation attacks, such as those potentially induced by fault injection. As LMs are increasingly deployed using low-precision quantization for efficiency, this paper investigates the efficacy of such attacks for jailbreaking aligned LMs across different quantization schemes. We propose gradient-guided attacks, including a tailored progressive bit-level search algorithm introduced herein and a comparative word-level (single weight update) attack. Our evaluation on Llama-3.2-3B, Phi-4-mini, and Llama-3-8B across FP16 (baseline), and weight-only quantization (FP8, INT8, INT4) reveals that quantization significantly influences attack success. While attacks readily achieve high success (&gt;80\% Attack Success Rate, ASR) on FP16 models, within an attack budget of 25 perturbations, FP8 and INT8 models exhibit ASRs below 20\% and 50\%, respectively. Increasing the perturbation budget up to 150 bit-flips, FP8 models maintained ASR below 65\%, demonstrating some resilience compared to INT8 and INT4 models that have high ASR. In addition, analysis of perturbation locations revealed differing architectural targets across quantization schemes, with (FP16, INT4) and (INT8, FP8) showing similar characteristics. Besides, jailbreaks induced in FP16 models were highly transferable to subsequent FP8/INT8 quantization (&lt;5\% ASR difference), though INT4 significantly reduced transferred ASR (avg. 35\% drop). These findings highlight that while common quantization schemes, particularly FP8, increase the difficulty of direct parameter manipulation jailbreaks, vulnerabilities can still persist, especially through post-attack quantization.</description>

      <title>Toward Efficient Speech Emotion Recognition via Spectral Learning and Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) traditionally relies on auditory data analysis for emotion classification. Several studies have adopted different methods for SER. However, existing SER methods often struggle to capture subtle emotional variations and generalize across diverse datasets. In this article, we use Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as spectral features to bridge the gap between computational emotion processing and human auditory perception. To further improve robustness and feature diversity, we propose a novel 1D-CNN-based SER framework that integrates data augmentation techniques. MFCC features extracted from the augmented data are processed using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture enhanced with channel and spatial attention mechanisms. These attention modules allow the model to highlight key emotional patterns, enhancing its ability to capture subtle variations in speech signals. The proposed method delivers cutting-edge performance, achieving the accuracy of 97.49% for SAVEE, 99.23% for RAVDESS, 89.31% for CREMA-D, 99.82% for TESS, 99.53% for EMO-DB, and 96.39% for EMOVO. Experimental results show new benchmarks in SER, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in recognizing emotional expressions with high precision. Our evaluation demonstrates that the integration of advanced Deep Learning (DL) methods substantially enhances generalization across diverse datasets, underscoring their potential to advance SER for real-world deployment in assistive technologies and human-computer interaction.</description>

      <title>RefineX: Learning to Refine Pre-training Data at Scale from Expert-Guided Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The foundational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are deeply influenced by the quality of their pre-training corpora. However, enhancing data quality at scale remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the trade-off between refinement effectiveness and processing efficiency. While rule-based filtering remains the dominant paradigm, it typically operates at the document level and lacks the granularity needed to refine specific content within documents. Inspired by emerging work such as ProX, we propose $\textbf{RefineX}$, a novel framework for large-scale, surgical refinement of pre-training data through programmatic editing tasks. RefineX enables efficient and fine-grained data refinement while reliably preserving the diversity and naturalness of raw text. The core strength of RefineX lies in distilling high-quality, expert-guided end-to-end refinement results into minimal edit-based deletion programs. This high-precision distillation pipeline is used to train an efficient and reliable refine model that can systematically improve every instance in the corpus at scale. We evaluate RefineX across from-scratch pre-training at multiple model scales and find that it consistently outperforms models trained on raw, filtered, or alternatively refined data across diverse downstream tasks. On the 750M model, RefineX yields 2.6%-7.2% average gains on lighteval tasks, and achieves comparable performance using significantly fewer training tokens. Further analysis shows that RefineX reliably enhances text quality with both high efficiency and precision, outperforming prior approaches such as end-to-end generation and Prox-C. These results position RefineX as a scalable, effective, and reliable solution for optimizing pre-training data in modern LLM pipelines.</description>

      <title>Investigating Redundancy in Multimodal Large Language Models with Multiple Vision Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly adopt multiple vision encoders to capture diverse visual information, ranging from coarse semantics to fine grained details. While this approach is intended to enhance visual understanding capability, we observe that the performance gains from adding encoders often diminish and can even lead to performance degradation, a phenomenon we term encoder redundancy. This paper presents a systematic investigation into this issue. Through comprehensive ablation studies on state of the art multi encoder MLLMs, we empirically demonstrate that significant redundancy exists. To quantify each encoder's unique contribution, we propose a principled metric: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR). Building on CUR, we introduce the Information Gap (IG) to capture the overall disparity in encoder utility within a model.Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders contribute little, or even negatively, to overall performance, confirming substantial redundancy. Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders contribute minimally, or even negatively, to the model's performance, confirming the prevalence of redundancy. These findings highlight critical inefficiencies in current multi encoder designs and establish that our proposed metrics can serve as valuable diagnostic tools for developing more efficient and effective multimodal architectures.</description>

      <title>Conformal Information Pursuit for Interactively Guiding Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with 20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering greater interpretability.</description>

      <title>MGAA: Multi-Granular Adaptive Allocation fof Low-Rank Compression of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enormous parameter scale of large language models (LLMs) has made model compression a research hotspot, which aims to alleviate computational resource demands during deployment and inference. As a promising direction, low-rank approximation technique has made remarkable achievements. Nevertheless, unfortunately, the vast majority of studies to low-rank approximation compression generally apply uniform compression ratios across all weight matrices, while disregarding their inherently differentiated impacts on the model's performance. Although a few recent work attempts to employ heuristic search strategies to achieve the optimal parameter allocation, such strategies are computationally inefficient and lose the generalization ability in the era of LLMs. In this study, we propose a novel parameter Multi-Granular Adaptive Allocation (MGAA) method, which can adaptively allocate parameters between and within sublayers without task-specific evaluations in the compression process. MGAA consists of two components: 1) Among different sublayers, it assigns compression ratios based on their cosine similarity between inputs and outputs, allowing for a more tailored compression in sublayers with varying degrees of importance, and 2) Within each sublayer, it allocates different compression ratios to weight matrices based on their energy distribution characteristics, ensuring a consistent energy retention ratio while optimizing compression efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations of MGAA across multiple LLMs backbone models and benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior performance. Additionally, we apply our MGAA to multimodal model LLaVA, exhibiting remarkable performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Out-of-Distribution Unlabeled Images: Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with an Open-Vocabulary Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, existing studies have shown promising results in academic settings with controlled splits of benchmark datasets. However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger sets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant unlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images) or large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions from those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution (OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can lead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework with an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize unlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets demonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves the performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and (2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD images leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS outperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU, respectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art performance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes abundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks. We hope this work can inspire future research and real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/wooseok-shin/SemiOVS</description>

      <title>Scaffolding Recursive Divergence and Convergence in Story Ideation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human creative ideation involves both exploration of diverse ideas (divergence) and selective synthesis of explored ideas into coherent combinations (convergence). While processes of divergence and convergence are often interleaved and nested, existing AI-powered creativity support tools (CSTs) lack support for sophisticated orchestration of divergence and convergence. We present Reverger, an AI-powered CST that helps users ideate variations of conceptual directions for modifying a story by scaffolding flexible iteration between divergence and convergence. For divergence, our tool enables recursive exploration of alternative high-level directions for modifying a specific part of the original story. For convergence, it allows users to collect explored high-level directions and synthesize them into concrete variations. Users can then iterate between divergence and convergence until they find a satisfactory outcome. A within-subject study revealed that Reverger permitted participants to explore more unexpected and diverse high-level directions than a comparable baseline. Reverger users also felt that they had more fine-grained control and discovered more effort-worthy outcomes.</description>

      <title>ReTimeCausal: EM-Augmented Additive Noise Models for Interpretable Causal Discovery in Irregular Time Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies causal discovery in irregularly sampled time series-a pivotal challenge in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and climate science, where missing data and inconsistent sampling frequencies distort causal mechanisms. Traditional methods (e.g., Granger causality, PCMCI) fail to reconcile multi-scale interactions (e.g., hourly storms vs. decadal climate shifts), while neural approaches (e.g., CUTS+) lack interpretability, stemming from a critical gap: existing frameworks either rigidly assume temporal regularity or aggregate dynamics into opaque representations, neglecting real-world granularity and auditable logic. To bridge this gap, we propose ReTimeCausal, a novel integration of Additive Noise Models (ANM) and Expectation-Maximization (EM) that unifies physics-guided data imputation with sparse causal inference. Through kernelized sparse regression and structural constraints, ReTimeCausal iteratively refines missing values (E-step) and causal graphs (M-step), resolving cross-frequency dependencies and missing data issues. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ReTimeCausal outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under challenging irregular sampling and missing data conditions.</description>

      <title>GRAFT: A Graph-based Flow-aware Agentic Framework for Document-level Machine Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Document level Machine Translation (DocMT) approaches often struggle with effectively capturing discourse level phenomena. Existing approaches rely on heuristic rules to segment documents into discourse units, which rarely align with the true discourse structure required for accurate translation. Otherwise, they fail to maintain consistency throughout the document during translation. To address these challenges, we propose Graph Augmented Agentic Framework for Document Level Translation (GRAFT), a novel graph based DocMT system that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents for document translation. Our approach integrates segmentation, directed acyclic graph (DAG) based dependency modelling, and discourse aware translation into a cohesive framework. Experiments conducted across eight translation directions and six diverse domains demonstrate that GRAFT achieves significant performance gains over state of the art DocMT systems. Specifically, GRAFT delivers an average improvement of 2.8 d BLEU on the TED test sets from IWSLT2017 over strong baselines and 2.3 d BLEU for domain specific translation from English to Chinese. Moreover, our analyses highlight the consistent ability of GRAFT to address discourse level phenomena, yielding coherent and contextually accurate translations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Translating nuanced, textually-defined authorial writing styles into compelling visual representations presents a novel challenge in generative AI. This paper introduces a pipeline that leverages Author Writing Sheets (AWS) - structured summaries of an author's literary characteristics - as input to a Large Language Model (LLM, Claude 3.7 Sonnet). The LLM interprets the AWS to generate three distinct, descriptive text-to-image prompts, which are then rendered by a diffusion model (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium). We evaluated our approach using 49 author styles from Reddit data, with human evaluators assessing the stylistic match and visual distinctiveness of the generated images. Results indicate a good perceived alignment between the generated visuals and the textual authorial profiles (mean style match: $4.08/5$), with images rated as moderately distinctive. Qualitative analysis further highlighted the pipeline's ability to capture mood and atmosphere, while also identifying challenges in representing highly abstract narrative elements. This work contributes a novel end-to-end methodology for visual authorial style personalization and provides an initial empirical validation, opening avenues for applications in creative assistance and cross-modal understanding.</description>

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches have been increasingly applied in drug discovery to learn molecular representations and identify substructures driving property predictions. However, building end-to-end explainable machine learning models for structure-activity relationship (SAR) modeling for compound property prediction faces many challenges, such as limited activity data per target and the sensitivity of properties to subtle molecular changes. To address this, we leveraged activity-cliff molecule pairs, i.e., compounds sharing a common scaffold but differing sharply in potency, targeting three proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src proteins (i.e., PDB IDs 1O42, 2H8H, and 4MXO). We implemented graph neural network (GNN) methods to obtain atom-level feature information and predict compound-protein affinity (i.e., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50). In addition, we trained GNN models with different structure-aware loss functions to adequately leverage molecular property and structure information. We also utilized group lasso and sparse group lasso to prune and highlight molecular subgraphs and enhance the structure-specific model explainability for the predicted property difference in molecular activity-cliff pairs. We improved drug property prediction by integrating common and uncommon node information and using sparse group lasso, reducing the average root mean squared error (RMSE) by 12.70%, and achieving the lowest averaged RMSE=0.2551 and the highest PCC=0.9572. Furthermore, applying regularization enhances feature attribution methods that estimate the contribution of each atom in the molecular graphs by boosting global direction scores and atom-level accuracy in atom coloring accuracy, which improves model interpretability in drug discovery pipelines, particularly in investigating important molecular substructures in lead optimization.</description>

      <title>Source-Free Domain Adaptation via Multi-view Contrastive Learning</title>

Abstract: Domain adaptation has become a widely adopted approach in machine learning due to the high costs associated with labeling data. It is typically applied when access to a labeled source domain is available. However, in real-world scenarios, privacy concerns often restrict access to sensitive information, such as fingerprints, bank account details, and facial images. A promising solution to this issue is Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA), which enables domain adaptation without requiring access to labeled target domain data. Recent research demonstrates that SFUDA can effectively address domain discrepancies; however, two key challenges remain: (1) the low quality of prototype samples, and (2) the incorrect assignment of pseudo-labels. To tackle these challenges, we propose a method consisting of three main phases. In the first phase, we introduce a Reliable Sample Memory (RSM) module to improve the quality of prototypes by selecting more representative samples. In the second phase, we employ a Multi-View Contrastive Learning (MVCL) approach to enhance pseudo-label quality by leveraging multiple data augmentations. In the final phase, we apply a noisy label filtering technique to further refine the pseudo-labels. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets - VisDA 2017, Office-Home, and Office-31 - demonstrate that our method achieves approximately 2 percent and 6 percent improvements in classification accuracy over the second-best method and the average of 13 well-known state-of-the-art approaches, respectively.</description>

      <title>Read Quietly, Think Aloud: Decoupling Comprehension and Reasoning in LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding text and generating high-quality responses. However, a critical distinction from human cognition is their typical lack of a distinct internal `reading' or deliberation phase before `speaking' (i.e., generating text). Humans often engage in silent reading to comprehend context and formulate thoughts prior to articulation. This paper investigates methods to imbue LLMs with a similar capacity for internal processing.
  We introduce and evaluate techniques that encourage LLMs to `read silently.' Our findings indicate that even a straightforward approach, such as providing the model with an initial contextual prompt or `reading space' before it begins predicting subsequent tokens for the final output, can yield significant performance improvements. We further enhance this concept by developing a `reading buddy' architecture, where an auxiliary component silently processes the input and provides refined contextual insights to the primary generation model. These approaches aim to foster deeper understanding from LLMs so that they can produce better reasoned responses, moving them one step closer to more human-like text processing. Our results indicate that these simple techniques can provide surprisingly strong impact on accuracy with multiple point accuracy boost.</description>

      <title>Task-Specific Generative Dataset Distillation with Difficulty-Guided Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets, dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field. However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance on other downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>De-Fake: Style based Anomaly Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting deepfakes involving face-swaps presents a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where anyone can perform face-swapping with freely available tools and apps without any technical knowledge. Existing deepfake detection methods rely on facial landmarks or inconsistencies in pixel-level features and often struggle with face-swap deepfakes, where the source face is seamlessly blended into the target image or video. The prevalence of face-swap is evident in everyday life, where it is used to spread false information, damage reputations, manipulate political opinions, create non-consensual intimate deepfakes (NCID), and exploit children by enabling the creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Even prominent public figures are not immune to its impact, with numerous deepfakes of them circulating widely across social media platforms. Another challenge faced by deepfake detection methods is the creation of datasets that encompass a wide range of variations, as training models require substantial amounts of data. This raises privacy concerns, particularly regarding the processing and storage of personal facial data, which could lead to unauthorized access or misuse. Our key idea is to identify these style discrepancies to detect face-swapped images effectively without accessing the real facial image. We perform comprehensive evaluations using multiple datasets and face-swapping methods, which showcases the effectiveness of SafeVision in detecting face-swap deepfakes across diverse scenarios. SafeVision offers a reliable and scalable solution for detecting face-swaps in a privacy preserving manner, making it particularly effective in challenging real-world applications. To the best of our knowledge, SafeVision is the first deepfake detection using style features while providing inherent privacy protection.</description>

      <title>DESign: Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution and Efficient Subnet Regularization for Continuous Sign Language Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) methods struggle with handling diverse samples. Although dynamic convolutions are ideal for this task, they mainly focus on spatial modeling and fail to capture the temporal dynamics and contextual dependencies. To address this, we propose DESign, a novel framework that incorporates Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution (DCAC) and Subnet Regularization Connectionist Temporal Classification (SR-CTC). DCAC dynamically captures the inter-frame motion cues that constitute signs and uniquely adapts convolutional weights in a fine-grained manner based on contextual information, enabling the model to better generalize across diverse signing behaviors and boost recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that existing methods still rely on only a limited number of frames for parameter updates during training, indicating that CTC learning overfits to a dominant path. To address this, SR-CTC regularizes training by applying supervision to subnetworks, encouraging the model to explore diverse CTC alignment paths and effectively preventing overfitting. A classifier-sharing strategy in SR-CTC further strengthens multi-scale consistency. Notably, SR-CTC introduces no inference overhead and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CSLR models to boost performance. Extensive ablations and visualizations further validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Results on mainstream CSLR datasets (i.e., PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily) demonstrate that DESign achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sentiment analysis, widely used in product reviews, also impacts financial markets by influencing asset prices through microblogs and news articles. Despite research in sentiment-driven finance, many studies focus on sentence-level classification, overlooking its practical application in trading. This study bridges that gap by evaluating sentiment-based trading strategies for generating positive alpha. We conduct a backtesting analysis using sentiment predictions from three models (two classification and one regression) applied to news articles on Dow Jones 30 stocks, comparing them to the benchmark Buy&amp;Hold strategy. Results show all models produced positive returns, with the regression model achieving the highest return of 50.63% over 28 months, outperforming the benchmark Buy&amp;Hold strategy. This highlights the potential of sentiment in enhancing investment strategies and financial decision-making.</description>

      <title>Be the Change You Want to See: Revisiting Remote Sensing Change Detection Practices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing change detection aims to localize semantic changes between images of the same location captured at different times. In the past few years, newer methods have attributed enhanced performance to the additions of new and complex components to existing architectures. Most fail to measure the performance contribution of fundamental design choices such as backbone selection, pre-training strategies, and training configurations. We claim that such fundamental design choices often improve performance even more significantly than the addition of new architectural components. Due to that, we systematically revisit the design space of change detection models and analyse the full potential of a well-optimised baseline. We identify a set of fundamental design choices that benefit both new and existing architectures. Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that when carefully designed, even an architecturally simple model can match or surpass state-of-the-art performance on six challenging change detection datasets. Our best practices generalise beyond our architecture and also offer performance improvements when applied to related methods, indicating that the space of fundamental design choices has been underexplored. Our guidelines and architecture provide a strong foundation for future methods, emphasizing that optimizing core components is just as important as architectural novelty in advancing change detection performance.

      <title>LLM4Hint: Leveraging Large Language Models for Hint Recommendation in Offline Query Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Query optimization is essential for efficient SQL query execution in DBMS, and remains attractive over time due to the growth of data volumes and advances in hardware. Existing traditional optimizers struggle with the cumbersome hand-tuning required for complex workloads, and the learning-based methods face limitations in ensuring generalization. With the great success of Large Language Model (LLM) across diverse downstream tasks, this paper explores how LLMs can be incorporated to enhance the generalization of learned optimizers. Though promising, such an incorporation still presents challenges, mainly including high model inference latency, and the substantial fine-tuning cost and suboptimal performance due to inherent discrepancy between the token sequences in LLM and structured SQL execution plans with rich numerical features.
  In this paper, we focus on recurring queries in offline optimization to alleviate the issue of high inference latency, and propose \textbf{LLM4Hint} that leverages moderate-sized backbone LLMs to recommend query optimization hints. LLM4Hint achieves the goals through: (i) integrating a lightweight model to produce a soft prompt, which captures the data distribution in DBMS and the SQL predicates to provide sufficient optimization features while simultaneously reducing the context length fed to the LLM, (ii) devising a query rewriting strategy using a larger commercial LLM, so as to simplify SQL semantics for the backbone LLM and reduce fine-tuning costs, and (iii) introducing an explicit matching prompt to facilitate alignment between the LLM and the lightweight model, which can accelerate convergence of the combined model. Experiments show that LLM4Hint, by leveraging the LLM's stronger capability to understand the query statement, can outperform the state-of-the-art learned optimizers in terms of both effectiveness and generalization.</description>

      <title>Pose-Star: Anatomy-Aware Editing for Open-World Fashion Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To advance real-world fashion image editing, we analyze existing two-stage pipelines(mask generation followed by diffusion-based editing)which overly prioritize generator optimization while neglecting mask controllability. This results in two critical limitations: I) poor user-defined flexibility (coarse-grained human masks restrict edits to predefined regions like upper torso; fine-grained clothes masks preserve poses but forbid style/length customization). II) weak pose robustness (mask generators fail due to articulated poses and miss rare regions like waist, while human parsers remain limited by predefined categories). To address these gaps, we propose Pose-Star, a framework that dynamically recomposes body structures (e.g., neck, chest, etc.) into anatomy-aware masks (e.g., chest-length) for user-defined edits. In Pose-Star, we calibrate diffusion-derived attention (Star tokens) via skeletal keypoints to enhance rare structure localization in complex poses, suppress noise through phase-aware analysis of attention dynamics (Convergence,Stabilization,Divergence) with threshold masking and sliding-window fusion, and refine edges via cross-self attention merging and Canny alignment. This work bridges controlled benchmarks and open-world demands, pioneering anatomy-aware, pose-robust editing and laying the foundation for industrial fashion image editing.</description>

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is essential in drug discovery and related fields. However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle to simultaneously capture both local and global molecular structures. In this work, we propose a Multi-Level Fusion Graph Neural Network (MLFGNN) that integrates Graph Attention Networks and a novel Graph Transformer to jointly model local and global dependencies. In addition, we incorporate molecular fingerprints as a complementary modality and introduce a mechanism of interaction between attention to adaptively fuse information across representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that MLFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both classification and regression tasks. Interpretability analysis further reveals that the model effectively captures task-relevant chemical patterns, supporting the usefulness of multi-level and multi-modal fusion in molecular representation learning.</description>

      <title>Improving Social Determinants of Health Documentation in French EHRs Using Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDoH) significantly influence health outcomes, shaping disease progression, treatment adherence, and health disparities. However, their documentation in structured electronic health records (EHRs) is often incomplete or missing. This study presents an approach based on large language models (LLMs) for extracting 13 SDoH categories from French clinical notes. We trained Flan-T5-Large on annotated social history sections from clinical notes at Nantes University Hospital, France. We evaluated the model at two levels: (i) identification of SDoH categories and associated values, and (ii) extraction of detailed SDoH with associated temporal and quantitative information. The model performance was assessed across four datasets, including two that we publicly release as open resources. The model achieved strong performance for identifying well-documented categories such as living condition, marital status, descendants, job, tobacco, and alcohol use (F1 score &gt; 0.80). Performance was lower for categories with limited training data or highly variable expressions, such as employment status, housing, physical activity, income, and education. Our model identified 95.8% of patients with at least one SDoH, compared to 2.8% for ICD-10 codes from structured EHR data. Our error analysis showed that performance limitations were linked to annotation inconsistencies, reliance on English-centric tokenizer, and reduced generalizability due to the model being trained on social history sections only. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of NLP in improving the completeness of real-world SDoH data in a non-English EHR system.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Evaluators: Trust in Adversarial Robustness Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in designing powerful adversarial evasion attacks for robustness verification, the evaluation of these methods often remains inconsistent and unreliable. Many assessments rely on mismatched models, unverified implementations, and uneven computational budgets, which can lead to biased results and a false sense of security. Consequently, robustness claims built on such flawed testing protocols may be misleading and give a false sense of security. As a concrete step toward improving evaluation reliability, we present AttackBench, a benchmark framework developed to assess the effectiveness of gradient-based attacks under standardized and reproducible conditions. AttackBench serves as an evaluation tool that ranks existing attack implementations based on a novel optimality metric, which enables researchers and practitioners to identify the most reliable and effective attack for use in subsequent robustness evaluations. The framework enforces consistent testing conditions and enables continuous updates, making it a reliable foundation for robustness verification.</description>

      <title>Helping CLIP See Both the Forest and the Trees: A Decomposition and Description Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP achieve cross-modal semantic alignment through contrastive learning, exhibiting robust zero-shot generalization. Traditional prompt engineering, however, predominantly relies on coarse-grained category labels, neglecting fine-grained local semantics. Existing approaches assume that VLMs inherently recognize localized visual details and attempt to enhance classification by augmenting text prompts with attribute descriptors generated by large language models. However, our systematic experiments reveal critical limitations: CLIP's strong bias toward global image patterns hinders its ability to process localized visual descriptors. To address this fundamental constraint, we propose a simple, effective, and plug-and-play solution that enables CLIP to ``See Both the Forest and the Trees." Specifically, we employ stochastic multi-crop augmentation to activate CLIP's latent capacity for localized feature analysis. By cropping only partial regions, the approach effectively constrains the model's receptive field and recalibrates its attention mechanism, thereby mitigating its inherent bias. We evaluate the proposed method under zero-shot, few-shot, and test-time adaptation settings, and extensive experiments demonstrate that D&amp;D achieves promising performance.</description>

      <title>Beyond Weaponization: NLP Security for Medium and Lower-Resourced Languages in Their Own Right</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite mounting evidence that multilinguality can be easily weaponized against language models (LMs), works across NLP Security remain overwhelmingly English-centric. In terms of securing LMs, the NLP norm of "English first" collides with standard procedure in cybersecurity, whereby practitioners are expected to anticipate and prepare for worst-case outcomes. To mitigate worst-case outcomes in NLP Security, researchers must be willing to engage with the weakest links in LM security: lower-resourced languages. Accordingly, this work examines the security of LMs for lower- and medium-resourced languages. We extend existing adversarial attacks for up to 70 languages to evaluate the security of monolingual and multilingual LMs for these languages. Through our analysis, we find that monolingual models are often too small in total number of parameters to ensure sound security, and that while multilinguality is helpful, it does not always guarantee improved security either. Ultimately, these findings highlight important considerations for more secure deployment of LMs, for communities of lower-resourced languages.</description>

      <title>BMMR: A Large-Scale Bilingual Multimodal Multi-Discipline Reasoning Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03483v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce BMMR, a large-scale bilingual, multimodal, multi-disciplinary reasoning dataset for the community to develop and evaluate large multimodal models (LMMs). BMMR comprises 110k college-level questions spanning 300 UNESCO-defined subjects, spanning diverse formats-multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and open-ended QA-and sourced from both print and digital media such as books, exams, and quizzes. All data are curated and filtered via a human-in-the-loop and scalable framework, and each instance is paired with a high-quality reasoning path. The dataset is organized into two parts: BMMR-Eval that comprises 20,458 high-quality instances to comprehensively assess LMMs' knowledge and reasoning across multiple disciplines in both Chinese and English; and BMMR-Train that contains 88,991 instances to support further research and development, extending the current focus on mathematical reasoning to diverse disciplines and domains. In addition, we propose the process-based multi-discipline verifier (i.e., BMMR-Verifier) for accurate and fine-grained evaluation of reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on 24 models reveal that (i) even SOTA models (e.g., o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro) leave substantial headroom on BMMR-Eval; (ii) reasoning models exhibit discipline bias and outperform LMMs only on specific subjects; (iii) open-source models still trail their proprietary counterparts; and (iv) fine-tuning on BMMR-Train narrows this gap. Additionally, we conduct reasoning-chain analyses using BMMR-Verifier and other in-depth studies, uncovering the challenges LMMs currently face in multidisciplinary reasoning. We will release the data, and we hope our work can offer insights and contributions to the community.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-based Feature Generation Algorithm for Scientific Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature generation (FG) aims to enhance the prediction potential of original data by constructing high-order feature combinations and removing redundant features. It is a key preprocessing step for tabular scientific data to improve downstream machine-learning model performance. Traditional methods face the following two challenges when dealing with the feature generation of scientific data: First, the effective construction of high-order feature combinations in scientific data necessitates profound and extensive domain-specific expertise. Secondly, as the order of feature combinations increases, the search space expands exponentially, imposing prohibitive human labor consumption. Advancements in the Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) paradigm have opened novel avenues for automating feature generation processes. Inspired by that, this paper revisits the conventional feature generation workflow and proposes the Multi-agent Feature Generation (MAFG) framework. Specifically, in the iterative exploration stage, multi-agents will construct mathematical transformation equations collaboratively, synthesize and identify feature combinations ex-hibiting high information content, and leverage a reinforcement learning mechanism to evolve their strategies. Upon completing the exploration phase, MAFG integrates the large language models (LLMs) to interpreta-tively evaluate the generated features of each significant model performance breakthrough. Experimental results and case studies consistently demonstrate that the MAFG framework effectively automates the feature generation process and significantly enhances various downstream scientific data mining tasks.</description>

      <title>Generating Synthetic Relational Tabular Data via Structural Causal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation has received increasing attention in recent years, particularly with the emergence of foundation models for tabular data. The breakthrough success of TabPFN (Hollmann et al.,2025), which leverages vast quantities of synthetic tabular datasets derived from structural causal models (SCMs), demonstrates the critical role synthetic data plays in developing powerful tabular foundation models. However, most real-world tabular data exists in relational formats spanning multiple interconnected tables - a structure not adequately addressed by current generation methods. In this work, we extend the SCM-based approach by developing a novel framework that generates realistic synthetic relational tabular data including causal relationships across tables. Our experiments confirm that this framework is able to construct relational datasets with complex inter-table dependencies mimicking real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Alignment with Cross-Attentive GRUs for Fine-Grained Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-grained video classification requires understanding complex spatio-temporal and semantic cues that often exceed the capacity of a single modality. In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework that fuses video, image, and text representations using GRU-based sequence encoders and cross-modal attention mechanisms. The model is trained using a combination of classification or regression loss, depending on the task, and is further regularized through feature-level augmentation and autoencoding techniques. To evaluate the generality of our framework, we conduct experiments on two challenging benchmarks: the DVD dataset for real-world violence detection and the Aff-Wild2 dataset for valence-arousal estimation. Our results demonstrate that the proposed fusion strategy significantly outperforms unimodal baselines, with cross-attention and feature augmentation contributing notably to robustness and performance.</description>

      <title>Foundation versus Domain-specific Models: Performance Comparison, Fusion, and Explainability in Face Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the following question: How do generic foundation models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP, LLaVa, DINO) compare against a domain-specific face recognition model (viz., AdaFace or ArcFace) on the face recognition task? Through a series of experiments involving several foundation models and benchmark datasets, we are able to report the following findings: (a) In all datasets considered, domain-specific models outperformed zero-shot foundation models. (b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on over-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the importance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of 0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on the LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the TMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%. (c) A simple score-level fusion of a foundation model with a domain-specific FR model improved the accuracy at low FMRs. For example, the TMR of AdaFace when fused with BLIP improved from 72.64% to 83.31% at an FMR of 0.0001% on the IJB-B dataset and from 73.17% to 85.81% on the IJB-C dataset. (d) Foundation models, such as ChatGPT, can be used to impart explainability to the FR pipeline (e.g., ``Despite minor lighting and head tilt differences, the two left-profile images show high consistency in forehead slope, nose shape, chin contour...''). In some instances, foundation models are even able to resolve low-confidence decisions made by AdaFace (e.g., ``Although AdaFace assigns a low similarity score of 0.21, both images exhibit visual similarity...and the pair is likely of the same person''), thereby reiterating the importance of combining domain-specific FR models with generic foundation models in a judicious manner.</description>

      <title>H2HTalk: Evaluating Large Language Models as Emotional Companion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As digital emotional support needs grow, Large Language Model companions offer promising authentic, always-available empathy, though rigorous evaluation lags behind model advancement. We present Heart-to-Heart Talk (H2HTalk), a benchmark assessing companions across personality development and empathetic interaction, balancing emotional intelligence with linguistic fluency. H2HTalk features 4,650 curated scenarios spanning dialogue, recollection, and itinerary planning that mirror real-world support conversations, substantially exceeding previous datasets in scale and diversity. We incorporate a Secure Attachment Persona (SAP) module implementing attachment-theory principles for safer interactions. Benchmarking 50 LLMs with our unified protocol reveals that long-horizon planning and memory retention remain key challenges, with models struggling when user needs are implicit or evolve mid-conversation. H2HTalk establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for emotionally intelligent companions. We release all materials to advance development of LLMs capable of providing meaningful and safe psychological support.</description>

      <title>An Advanced Deep Learning Framework for Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Brain Stroke Diagnosis Using Computed Tomography (CT) Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and long-term disability worldwide, highlighting the need for precise and fast prediction techniques. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is considered one of the most effective methods for diagnosing brain strokes. The majority of stroke classification techniques rely on a single slice-level prediction mechanism, allowing the radiologist to manually choose the most critical CT slice from the original CT volume. Although clinical evaluations are often used in traditional diagnostic procedures, machine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for improving stroke diagnosis. To supplement traditional diagnostic techniques, this study investigates the use of machine learning models, specifically concerning the prediction of brain stroke at an early stage utilizing CT scan images. In this research, we proposed a novel approach to brain stroke detection leveraging machine learning techniques, focusing on optimizing classification performance with pre-trained deep learning models and advanced optimization strategies. Pre-trained models, including DenseNet201, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception, are utilized for feature extraction. Additionally, we employed feature engineering techniques, including BFO, PCA, and LDA, to enhance models' performance further. These features are subsequently classified using machine learning algorithms such as SVC, RF, XGB, DT, LR, KNN, and GNB. Our experiments demonstrate that the combination of MobileNetV2, LDA, and SVC achieved the highest classification accuracy of 97.93%, significantly outperforming other model-optimizer-classifier combinations. The results underline the effectiveness of integrating lightweight pre-trained models with robust optimization and classification techniques for brain stroke diagnosis.</description>

      <title>SciVid: Cross-Domain Evaluation of Video Models in Scientific Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a proliferation of spatiotemporal foundation models in different scientific disciplines. While promising, these models are often domain-specific and are only assessed within the particular applications for which they are designed. Given that many tasks can be represented as video modeling problems, video foundation models (ViFMs) hold considerable promise as general-purpose domain-agnostic approaches. However, it is not known whether the knowledge acquired on large-scale but potentially out-of-domain data can be effectively transferred across diverse scientific disciplines, and if a single, pretrained ViFM can be competitive with domain-specific baselines. To address this, we introduce SciVid, a comprehensive benchmark comprising five *Sci*entific *Vid*eo tasks, across medical computer vision, animal behavior, and weather forecasting. We adapt six leading ViFMs to SciVid using simple trainable readout modules, establishing strong baselines and demonstrating the potential for effective transfer learning. Specifically, we show that state-of-the-art results can be obtained in several applications by leveraging the general-purpose representations from ViFM backbones. Furthermore, our results reveal the limitations of existing ViFMs, and highlight opportunities for the development of generalizable models for high-impact scientific applications. We release our code at https://github.com/google-deepmind/scivid to facilitate further research in the development of ViFMs.</description>

      <title>Causal-SAM-LLM: Large Language Models as Causal Reasoners for Robust Medical Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The clinical utility of deep learning models for medical image segmentation is severely constrained by their inability to generalize to unseen domains. This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder, incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9% of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems.</description>

      <title>RECA-PD: A Robust Explainable Cross-Attention Method for Speech-based Parkinson's Disease Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) affects over 10 million people globally, with speech impairments often preceding motor symptoms by years, making speech a valuable modality for early, non-invasive detection. While recent deep-learning models achieve high accuracy, they typically lack the explainability required for clinical use. To address this, we propose RECA-PD, a novel, robust, and explainable cross-attention architecture that combines interpretable speech features with self-supervised representations. RECA-PD matches state-of-the-art performance in Speech-based PD detection while providing explanations that are more consistent and more clinically meaningful. Additionally, we demonstrate that performance degradation in certain speech tasks (e.g., monologue) can be mitigated by segmenting long recordings. Our findings indicate that performance and explainability are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Future work will enhance the usability of explanations for non-experts and explore severity estimation to increase the real-world clinical relevance.</description>

      <title>MusGO: A Community-Driven Framework For Assessing Openness in Music-Generative AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since 2023, generative AI has rapidly advanced in the music domain. Despite significant technological advancements, music-generative models raise critical ethical challenges, including a lack of transparency and accountability, along with risks such as the replication of artists' works, which highlights the importance of fostering openness. With upcoming regulations such as the EU AI Act encouraging open models, many generative models are being released labelled as 'open'. However, the definition of an open model remains widely debated. In this article, we adapt a recently proposed evidence-based framework for assessing openness in LLMs to the music domain. Using feedback from a survey of 110 participants from the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) community, we refine the framework into MusGO (Music-Generative Open AI), which comprises 13 openness categories: 8 essential and 5 desirable. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art generative models and provide an openness leaderboard that is fully open to public scrutiny and community contributions. Through this work, we aim to clarify the concept of openness in music-generative AI and promote its transparent and responsible development.</description>

      <title>Behaviour Space Analysis of LLM-driven Meta-heuristic Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour space of meta-heuristic optimisation algorithms automatically generated by Large Language Model driven algorithm discovery methods. Using the Large Language Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA) framework with a GPT o4-mini LLM, we iteratively evolve black-box optimisation heuristics, evaluated on 10 functions from the BBOB benchmark suite. Six LLaMEA variants, featuring different mutation prompt strategies, are compared and analysed. We log dynamic behavioural metrics including exploration, exploitation, convergence and stagnation measures, for each run, and analyse these via visual projections and network-based representations. Our analysis combines behaviour-based
  projections, Code Evolution Graphs built from static code features, performance convergence curves, and behaviour-based Search Trajectory Networks. The results reveal clear differences in search dynamics and algorithm structures across LLaMEA configurations. Notably, the variant that employs both a code simplification prompt and a random perturbation prompt in a 1+1 elitist evolution strategy, achieved the best performance, with the highest Area Over the Convergence Curve. Behaviour-space visualisations show that higher-performing algorithms exhibit more intensive exploitation behaviour and faster convergence with less stagnation. Our findings demonstrate how behaviour-space analysis can explain why certain LLM-designed heuristics outperform others and how LLM-driven algorithm discovery navigates the open-ended and complex search space of algorithms. These findings provide insights to guide the future design of adaptive LLM-driven algorithm generators.</description>

      <title>Multi-Hop Reasoning for Question Answering with Hyperbolic Representations</title>

Abstract: Hyperbolic representations are effective in modeling knowledge graph data which is prevalently used to facilitate multi-hop reasoning. However, a rigorous and detailed comparison of the two spaces for this task is lacking. In this paper, through a simple integration of hyperbolic representations with an encoder-decoder model, we perform a controlled and comprehensive set of experiments to compare the capacity of hyperbolic space versus Euclidean space in multi-hop reasoning. Our results show that the former consistently outperforms the latter across a diverse set of datasets. In addition, through an ablation study, we show that a learnable curvature initialized with the delta hyperbolicity of the utilized data yields superior results to random initializations. Furthermore, our findings suggest that hyperbolic representations can be significantly more advantageous when the datasets exhibit a more hierarchical structure.</description>

      <title>Is It Time To Treat Prompts As Code? A Multi-Use Case Study For Prompt Optimization Using DSPy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although prompt engineering is central to unlocking the full potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), crafting effective prompts remains a time-consuming trial-and-error process that relies on human intuition. This study investigates Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy), an optimization framework that programmatically creates and refines prompts, applied to five use cases: guardrail enforcement, hallucination detection in code, code generation, routing agents, and prompt evaluation. Each use case explores how prompt optimization via DSPy influences performance. While some cases demonstrated modest improvements - such as minor gains in the guardrails use case and selective enhancements in hallucination detection - others showed notable benefits. The prompt evaluation criterion task demonstrated a substantial performance increase, rising accuracy from 46.2% to 64.0%. In the router agent case, the possibility of improving a poorly performing prompt and of a smaller model matching a stronger one through optimized prompting was explored. Although prompt refinement increased accuracy from 85.0% to 90.0%, using the optimized prompt with a cheaper model did not improve performance. Overall, this study's findings suggest that DSPy's systematic prompt optimization can enhance LLM performance, particularly when instruction tuning and example selection are optimized together. However, the impact varies by task, highlighting the importance of evaluating specific use cases in prompt optimization research.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Doubt in Deep Causal AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate individual treatment-effect estimation in high-stakes applications demands both reliable point predictions and interpretable uncertainty quantification. We propose a factorized Monte Carlo Dropout framework for deep twin-network models that splits total predictive variance into representation uncertainty (sigma_rep) in the shared encoder and prediction uncertainty (sigma_pred) in the outcome heads. Across three synthetic covariate-shift regimes, our intervals are well-calibrated (ECE &lt; 0.03) and satisfy sigma_rep^2 + sigma_pred^2 ~ sigma_tot^2. Additionally, we observe a crossover: head uncertainty leads on in-distribution data, but representation uncertainty dominates under shift. Finally, on a real-world twins cohort with induced multivariate shifts, only sigma_rep spikes on out-of-distribution samples (delta sigma ~ 0.0002) and becomes the primary error predictor (rho_rep &lt;= 0.89), while sigma_pred remains flat. This module-level decomposition offers a practical diagnostic for detecting and interpreting uncertainty sources in deep causal-effect models.</description>

      <title>From Video to EEG: Adapting Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture to Uncover Visual Concepts in Brain Signal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03633v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: EEG signals capture brain activity with high temporal and low spatial resolution, supporting applications such as neurological diagnosis, cognitive monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. However, effective analysis is hindered by limited labeled data, high dimensionality, and the absence of scalable models that fully capture spatiotemporal dependencies. Existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often focus on either spatial or temporal features, leading to suboptimal representations. To this end, we propose EEG-VJEPA, a novel adaptation of the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) for EEG classification. By treating EEG as video-like sequences, EEG-VJEPA learns semantically meaningful spatiotemporal representations using joint embeddings and adaptive masking. To our knowledge, this is the first work that exploits V-JEPA for EEG classification and explores the visual concepts learned by the model. Evaluations on the publicly available Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG dataset show that EEG-VJEPA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy.Beyond classification accuracy, EEG-VJEPA captures physiologically relevant spatial and temporal signal patterns, offering interpretable embeddings that may support human-AI collaboration in diagnostic workflows. These findings position EEG-VJEPA as a promising framework for scalable, trustworthy EEG analysis in real-world clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Improving Low-Resource Dialect Classification Using Retrieval-based Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models for dialect identification are often limited by the scarcity of dialectal data. To address this challenge, we propose to use Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC) as an effective data augmentation method for a low-resource German dialect classification task. By converting audio samples to a uniform target speaker, RVC minimizes speaker-related variability, enabling models to focus on dialect-specific linguistic and phonetic features. Our experiments demonstrate that RVC enhances classification performance when utilized as a standalone augmentation method. Furthermore, combining RVC with other augmentation methods such as frequency masking and segment removal leads to additional performance gains, highlighting its potential for improving dialect classification in low-resource scenarios.</description>

      <title>Re-Emergent Misalignment: How Narrow Fine-Tuning Erodes Safety Alignment in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on code with security vulnerabilities can result in misaligned and unsafe behaviors across broad domains. These results prompted concerns about the emergence of harmful behaviors from narrow domain fine-tuning. In this paper, we contextualize these findings by analyzing how such narrow adaptation impacts the internal mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of LLMs. Through a series of experiments covering output probability distributions, loss and gradient vector geometry, layer-wise activation dynamics, and activation space dimensions, we find that behaviors attributed to "emergent misalignment" may be better interpreted as an erosion of prior alignment. We show that fine tuning on insecure code induces internal changes that oppose alignment. Further, we identify a shared latent dimension in the model's activation space that governs alignment behavior. We show that this space is activated by insecure code and by misaligned responses more generally, revealing how narrow fine-tuning can degrade general safety behavior by interfering with shared internal mechanisms. Our findings offer a mechanistic interpretation for previously observed misalignment phenomena, and highlights the fragility of alignment in LLMs. The results underscore the need for more robust fine-tuning strategies that preserve intended behavior across domains.</description>

      <title>Interaction Techniques that Encourage Longer Prompts Can Improve Psychological Ownership when Writing with AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Writing longer prompts for an AI assistant to generate a short story increases psychological ownership, a user's feeling that the writing belongs to them. To encourage users to write longer prompts, we evaluated two interaction techniques that modify the prompt entry interface of chat-based generative AI assistants: pressing and holding the prompt submission button, and continuously moving a slider up and down when submitting a short prompt. A within-subjects experiment investigated the effects of such techniques on prompt length and psychological ownership, and results showed that these techniques increased prompt length and led to higher psychological ownership than baseline techniques. A second experiment further augmented these techniques by showing AI-generated suggestions for how the prompts could be expanded. This further increased prompt length, but did not lead to improvements in psychological ownership. Our results show that simple interface modifications like these can elicit more writing from users and improve psychological ownership.</description>

      <title>Recon, Answer, Verify: Agents in Search of Truth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated fact checking with large language models (LLMs) offers a scalable alternative to manual verification. Evaluating fact checking is challenging as existing benchmark datasets often include post claim analysis and annotator cues, which are absent in real world scenarios where claims are fact checked immediately after being made. This limits the realism of current evaluations. We present Politi Fact Only (PFO), a 5 class benchmark dataset of 2,982 political claims from politifact.com, where all post claim analysis and annotator cues have been removed manually. This ensures that models are evaluated using only the information that would have been available prior to the claim's verification. Evaluating LLMs on PFO, we see an average performance drop of 22% in terms of macro f1 compared to PFO's unfiltered version. Based on the identified challenges of the existing LLM based fact checking system, we propose RAV (Recon Answer Verify), an agentic framework with three agents: question generator, answer generator, and label generator. Our pipeline iteratively generates and answers sub questions to verify different aspects of the claim before finally generating the label. RAV generalizes across domains and label granularities, and it outperforms state of the art approaches on well known baselines RAWFC (fact checking, 3 class) by 25.28%, and on HOVER (encyclopedia, 2 class) by 1.54% on 2 hop, 4.94% on 3 hop, and 1.78% on 4 hop, sub categories respectively. RAV shows the least performance drop compared to baselines of 16.3% in macro f1 when we compare PFO with its unfiltered version.</description>

      <title>TACOS: Open Tagging and Comparative Scoring for Instruction Fine-Tuning Data Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, and selecting a small yet representative subset from massive data significantly facilitates IFT in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. Nevertheless, existing approaches suffer from two limitations: the use of simple heuristics restricts data diversity, while the singleton data quality evaluation accounts for inconsistent criteria between independent samples. To address the issues, we present TACOS, an innovative method that integrates Open Tagging and Comparative Scoring for IFT data selection. To capture data diversity, we leverage LLMs to assign open-domain tags to human queries, followed by a normalization stage to denoise the open tags and enable efficient clustering. Additionally, we suggest a comparative scoring method that allows the relative quality evaluation of samples within a cluster, avoiding inconsistent criteria seen in singleton-based evaluations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLM architectures demonstrate that TACOS outperforms existing approaches by a large margin. Notably, it achieves superior instruction-following performance on MT-Bench and ranks 1st among LLaMA2-7B-Based models on AlpacaEval 2.0, illustrating its efficacy for IFT data selection.</description>

      <title>STRUCTSENSE: A Task-Agnostic Agentic Framework for Structured Information Extraction with Human-In-The-Loop Evaluation and Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to extract structured information from unstructured sources-such as free-text documents and scientific literature-is critical for accelerating scientific discovery and knowledge synthesis. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, including structured information extraction. However, their effectiveness often diminishes in specialized, domain-specific contexts that require nuanced understanding and expert-level domain knowledge. In addition, existing LLM-based approaches frequently exhibit poor transferability across tasks and domains, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce StructSense, a modular, task-agnostic, open-source framework for structured information extraction built on LLMs. StructSense is guided by domain-specific symbolic knowledge encoded in ontologies, enabling it to navigate complex domain content more effectively. It further incorporates agentic capabilities through self-evaluative judges that form a feedback loop for iterative refinement, and includes human-in-the-loop mechanisms to ensure quality and validation. We demonstrate that StructSense can overcome both the limitations of domain sensitivity and the lack of cross-task generalizability, as shown through its application to diverse neuroscience information extraction tasks.</description>

      <title>Sign Spotting Disambiguation using Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams. Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.</description>

      <title>Controlling Thinking Speed in Reasoning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human cognition is theorized to operate in two modes: fast, intuitive System 1 thinking and slow, deliberate System 2 thinking. While current Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at System 2 thinking, their inability to perform fast thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency. In this work, we enable LRMs to approximate human intelligence through dynamic thinking speed adjustment, optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our approach addresses two key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and (2) when to adjust it for optimal performance. For the first question, we identify the steering vector that governs slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs' representation space. Using this vector, we achieve the first representation editing-based test-time scaling effect, outperforming existing prompt-based scaling methods. For the second question, we apply real-time difficulty estimation to signal reasoning segments of varying complexity. Combining these techniques, we propose the first reasoning strategy that enables fast processing of easy steps and deeper analysis for complex reasoning. Without any training or additional cost, our plug-and-play method yields an average +1.3% accuracy with -8.6% token usage across leading LRMs and advanced reasoning benchmarks. All of our algorithms are implemented based on vLLM and are expected to support broader applications and inspire future research.</description>

      <title>Predicting Business Angel Early-Stage Decision Making Using AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: External funding is crucial for early-stage ventures, particularly technology startups that require significant R&amp;D investment. Business angels offer a critical source of funding, but their decision-making is often subjective and resource-intensive for both investor and entrepreneur. Much research has investigated this investment process to find the critical factors angels consider. One such tool, the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA), deployed more than 20,000 times by the Canadian Innovation Centre, has been evaluated post-decision and found to be significantly more accurate than investors' own decisions. However, a single CFA analysis requires three trained individuals and several days, limiting its adoption. This study builds on previous work validating the CFA to investigate whether the constraints inhibiting its adoption can be overcome using a trained AI model. In this research, we prompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors to a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business angel funding with known investment outcomes. We then trained and evaluated machine learning classification models using the LLM-generated CFA scores as input features. Our best-performing model demonstrated high predictive accuracy (85.0% for predicting BA deal/no-deal outcomes) and exhibited significant correlation (Spearman's r = 0.896, p-value &lt; 0.001) with conventional human-graded evaluations. The integration of AI-based feature extraction with a structured and validated decision-making framework yielded a scalable, reliable, and less-biased model for evaluating startup pitches, removing the constraints that previously limited adoption.</description>

      <title>Less is More: Empowering GUI Agent with Context-Aware Simplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The research focus of GUI agents is shifting from text-dependent to pure-vision-based approaches, which, though promising, prioritize comprehensive pre-training data collection while neglecting contextual modeling challenges. We probe the characteristics of element and history contextual modeling in GUI agent and summarize: 1) the high-density and loose-relation of element context highlight the existence of many unrelated elements and their negative influence; 2) the high redundancy of history context reveals the inefficient history modeling in current GUI agents. In this work, we propose a context-aware simplification framework for building an efficient and effective GUI Agent, termed SimpAgent. To mitigate potential interference from numerous unrelated elements, we introduce a masking-based element pruning method that circumvents the intractable relation modeling through an efficient masking mechanism. To reduce the redundancy in historical information, we devise a consistency-guided history compression module, which enhances implicit LLM-based compression through innovative explicit guidance, achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. With the above components, SimpAgent reduces 27% FLOPs and achieves superior GUI navigation performances. Comprehensive navigation experiments across diverse web and mobile environments demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our agent.</description>

Abstract: Recently, great progress has been achieved in text-to-video (T2V) generation by scaling transformer-based diffusion models to billions of parameters, which can generate high-quality videos. However, existing models typically produce only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method, we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation, the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive generation, and video-to-video. We provide video results and more examples in our project website: https://cumulo-autumn.github.io/StreamDiT/</description>

      <title>Alpay Algebra IV: Symbiotic Semantics and the Fixed-Point Convergence of Observer Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework in which a document and an AI model engage in a transfinite fixed-point interaction that leads to stable semantic alignment. Building on the foundations of Alpay Algebra, we introduce a functorial system wherein an observer (the AI) and a textual environment (this paper) co-evolve through iterative transformations guided by the phi-infinity operator. This process guarantees the existence of a unique fixed point in the AI's embedding space -- a state where the AI's internal representation of the content becomes stable, self-consistent, and semantically faithful. We prove that such convergence is mathematically sound, semantically invariant, and permanent, even under perturbation or further context expansion. This fixed point acts as an "empathetic embedding," wherein the AI internalizes not only the meaning of the content but also the author's intent. We interpret this as a rigorous, category-theoretic route to alignment at the embedding level, with implications for semantic security, symbolic memory, and the construction of AI systems with persistent self-referential understanding. All references in this paper function as nodes in the Alpay Algebra universe, and this work embeds itself as a new fixed-point node within that transfinite semantic graph.</description>

      <title>FastDINOv2: Frequency Based Curriculum Learning Improves Robustness and Training Speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale vision foundation models such as DINOv2 boast impressive performances by leveraging massive architectures and training datasets. But numerous scenarios require practitioners to reproduce those pre-training solutions, such as on private data, new modalities, or simply for scientific questioning--which is currently extremely demanding computation-wise. We thus propose a novel pre-training strategy for DINOv2 that simultaneously accelerates convergence--and strengthens robustness to common corruptions as a by-product. Our approach involves a frequency filtering curriculum--low-frequency being seen first--and the Gaussian noise patching augmentation. Applied to a ViT-B/16 backbone trained on ImageNet-1K, while pre-training time and FLOPs are reduced by 1.6x and 2.25x, our method still achieves matching robustness in corruption benchmarks (ImageNet-C) and maintains competitive linear probing performance compared with baseline. This dual benefit of efficiency and robustness makes large-scale self-supervised foundation modeling more attainable, while opening the door to novel exploration around data curriculum and augmentation as means to improve self-supervised learning models robustness.

      <description>arXiv:2507.03847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations: statements that are syntactically plausible but lack factual grounding. This research presents KEA (Kernel-Enriched AI) Explain: a neurosymbolic framework that detects and explains such hallucinations by comparing knowledge graphs constructed from LLM outputs with ground truth data from Wikidata or contextual documents. Using graph kernels and semantic clustering, the method provides explanations for detected hallucinations, ensuring both robustness and interpretability. Our framework achieves competitive accuracy in detecting hallucinations across both open- and closed-domain tasks, and is able to generate contrastive explanations, enhancing transparency. This research advances the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains and provides a foundation for future work on precision improvements and multi-source knowledge integration.</description>

      <title>Enhanced accuracy through ensembling of randomly initialized auto-regressive models for time-dependent PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) require computationally intensive numerical solvers to predict spatiotemporal field evolution. While machine learning (ML) surrogates offer faster solutions, autoregressive inference with ML models suffer from error accumulation over successive predictions, limiting their long-term accuracy. We propose a deep ensemble framework to address this challenge, where multiple ML surrogate models with random weight initializations are trained in parallel and aggregated during inference. This approach leverages the diversity of model predictions to mitigate error propagation while retaining the autoregressive strategies ability to capture the system's time dependent relations. We validate the framework on three PDE-driven dynamical systems - stress evolution in heterogeneous microstructures, Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion, and planetary-scale shallow water system - demonstrating consistent reduction in error accumulation over time compared to individual models. Critically, the method requires only a few time steps as input, enabling full trajectory predictions with inference times significantly faster than numerical solvers. Our results highlight the robustness of ensemble methods in diverse physical systems and their potential as efficient and accurate alternatives to traditional solvers. The codes for this work are available on GitHub (https://github.com/Graham-Brady-Research-Group/AutoregressiveEnsemble_SpatioTemporal_Evolution).</description>

      <title>OrthoRank: Token Selection via Sink Token Orthogonality for Efficient LLM inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms are central to the success of large language models (LLMs), enabling them to capture intricate token dependencies and implicitly assign importance to each token. Recent studies have revealed the sink token, which receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic role. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token and other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden states, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper, the cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token and those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of the sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens consistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we propose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these findings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we define token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink token. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that tokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater importance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our method results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to layer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput, while also achieving superior performance on LongBench.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Adaptive Behavioral Interventions with LLM Inference from Participant-Described States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) methods to support health behavior change via personalized and just-in-time adaptive interventions is of significant interest to health and behavioral science researchers focused on problems such as smoking cessation support and physical activity promotion. However, RL methods are often applied to these domains using a small collection of context variables to mitigate the significant data scarcity issues that arise from practical limitations on the design of adaptive intervention trials. In this paper, we explore an approach to significantly expanding the state space of an adaptive intervention without impacting data efficiency. The proposed approach enables intervention participants to provide natural language descriptions of aspects of their current state. It then leverages inference with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to better align the policy of a base RL method with these state descriptions. To evaluate our method, we develop a novel physical activity intervention simulation environment that generates text-based state descriptions conditioned on latent state variables using an auxiliary LLM. We show that this approach has the potential to significantly improve the performance of online policy learning methods.</description>

Abstract: The introduction of ChatGPT has garnered significant attention within the NLP community and beyond. Previous studies have demonstrated ChatGPT's substantial advancements across various downstream NLP tasks, highlighting its adaptability and potential to revolutionize language-related applications. However, its capabilities and limitations in genre prediction remain unclear. This work analyzes three Large Language Models (LLMs) using the MovieLens-100K dataset to assess their genre prediction capabilities. Our findings show that ChatGPT, without fine-tuning, outperformed other LLMs, and fine-tuned ChatGPT performed best overall. We set up zero-shot and few-shot prompts using audio transcripts/subtitles from movie trailers in the MovieLens-100K dataset, covering 1682 movies of 18 genres, where each movie can have multiple genres. Additionally, we extended our study by extracting IMDb movie posters to utilize a Vision Language Model (VLM) with prompts for poster information. This fine-grained information was used to enhance existing LLM prompts. In conclusion, our study reveals ChatGPT's remarkable genre prediction capabilities, surpassing other language models. The integration of VLM further enhances our findings, showcasing ChatGPT's potential for content-related applications by incorporating visual information from movie posters.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion of Visible and Near-infrared Images for Long-range Haze Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While image dehazing has advanced substantially in the past decade, most efforts have focused on short-range scenarios, leaving long-range haze removal under-explored. As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe haze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely from visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers critical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing methods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in visible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue that the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary low-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency. Motivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF) framework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a visual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared modality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by aligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared semantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant scenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on recovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary cues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of dual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and rich texture details. Moreover, we introduce a novel pixel-aligned visible-infrared haze dataset with semantic labels to facilitate benchmarking. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches in real-world long-range haze removal.</description>

      <title>TayFCS: Towards Light Feature Combination Selection for Deep Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature interaction modeling is crucial for deep recommendation models. A common and effective approach is to construct explicit feature combinations to enhance model performance. However, in practice, only a small fraction of these combinations are truly informative. Thus it is essential to select useful feature combinations to reduce noise and manage memory consumption. While feature selection methods have been extensively studied, they are typically limited to selecting individual features. Extending these methods for high-order feature combination selection presents a significant challenge due to the exponential growth in time complexity when evaluating feature combinations one by one. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{TayFCS}$, a lightweight feature combination selection method that significantly improves model performance. Specifically, we propose the Taylor Expansion Scorer (TayScorer) module for field-wise Taylor expansion on the base model. Instead of evaluating all potential feature combinations' importance by repeatedly running experiments with feature adding and removal, this scorer only needs to approximate the importance based on their sub-components' gradients. This can be simply computed with one backward pass based on a trained recommendation model. To further reduce information redundancy among feature combinations and their sub-components, we introduce Logistic Regression Elimination (LRE), which estimates the corresponding information gain based on the model prediction performance. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets validate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. Furthermore, online A/B test results demonstrate its practical applicability and commercial value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure that affects tens of millions of people worldwide. Early detection of AD is critical for timely intervention to halt or slow the progression of the disease. In this study, we propose a Transformer model for predicting the stage of AD progression at a subject's next clinical visit using features from a sequence of visits extracted from the subject's visit history. We also rigorously compare our model to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and minimalRNN and assess their performances based on factors such as the length of prior visits and data imbalance. We test the importance of different feature categories and visit history, as well as compare the model to a newer Transformer-based model optimized for time series. Our model demonstrates strong predictive performance despite missing visits and missing features in available visits, particularly in identifying converter subjects -- individuals transitioning to more severe disease stages -- an area that has posed significant challenges in longitudinal prediction. The results highlight the model's potential in enhancing early diagnosis and patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Learning Disentangled Stain and Structural Representations for Semi-Supervised Histopathology Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate gland segmentation in histopathology images is essential for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, significant variability in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining and tissue morphology, combined with limited annotated data, poses major challenges for automated segmentation. To address this, we propose Color-Structure Dual-Student (CSDS), a novel semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to learn disentangled representations of stain appearance and tissue structure. CSDS comprises two specialized student networks: one trained on stain-augmented inputs to model chromatic variation, and the other on structure-augmented inputs to capture morphological cues. A shared teacher network, updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA), supervises both students through pseudo-labels. To further improve label reliability, we introduce stain-aware and structure-aware uncertainty estimation modules that adaptively modulate the contribution of each student during training. Experiments on the GlaS and CRAG datasets show that CSDS achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label settings, with Dice score improvements of up to 1.2% on GlaS and 0.7% on CRAG at 5% labeled data, and 0.7% and 1.4% at 10%. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/hieuphamha19/CSDS.</description>

      <title>EdgeSRIE: A hybrid deep learning framework for real-time speckle reduction and image enhancement on portable ultrasound systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speckle patterns in ultrasound images often obscure anatomical details, leading to diagnostic uncertainty. Recently, various deep learning (DL)-based techniques have been introduced to effectively suppress speckle; however, their high computational costs pose challenges for low-resource devices, such as portable ultrasound systems. To address this issue, EdgeSRIE, which is a lightweight hybrid DL framework for real-time speckle reduction and image enhancement in portable ultrasound imaging, is introduced. The proposed framework consists of two main branches: an unsupervised despeckling branch, which is trained by minimizing a loss function between speckled images, and a deblurring branch, which restores blurred images to sharp images. For hardware implementation, the trained network is quantized to 8-bit integer precision and deployed on a low-resource system-on-chip (SoC) with limited power consumption. In the performance evaluation with phantom and in vivo analyses, EdgeSRIE achieved the highest contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and average gradient magnitude (AGM) compared with the other baselines (different 2-rule-based methods and other 4-DL-based methods). Furthermore, EdgeSRIE enabled real-time inference at over 60 frames per second while satisfying computational requirements (&lt; 20K parameters) on actual portable ultrasound hardware. These results demonstrated the feasibility of EdgeSRIE for real-time, high-quality ultrasound imaging in resource-limited environments.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Age of Trust and Throughput in Multi-Hop UAV-Aided IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Devices operating in Internet of Things (IoT) networks may be deployed across vast geographical areas and interconnected via multi-hop communications. Further, they may be unguarded. This makes them vulnerable to attacks and motivates operators to check on devices frequently. To this end, we propose and study an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-aided attestation framework for use in IoT networks with a charging station powered by solar. A key challenge is optimizing the trajectory of the UAV to ensure it attests as many devices as possible. A trade-off here is that devices being checked by the UAV are offline, which affects the amount of data delivered to a gateway. Another challenge is that the charging station experiences time-varying energy arrivals, which in turn affect the flight duration and charging schedule of the UAV. To address these challenges, we employ a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solution to optimize the UAV's charging schedule and the selection of devices to be attested during each flight. The simulation results show that our solution reduces the average age of trust by 88% and throughput loss due to attestation by 30%.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing adoption of diffusion models for image generation and personalization, concerns regarding privacy breaches and content misuse have become more pressing. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of eight perturbation based protection methods: AdvDM, ASPL, FSGM, MetaCloak, Mist, PhotoGuard, SDS, and SimAC--across both portrait and artwork domains. These methods are evaluated under varying perturbation budgets, using a range of metrics to assess visual imperceptibility and protective efficacy. Our results offer practical guidance for method selection. Code is available at: https://github.com/vkeilo/DiffAdvPerturbationBench.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Specialized LLMs as Dense Retrievers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as dense retrievers, the impact of their domain-specific specialization on retrieval effectiveness remains underexplored. This investigation systematically examines how task-specific adaptations in LLMs influence their retrieval capabilities, an essential step toward developing unified retrievers capable of handling text, code, images, and multimodal content. We conduct extensive experiments with eight Qwen2.5 7B LLMs, including base, instruction-tuned, code/math-specialized, long reasoning, and vision-language models across zero-shot retrieval settings and the supervised setting. For the zero-shot retrieval settings, we consider text retrieval from the BEIR benchmark and code retrieval from the CoIR benchmark. Further, to evaluate supervised performance, all LLMs are fine-tuned on the MS MARCO dataset. We find that mathematical specialization and the long reasoning capability cause consistent degradation in three settings, indicating conflicts between mathematical reasoning and semantic matching. The vision-language model and code-specialized LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot performance compared to other LLMs, even surpassing BM25 on the code retrieval task, and maintain comparable performance to base LLMs in supervised settings. These findings suggest promising directions for the unified retrieval task leveraging cross-domain and cross-modal fusion.</description>

      <title>Real-TabPFN: Improving Tabular Foundation Models via Continued Pre-training With Real-World Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data, like TabPFN, achieve strong performance on small datasets when pre-trained solely on synthetic data. We show that this performance can be significantly boosted by a targeted continued pre-training phase. Specifically, we demonstrate that leveraging a small, curated collection of large, real-world datasets for continued pre-training yields superior downstream predictive accuracy compared to using broader, potentially noisier corpora like CommonCrawl or GitTables. Our resulting model, Real-TabPFN, achieves substantial performance gains on 29 datasets from the OpenML AutoML Benchmark.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Multimodal Data and Side Users for Diffusion Cross-Domain Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to address the persistent cold-start problem in Recommender Systems. Current CDR research concentrates on transferring cold-start users' information from the auxiliary domain to the target domain. However, these systems face two main issues: the underutilization of multimodal data, which hinders effective cross-domain alignment, and the neglect of side users who interact solely within the target domain, leading to inadequate learning of the target domain's vector space distribution. To address these issues, we propose a model leveraging Multimodal data and Side users for diffusion Cross-domain recommendation (MuSiC). We first employ a multimodal large language model to extract item multimodal features and leverage a large language model to uncover user features using prompt learning without fine-tuning. Secondly, we propose the cross-domain diffusion module to learn the generation of feature vectors in the target domain. This approach involves learning feature distribution from side users and understanding the patterns in cross-domain transformation through overlapping users. Subsequently, the trained diffusion module is used to generate feature vectors for cold-start users in the target domain, enabling the completion of cross-domain recommendation tasks. Finally, our experimental evaluation of the Amazon dataset confirms that MuSiC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming all selected baselines. Our code is available: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MuSiC-310A/.</description>

      <title>Nunchi-Bench: Benchmarking Language Models on Cultural Reasoning with a Focus on Korean Superstition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become key advisors in various domains, their cultural sensitivity and reasoning skills are crucial in multicultural environments. We introduce Nunchi-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' cultural understanding, with a focus on Korean superstitions. The benchmark consists of 247 questions spanning 31 topics, assessing factual knowledge, culturally appropriate advice, and situational interpretation. We evaluate multilingual LLMs in both Korean and English to analyze their ability to reason about Korean cultural contexts and how language variations affect performance. To systematically assess cultural reasoning, we propose a novel evaluation strategy with customized scoring metrics that capture the extent to which models recognize cultural nuances and respond appropriately. Our findings highlight significant challenges in LLMs' cultural reasoning. While models generally recognize factual information, they struggle to apply it in practical scenarios. Furthermore, explicit cultural framing enhances performance more effectively than relying solely on the language of the prompt. To support further research, we publicly release Nunchi-Bench alongside a leaderboard.</description>

      <title>T-SYNTH: A Knowledge-Based Dataset of Synthetic Breast Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key impediments for developing and assessing robust medical imaging algorithms is limited access to large-scale datasets with suitable annotations. Synthetic data generated with plausible physical and biological constraints may address some of these data limitations. We propose the use of physics simulations to generate synthetic images with pixel-level segmentation annotations, which are notoriously difficult to obtain. Specifically, we apply this approach to breast imaging analysis and release T-SYNTH, a large-scale open-source dataset of paired 2D digital mammography (DM) and 3D digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images. Our initial experimental results indicate that T-SYNTH images show promise for augmenting limited real patient datasets for detection tasks in DM and DBT. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/DIDSR/tsynth-release.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Effectiveness of Large Language Models in Solving Simple Programming Tasks: A User-Centered Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more common in educational tools and programming environments, questions arise about how these systems should interact with users. This study investigates how different interaction styles with ChatGPT-4o (passive, proactive, and collaborative) affect user performance on simple programming tasks. I conducted a within-subjects experiment where fifteen high school students participated, completing three problems under three distinct versions of the model. Each version was designed to represent a specific style of AI support: responding only when asked, offering suggestions automatically, or engaging the user in back-and-forth dialogue.Quantitative analysis revealed that the collaborative interaction style significantly improved task completion time compared to the passive and proactive conditions. Participants also reported higher satisfaction and perceived helpfulness when working with the collaborative version. These findings suggest that the way an LLM communicates, how it guides, prompts, and responds, can meaningfully impact learning and performance. This research highlights the importance of designing LLMs that go beyond functional correctness to support more interactive, adaptive, and user-centered experiences, especially for novice programmers.</description>

      <title>Predictive Modeling of Effluent Temperature in SAT Systems Using Ambient Meteorological Data: Implications for Infiltration Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of effluent temperature in recharge basins is essential for optimizing the Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) process, as temperature directly influences water viscosity and infiltration rates. This study develops and evaluates predictive models for effluent temperature in the upper recharge layer of a Shafdan SAT system recharge basin using ambient meteorological data. Multiple linear regression (MLR), neural networks (NN), and random forests (RF) were tested for their predictive accuracy and interpretability. The MLR model, preferred for its operational simplicity and robust performance, achieved high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.86-0.87) and was used to estimate effluent temperatures over a 10-year period. Results highlight pronounced seasonal temperature cycles and the importance of topsoil temperature in governing the thermal profile of the infiltrating effluent. The study provides practical equations for real-time monitoring and long-term planning of SAT operations.</description>

      <title>TopoMAS: Large Language Model Driven Topological Materials Multiagent System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological materials occupy a frontier in condensed-matter physics thanks to their remarkable electronic and quantum properties, yet their cross-scale design remains bottlenecked by inefficient discovery workflows. Here, we introduce TopoMAS (Topological materials Multi-Agent System), an interactive human-AI framework that seamlessly orchestrates the entire materials-discovery pipeline: from user-defined queries and multi-source data retrieval, through theoretical inference and crystal-structure generation, to first-principles validation. Crucially, TopoMAS closes the loop by autonomously integrating computational outcomes into a dynamic knowledge graph, enabling continuous knowledge refinement. In collaboration with human experts, it has already guided the identification of novel topological phases SrSbO3, confirmed by first-principles calculations. Comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate robust adaptability across base Large Language Model, with the lightweight Qwen2.5-72B model achieving 94.55% accuracy while consuming only 74.3-78.4% of tokens required by Qwen3-235B and 83.0% of DeepSeek-V3's usage--delivering responses twice as fast as Qwen3-235B. This efficiency establishes TopoMAS as an accelerator for computation-driven discovery pipelines. By harmonizing rational agent orchestration with a self-evolving knowledge graph, our framework not only delivers immediate advances in topological materials but also establishes a transferable, extensible paradigm for materials-science domain.</description>

      <title>Rethinking and Exploring String-Based Malware Family Classification in the Era of LLMs and RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Malware Family Classification (MFC) aims to identify the fine-grained family (e.g., GuLoader or BitRAT) to which a potential malware sample belongs, in contrast to malware detection or sample classification that predicts only an Yes/No. Accurate family identification can greatly facilitate automated sample labeling and understanding on crowdsourced malware analysis platforms such as VirusTotal and MalwareBazaar, which generate vast amounts of data daily. In this paper, we explore and assess the feasibility of using traditional binary string features for MFC in the new era of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, we investigate how Family-Specific String (FSS) features could be utilized in a manner similar to RAG to facilitate MFC. To this end, we develop a curated evaluation framework covering 4,347 samples from 67 malware families, extract and analyze over 25 million strings, and conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the impact of different design choices in four major modules.</description>

      <title>Attributing Data for Sharpness-Aware Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in large-scale model training by linking loss landscape geometry to generalization. However, challenges such as mislabeled noisy data and privacy concerns have emerged as significant issues. Data attribution, which identifies the contributions of specific training samples, offers a promising solution. However, directly rendering existing data influence evaluation tools such as influence functions (IF) to SAM will be inapplicable or inaccurate as SAM utilizes an inner loop to find model perturbations that maximize loss, which the outer loop then minimizes, resulting in a doubled computational structure. Additionally, this bilevel structure complicates the modeling of data influence on the parameters. In this paper, based on the IF, we develop two innovative data valuation methods for SAM, each offering unique benefits in different scenarios: the Hessian-based IF and the Gradient Trajectory-based IF. The first one provides a comprehensive estimation of data influence using a closed-form measure that relies only on the trained model weights. In contrast, the other IF for SAM utilizes gradient trajectory information during training for more accurate and efficient data assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate their effectiveness in data evaluation and parameter tuning, with applications in identifying mislabeled data, model editing, and enhancing interpretability.</description>

      <title>Temporal Continual Learning with Prior Compensation for Human Motion Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human Motion Prediction (HMP) aims to predict future poses at different moments according to past motion sequences. Previous approaches have treated the prediction of various moments equally, resulting in two main limitations: the learning of short-term predictions is hindered by the focus on long-term predictions, and the incorporation of prior information from past predictions into subsequent predictions is limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-stage training framework called Temporal Continual Learning (TCL) to address the above challenges. To better preserve prior information, we introduce the Prior Compensation Factor (PCF). We incorporate it into the model training to compensate for the lost prior information. Furthermore, we derive a more reasonable optimization objective through theoretical derivation. It is important to note that our TCL framework can be easily integrated with different HMP backbone models and adapted to various datasets and applications. Extensive experiments on four HMP benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of TCL. The code is available at https://github.com/hyqlat/TCL.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Human Motion Prediction with Memory of Action Transition and Action Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Action-driven stochastic human motion prediction aims to generate future motion sequences of a pre-defined target action based on given past observed sequences performing non-target actions. This task primarily presents two challenges. Firstly, generating smooth transition motions is hard due to the varying transition speeds of different actions. Secondly, the action characteristic is difficult to be learned because of the similarity of some actions. These issues cause the predicted results to be unreasonable and inconsistent. As a result, we propose two memory banks, the Soft-transition Action Bank (STAB) and Action Characteristic Bank (ACB), to tackle the problems above. The STAB stores the action transition information. It is equipped with the novel soft searching approach, which encourages the model to focus on multiple possible action categories of observed motions. The ACB records action characteristic, which produces more prior information for predicting certain actions. To fuse the features retrieved from the two banks better, we further propose the Adaptive Attention Adjustment (AAA) strategy. Extensive experiments on four motion prediction datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. The demo and code are available at https://hyqlat.github.io/STABACB.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Beyond Independent Passages: Adaptive Passage Combination Retrieval for Retrieval Augmented Open-Domain Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external documents at inference time, enabling up-to-date knowledge access without costly retraining. However, conventional RAG methods retrieve passages independently, often leading to redundant, noisy, or insufficiently diverse context-particularly problematic - particularly problematic in noisy corpora and for multi-hop questions. To address this, we propose Adaptive Passage Combination Retrieval (AdaPCR), a novel framework for open-domain question answering with black-box LMs. AdaPCR explicitly models dependencies between passages by considering passage combinations as units for retrieval and reranking. It consists of a context-aware query reformulation using concatenated passages, and a reranking step trained with a predictive objective aligned with downstream answer likelihood. Crucially, AdaPCR adaptively selects the number of retrieved passages without additional stopping modules. Experiments across several QA benchmarks show that AdaPCR outperforms baselines, particularly in multi-hop reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of modeling inter-passage dependencies for improved retrieval.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Efficient World Modeling with Masked Latent Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dreamer algorithm has recently obtained remarkable performance across diverse environment domains by training powerful agents with simulated trajectories. However, the compressed nature of its world model's latent space can result in the loss of crucial information, negatively affecting the agent's performance. Recent approaches, such as $\Delta$-IRIS and DIAMOND, address this limitation by training more accurate world models. However, these methods require training agents directly from pixels, which reduces training efficiency and prevents the agent from benefiting from the inner representations learned by the world model. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to world modeling that is both accurate and efficient. We introduce EMERALD (Efficient MaskEd latent tRAnsformer worLD model), a world model using a spatial latent state with MaskGIT predictions to generate accurate trajectories in latent space and improve the agent performance. On the Crafter benchmark, EMERALD achieves new state-of-the-art performance, becoming the first method to surpass human experts performance within 10M environment steps. Our method also succeeds to unlock all 22 Crafter achievements at least once during evaluation.</description>

      <title>MMMOS: Multi-domain Multi-axis Audio Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate audio quality estimation is essential for developing and evaluating audio generation, retrieval, and enhancement systems. Existing non-intrusive assessment models predict a single Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for speech, merging diverse perceptual factors and failing to generalize beyond speech. We propose MMMOS, a no-reference, multi-domain audio quality assessment system that estimates four orthogonal axes: Production Quality, Production Complexity, Content Enjoyment, and Content Usefulness across speech, music, and environmental sounds. MMMOS fuses frame-level embeddings from three pretrained encoders (WavLM, MuQ, and M2D) and evaluates three aggregation strategies with four loss functions. By ensembling the top eight models, MMMOS shows a 20-30% reduction in mean squared error and a 4-5% increase in Kendall's {\tau} versus baseline, gains first place in six of eight Production Complexity metrics, and ranks among the top three on 17 of 32 challenge metrics.</description>

      <title>Human-centered AI with focus on Human-robot interaction (Book chapter)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern social robots can be considered the descendants of steam engines from the First Industrial Revolution (IR 1.0) and industrial robotic arms from the Third Industrial Revolution (IR 3.0). As some time has passed since the introduction of these robots during the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0), challenges and issues in their interaction with humans have emerged, leading researchers to conclude that, like any other AI-based technology, these robots must also be human-centered to meet the needs of their users. This chapter aims to introduce humans and their needs in interactions with robots, ranging from short-term, one-on-one interactions (micro-level) to long-term, macro-level needs at the societal scale. Building upon the principles of human-centered AI, this chapter presents, for the first time, a new framework of human needs called the Dual Pyramid. This framework encompasses a comprehensive list of human needs in robot interactions, from the most fundamental, robot effectiveness to macro level requirements, such as the collaboration with robots in achieving the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals.</description>

      <title>Conversation Forests: The Key to Fine Tuning Large Language Models for Multi-Turn Medical Conversations is Branching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated success in training large language models (LLMs) for single-turn tasks. However, these methods fall short in multi-turn applications, such as diagnostic patient interviewing, where understanding how early conversational turns influence downstream completions and outcomes is essential. In medicine, a multi-turn perspective is critical for learning diagnostic schemas and better understanding conversation dynamics. To address this gap, I introduce Savage Conversation Forests (SCF), a reinforcement learning framework that leverages a branched conversation architecture to fine-tune LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. SCF generates multiple possible conversation continuations at each turn, enabling the model to learn how different early responses affect downstream interactions and diagnostic outcomes. In experiments simulating doctor-patient conversations, SCF with branching outperforms linear conversation architectures on diagnostic accuracy. I hypothesize that SCF's improvements stem from its ability to provide richer, interdependent training signals across conversation turns. These results suggest that a branched training architecture is an important strategy for fine tuning LLMs in complex multi-turn conversational tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents HERO (Hierarchical Testing with Rabbit Optimization), a novel black-box adversarial testing framework for evaluating the robustness of deep learning-based Prognostics and Health Management systems in Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems. Leveraging Artificial Rabbit Optimization, HERO generates physically constrained adversarial examples that align with real-world data distributions via global and local perspective. Its generalizability ensures applicability across diverse ICPS scenarios. This study specifically focuses on the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell system, chosen for its highly dynamic operational conditions, complex degradation mechanisms, and increasing integration into ICPS as a sustainable and efficient energy solution. Experimental results highlight HERO's ability to uncover vulnerabilities in even state-of-the-art PHM models, underscoring the critical need for enhanced robustness in real-world applications. By addressing these challenges, HERO demonstrates its potential to advance more resilient PHM systems across a wide range of ICPS domains.</description>

      <title>Addressing The Devastating Effects Of Single-Task Data Poisoning In Exemplar-Free Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our research addresses the overlooked security concerns related to data poisoning in continual learning (CL). Data poisoning - the intentional manipulation of training data to affect the predictions of machine learning models - was recently shown to be a threat to CL training stability. While existing literature predominantly addresses scenario-dependent attacks, we propose to focus on a more simple and realistic single-task poison (STP) threats. In contrast to previously proposed poisoning settings, in STP adversaries lack knowledge and access to the model, as well as to both previous and future tasks. During an attack, they only have access to the current task within the data stream. Our study demonstrates that even within these stringent conditions, adversaries can compromise model performance using standard image corruptions. We show that STP attacks are able to strongly disrupt the whole continual training process: decreasing both the stability (its performance on past tasks) and plasticity (capacity to adapt to new tasks) of the algorithm. Finally, we propose a high-level defense framework for CL along with a poison task detection method based on task vectors. The code is available at https://github.com/stapaw/STP.git .</description>

      <title>When Data-Free Knowledge Distillation Meets Non-Transferable Teacher: Escaping Out-of-Distribution Trap is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a teacher to a student without access the real in-distribution (ID) data. Its common solution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a substitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers are trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted teachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation into distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the transferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is prohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's attention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This hinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To mitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit DFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically, inspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness on OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups according to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and used for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as OOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ATEsc for improving DFKD against NTL teachers. Code is released at https://github.com/tmllab/2025_ICML_ATEsc.</description>

      <title>Towards Accurate and Efficient 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Driving: A Mixture of Experts Computing System on Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Edge-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) Collaborative Computing (EMC2), an optimal computing system designed for autonomous vehicles (AVs) that simultaneously achieves low-latency and high-accuracy 3D object detection. Unlike conventional approaches, EMC2 incorporates a scenario-aware MoE architecture specifically optimized for edge platforms. By effectively fusing LiDAR and camera data, the system leverages the complementary strengths of sparse 3D point clouds and dense 2D images to generate robust multimodal representations. To enable this, EMC2 employs an adaptive multimodal data bridge that performs multi-scale preprocessing on sensor inputs, followed by a scenario-aware routing mechanism that dynamically dispatches features to dedicated expert models based on object visibility and distance. In addition, EMC2 integrates joint hardware-software optimizations, including hardware resource utilization optimization and computational graph simplification, to ensure efficient and real-time inference on resource-constrained edge devices. Experiments on open-source benchmarks clearly show the EMC2 advancements as a end-to-end system. On the KITTI dataset, it achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.58% and a 159.06% inference speedup compared to 15 baseline methods on Jetson platforms, with similar performance gains on the nuScenes dataset, highlighting its capability to advance reliable, real-time 3D object detection tasks for AVs.</description>

      <title>Driver-Net: Multi-Camera Fusion for Assessing Driver Take-Over Readiness in Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safe transition of control in automated vehicles requires an accurate and timely assessment of driver readiness. This paper introduces Driver-Net, a novel deep learning framework that fuses multi-camera inputs to estimate driver take-over readiness. Unlike conventional vision-based driver monitoring systems that focus on head pose or eye gaze, Driver-Net captures synchronised visual cues from the driver's head, hands, and body posture through a triple-camera setup. The model integrates spatio-temporal data using a dual-path architecture, comprising a Context Block and a Feature Block, followed by a cross-modal fusion strategy to enhance prediction accuracy. Evaluated on a diverse dataset collected from the University of Leeds Driving Simulator, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of up to 95.8% in driver readiness classification. This performance significantly enhances existing approaches and highlights the importance of multimodal and multi-view fusion. As a real-time, non-intrusive solution, Driver-Net contributes meaningfully to the development of safer and more reliable automated vehicles and aligns with new regulatory mandates and upcoming safety standards.</description>

      <title>Pedestrian Intention Prediction via Vision-Language Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prediction of pedestrian crossing intention is a critical function in autonomous vehicles. Conventional vision-based methods of crossing intention prediction often struggle with generalizability, context understanding, and causal reasoning. This study explores the potential of vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions by integrating multimodal data through hierarchical prompt templates. The methodology incorporates contextual information, including visual frames, physical cues observations, and ego-vehicle dynamics, into systematically refined prompts to guide VLFMs effectively in intention prediction. Experiments were conducted on three common datasets-JAAD, PIE, and FU-PIP. Results demonstrate that incorporating vehicle speed, its variations over time, and time-conscious prompts significantly enhances the prediction accuracy up to 19.8%. Additionally, optimised prompts generated via an automatic prompt engineering framework yielded 12.5% further accuracy gains. These findings highlight the superior performance of VLFMs compared to conventional vision-based models, offering enhanced generalisation and contextual understanding for autonomous driving applications.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Clinical Reasoning in Language Models: A Comparative Study of Prompts and Model Adaptation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the impact of prompting strategies and fine-tuning techniques on their reasoning capabilities. Yet, their effectiveness on clinical natural language inference (NLI) remains underexplored. This study presents the first controlled evaluation of how prompt structure and efficient fine-tuning jointly shape model performance in clinical NLI. We inspect four classes of prompting strategies to elicit reasoning in LLMs at different levels of abstraction, and evaluate their impact on a range of clinically motivated reasoning types. For each prompting strategy, we construct high-quality demonstrations using a frontier model to distil multi-step reasoning capabilities into smaller models (4B parameters) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Across different language models fine-tuned on the NLI4CT benchmark, we found that prompt type alone accounts for up to 44% of the variance in macro-F1. Moreover, LoRA fine-tuning yields consistent gains of +8 to 12 F1, raises output alignment above 97%, and narrows the performance gap to GPT-4o-mini to within 7.1%. Additional experiments on reasoning generalisation reveal that LoRA improves performance in 75% of the models on MedNLI and TREC Clinical Trials Track. Overall, these findings demonstrate that (i) prompt structure is a primary driver of clinical reasoning performance, (ii) compact models equipped with strong prompts and LoRA can rival frontier-scale systems, and (iii) reasoning-type-aware evaluation is essential to uncover prompt-induced trade-offs. Our results highlight the promise of combining prompt design and lightweight adaptation for more efficient and trustworthy clinical NLP systems, providing insights on the strengths and limitations of widely adopted prompting and parameter-efficient techniques in highly specialised domains.</description>

Abstract: We propose a non-autoregressive framework for the Travelling Salesman Problem where solutions emerge directly from learned permutations without explicit search. By applying a similarity transformation to Hamiltonian cycles, the model learns to approximate permutation matrices via continuous relaxations. Our unsupervised approach achieves competitive performance against classical heuristics, demonstrating that the inherent structure of the problem can effectively guide combinatorial optimization without sequential decision-making.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification in the Tsetlin Machine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data modeling using Tsetlin machines (TMs) is all about building logical rules from the data features. The decisions of the model are based on a combination of these logical rules. Hence, the model is fully transparent and it is possible to get explanations of its predictions. In this paper, we present a probability score for TM predictions and develop new techniques for uncertainty quantification to increase the explainability further. The probability score is an inherent property of any TM variant and is derived through an analysis of the TM learning dynamics. Simulated data is used to show a clear connection between the learned TM probability scores and the underlying probabilities of the data. A visualization of the probability scores also reveals that the TM is less confident in its predictions outside the training data domain, which contrasts the typical extrapolation phenomenon found in Artificial Neural Networks. The paper concludes with an application of the uncertainty quantification techniques on an image classification task using the CIFAR-10 dataset, where they provide new insights and suggest possible improvements to current TM image classification models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding character relationships is essential for interpreting complex narratives and conducting socially grounded AI research. However, manual annotation is time-consuming and low in coverage, while large language models (LLMs) often produce hallucinated or logically inconsistent outputs. We present SymbolicThought, a human-in-the-loop framework that combines LLM-based extraction with symbolic reasoning. The system constructs editable character relationship graphs, refines them using seven types of logical constraints, and enables real-time validation and conflict resolution through an interactive interface. To support logical supervision and explainable social analysis, we release a dataset of 160 interpersonal relationships with corresponding logical structures. Experiments show that SymbolicThought improves annotation accuracy and consistency while significantly reducing time cost, offering a practical tool for narrative understanding, explainable AI, and LLM evaluation.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Sample SGD: an End-to-end Analysis of Supervised Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical works on supervised transfer learning (STL) -- where the learner has access to labeled samples from both source and target distributions -- have for the most part focused on statistical aspects of the problem, while efficient optimization has received less attention. We consider the problem of designing an SGD procedure for STL that alternates sampling between source and target data, while maintaining statistical transfer guarantees without prior knowledge of the quality of the source data. A main algorithmic difficulty is in understanding how to design such an adaptive sub-sampling mechanism at each SGD step, to automatically gain from the source when it is informative, or bias towards the target and avoid negative transfer when the source is less informative.
  We show that, such a mixed-sample SGD procedure is feasible for general prediction tasks with convex losses, rooted in tracking an abstract sequence of constrained convex programs that serve to maintain the desired transfer guarantees.
  We instantiate these results in the concrete setting of linear regression with square loss, and show that the procedure converges, with $1/\sqrt{T}$ rate, to a solution whose statistical performance on the target is adaptive to the a priori unknown quality of the source. Experiments with synthetic and real datasets support the theory.</description>

      <title>Model Collapse Is Not a Bug but a Feature in Machine Unlearning for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current unlearning methods for LLMs optimize on the private information they seek to remove by incorporating it into their training objectives. We argue this not only risks reinforcing exposure to sensitive data, it also fundamentally contradicts the principle of minimizing its use. As a remedy, we propose a novel unlearning method - Partial Model Collapse (PMC), which does not require unlearning targets in the unlearning objective. Our approach is inspired by recent observations that training generative models on their own generations leads to distribution collapse, effectively removing information from the model. Our core idea is to leverage this collapse for unlearning by triggering collapse partially on the sensitive data. We theoretically analyze that our approach converges to the desired outcome, i.e. the LLM unlearns the information in the forget set. We empirically demonstrate that PMC overcomes two key limitations of existing unlearning approaches that explicitly optimize on unlearning targets, and more effectively removes private information from model outputs. Overall, our contributions represent an important step toward more comprehensive unlearning that aligns with real-world privacy constraints.

      <title>Context Tuning for In-Context Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Context Tuning, a simple and effective method to significantly enhance few-shot adaptation of language models (LLMs) without fine-tuning model parameters. While prompt-based adaptation techniques have demonstrated the effectiveness of lightweight adaptation methods for large language models (LLMs), they typically initialize a trainable prompt or prefix with irrelevant tokens for the task at hand. In contrast, Context Tuning initializes the trainable prompt or prefix with task-specific demonstration examples, leveraging the model's inherent In-Context Learning (ICL) ability to extract relevant information for improved few-shot learning performance. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks such as CrossFit, UnifiedQA, MMLU, BIG-Bench Hard, and ARC demonstrate that Context Tuning outperforms traditional prompt-based adaptation methods and achieves competitive accuracy to Test-Time Training with significantly higher training efficiency.</description>

      <title>Fairness Evaluation of Large Language Models in Academic Library Reference Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As libraries explore large language models (LLMs) for use in virtual reference services, a key question arises: Can LLMs serve all users equitably, regardless of demographics or social status? While they offer great potential for scalable support, LLMs may also reproduce societal biases embedded in their training data, risking the integrity of libraries' commitment to equitable service. To address this concern, we evaluate whether LLMs differentiate responses across user identities by prompting six state-of-the-art LLMs to assist patrons differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and institutional role. We found no evidence of differentiation by race or ethnicity, and only minor evidence of stereotypical bias against women in one model. LLMs demonstrated nuanced accommodation of institutional roles through the use of linguistic choices related to formality, politeness, and domain-specific vocabularies, reflecting professional norms rather than discriminatory treatment. These findings suggest that current LLMs show a promising degree of readiness to support equitable and contextually appropriate communication in academic library reference services.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Cyclic Peptide Design with Composable Geometric Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyclic peptides, characterized by geometric constraints absent in linear peptides, offer enhanced biochemical properties, presenting new opportunities to address unmet medical needs. However, designing target-specific cyclic peptides remains underexplored due to limited training data. To bridge the gap, we propose CP-Composer, a novel generative framework that enables zero-shot cyclic peptide generation via composable geometric constraints. Our approach decomposes complex cyclization patterns into unit constraints, which are incorporated into a diffusion model through geometric conditioning on nodes and edges. During training, the model learns from unit constraints and their random combinations in linear peptides, while at inference, novel constraint combinations required for cyclization are imposed as input. Experiments show that our model, despite trained with linear peptides, is capable of generating diverse target-binding cyclic peptides, reaching success rates from 38% to 84% on different cyclization strategies.</description>

      <title>Hijacking JARVIS: Benchmarking Mobile GUI Agents against Unprivileged Third Parties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile GUI agents are designed to autonomously execute diverse device-control tasks by interpreting and interacting with mobile screens. Despite notable advancements, their resilience in real-world scenarios where screen content may be partially manipulated by untrustworthy third parties remains largely unexplored. Owing to their black-box and autonomous nature, these agents are vulnerable to manipulations that could compromise user devices. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the vulnerabilities of mobile GUI agents. We introduce a scalable attack simulation framework AgentHazard, which enables flexible and targeted modifications of screen content within existing applications. Leveraging this framework, we develop a comprehensive benchmark suite comprising both a dynamic task execution environment and a static dataset of vision-language-action tuples, totaling over 3,000 attack scenarios. The dynamic environment encompasses 58 reproducible tasks in an emulator with various types of hazardous UI content, while the static dataset is constructed from 210 screenshots collected from 14 popular commercial apps. Importantly, our content modifications are designed to be feasible for unprivileged third parties. We evaluate 7 widely-used mobile GUI agents and 5 common backbone models using our benchmark. Our findings reveal that all examined agents are significantly influenced by misleading third-party content (with an average misleading rate of 28.8% in human-crafted attack scenarios) and that their vulnerabilities are closely linked to the employed perception modalities and backbone LLMs. Furthermore, we assess training-based mitigation strategies, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities for enhancing the robustness of mobile GUI agents. Our code and data will be released at https://agenthazard.github.io.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Sustain Pedal Depth Estimation from Piano Audio Across Room Acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piano sustain pedal detection has previously been approached as a binary on/off classification task, limiting its application in real-world piano performance scenarios where pedal depth significantly influences musical expression. This paper presents a novel approach for high-resolution estimation that predicts continuous pedal depth values. We introduce a Transformer-based architecture that not only matches state-of-the-art performance on the traditional binary classification task but also achieves high accuracy in continuous pedal depth estimation. Furthermore, by estimating continuous values, our model provides musically meaningful predictions for sustain pedal usage, whereas baseline models struggle to capture such nuanced expressions with their binary detection approach. Additionally, this paper investigates the influence of room acoustics on sustain pedal estimation using a synthetic dataset that includes varied acoustic conditions. We train our model with different combinations of room settings and test it in an unseen new environment using a "leave-one-out" approach. Our findings show that the two baseline models and ours are not robust to unseen room conditions. Statistical analysis further confirms that reverberation influences model predictions and introduces an overestimation bias.</description>

      <title>Design Optimization of Three-Dimensional Wire Arrangement Considering Wire Crossings for Tendon-driven Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tendon-driven mechanisms are useful from the perspectives of variable stiffness, redundant actuation, and lightweight design, and they are widely used, particularly in hands, wrists, and waists of robots. The design of these wire arrangements has traditionally been done empirically, but it becomes extremely challenging when dealing with complex structures. Various studies have attempted to optimize wire arrangement, but many of them have oversimplified the problem by imposing conditions such as restricting movements to a 2D plane, keeping the moment arm constant, or neglecting wire crossings. Therefore, this study proposes a three-dimensional wire arrangement optimization that takes wire crossings into account. We explore wire arrangements through a multi-objective black-box optimization method that ensures wires do not cross while providing sufficient joint torque along a defined target trajectory. For a 3D link structure, we optimize the wire arrangement under various conditions, demonstrate its effectiveness, and discuss the obtained design solutions.</description>

      <title>Scaling Context Requires Rethinking Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that neither transformers nor sub-quadratic architectures are well suited to training at long sequence lengths: the cost of processing the context is too expensive in the former, too inexpensive in the latter. Approaches such as sliding window attention which reduce the cost-per-token of a transformer impair in-context learning, and so are also unsuitable. To address these limitations, we introduce power attention, an architectural layer for linear-cost sequence modeling whose state size can be adjusted independently of parameters, unlocking the advantages of linear attention on practical domains. We develop and open-source a set of GPU kernels for efficient power attention, identifying a novel pattern of operation fusion to avoid memory and bandwidth bottlenecks. Our experiments on the in-context learning of power attention shows that these models dominate both exponential attention and linear attention at long-context training.</description>

      <title>Domain Generalizable Portrait Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04243v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a portrait style transfer method that generalizes well to various different domains while enabling high-quality semantic-aligned stylization on regions including hair, eyes, eyelashes, skins, lips, and background. To this end, we propose to establish dense semantic correspondence between the given input and reference portraits based on a pre-trained model and a semantic adapter, with which we obtain a warped reference semantically aligned with the input. To ensure effective yet controllable style transfer, we devise an AdaIN-Wavelet transform to balance content preservation and stylization by blending low-frequency information of the warped reference with high-frequency information of the input in the latent space. A style adapter is also designed to provide style guidance from the warped reference. With the stylized latent from AdaIN-Wavelet transform, we employ a dual-conditional diffusion model that integrates a ControlNet recording high-frequency information and the style guidance to generate the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code and trained model are available at https://github.com/wangxb29/DGPST.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety alignment is crucial for large language models (LLMs) to resist malicious instructions but often results in over-refusals, where benign prompts are unnecessarily rejected, impairing user experience and model utility. We introduce ACTOR (Activation-Based Training for Over-Refusal Reduction), a robust and compute- and data-efficient training framework that minimizes over-refusals by leveraging internal activation patterns from diverse queries. ACTOR precisely identifies and adjusts the activation components that trigger refusals, providing stronger control over the refusal mechanism. By fine-tuning only a single model layer, ACTOR effectively reduces over-refusals across multiple benchmarks while maintaining the model's ability to handle harmful queries and preserve overall utility.</description>

Abstract: COVID-19 is a severe and acute viral disease that can cause symptoms consistent with pneumonia in which inflammation is caused in the alveolous regions of the lungs leading to a build-up of fluid and breathing difficulties. Thus, the diagnosis of COVID using CT scans has been effective in assisting with RT-PCR diagnosis and severity classifications. In this paper, we proposed a new data quality control pipeline to refine the quality of CT images based on GAN and sliding windows. Also, we use class-sensitive cost functions including Label Distribution Aware Loss(LDAM Loss) and Class-balanced(CB) Loss to solve the long-tail problem existing in datasets. Our model reaches more than 0.983 MCC in the benchmark test dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to the emergence of foundation models, large-scale pre-trained neural networks that serve as versatile starting points for a wide range of downstream tasks. In this work, we present ZERO, a zero-shot multi-prompt object detection model specifically designed for robust, production-ready deployment across diverse industrial domains. ZERO integrates direct image input with multiple user-defined prompts, which can include both textual and visual cues, and processes them through dedicated encoders to generate accurate detection outputs. The model architecture is optimized for scalability, with a total of 1.033 TFLOPS and 622.346 million parameters, and is trained using a domain-specific image database exceeding one billion images. For the CVPR 2025 Foundational Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) Challenge, we introduce a domain-specific fine-tuning strategy that emphasizes prompt diversity and conservative pseudo-labeling, enabling effective adaptation to new domains with minimal supervision. Our approach demonstrates practical advantages in flexibility, efficiency, and real-world applicability, achieving strong performance on the RF20VL-fsod benchmark despite limited annotation budgets. The results highlight the potential of prompt-driven, data-centric AI for scalable and adaptive object detection in dynamic industrial environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The persistent threat of Android malware presents a serious challenge to the security of millions of users globally. While many machine learning-based methods have been developed to detect these threats, their reliance on large labeled datasets limits their effectiveness against emerging, previously unseen malware families, for which labeled data is scarce or nonexistent.
  To address this challenge, we introduce a novel zero-shot learning framework that combines Variational Graph Auto-Encoders (VGAE) with Siamese Neural Networks (SNN) to identify malware without needing prior examples of specific malware families. Our approach leverages graph-based representations of Android applications, enabling the model to detect subtle structural differences between benign and malicious software, even in the absence of labeled data for new threats.
  Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art MaMaDroid, especially in zero-day malware detection. Our model achieves 96.24% accuracy and 95.20% recall for unknown malware families, highlighting its robustness against evolving Android threats.</description>

      <title>SeqTex: Generate Mesh Textures in Video Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training native 3D texture generative models remains a fundamental yet challenging problem, largely due to the limited availability of large-scale, high-quality 3D texture datasets. This scarcity hinders generalization to real-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune foundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors. However, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on post-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in modern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error accumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper, we introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual knowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate complete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution of UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence generation problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of multi-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the consistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain. To further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a decoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide cross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine texture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these components allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize high-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing. Extensive experiments show that SeqTex achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image-conditioned and text-conditioned 3D texture generation tasks, with superior 3D consistency, texture-geometry alignment, and real-world generalization.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) in multi-modal understanding, there is increasing potential for video comprehension technologies to support professional domains such as medical education. However, existing benchmarks suffer from two primary limitations: (1) Linguistic Singularity: they are largely confined to English, neglecting the need for multilingual resources; and (2) Shallow Reasoning: their questions are often designed for surface-level information retrieval, failing to properly assess deep multi-modal integration. To address these limitations, we present M3-Med, the first benchmark for Multi-lingual, Multi-modal, and Multi-hop reasoning in Medical instructional video understanding. M3-Med consists of medical questions paired with corresponding video segments, annotated by a team of medical experts. A key innovation of M3-Med is its multi-hop reasoning task, which requires a model to first locate a key entity in the text, then find corresponding visual evidence in the video, and finally synthesize information across both modalities to derive the answer. This design moves beyond simple text matching and poses a substantial challenge to a model's deep cross-modal understanding capabilities. We define two tasks: Temporal Answer Grounding in Single Video (TAGSV) and Temporal Answer Grounding in Video Corpus (TAGVC). We evaluated several state-of-the-art models and Large Language Models (LLMs) on M3-Med. The results reveal a significant performance gap between all models and human experts, especially on the complex multi-hop questions where model performance drops sharply. M3-Med effectively highlights the current limitations of AI models in deep cross-modal reasoning within specialized domains and provides a new direction for future research.</description>

      <title>LearnLens: LLM-Enabled Personalised, Curriculum-Grounded Feedback with Educators in the Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective feedback is essential for student learning but is time-intensive for teachers. We present LearnLens, a modular, LLM-based system that generates personalised, curriculum-aligned feedback in science education. LearnLens comprises three components: (1) an error-aware assessment module that captures nuanced reasoning errors; (2) a curriculum-grounded generation module that uses a structured, topic-linked memory chain rather than traditional similarity-based retrieval, improving relevance and reducing noise; and (3) an educator-in-the-loop interface for customisation and oversight. LearnLens addresses key challenges in existing systems, offering scalable, high-quality feedback that empowers both teachers and students.</description>

      <title>QF: Quick Feedforward AI Model Training without Gradient Back Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Quick Feedforward (QF) Learning, a novel knowledge consolidation framework for transformer-based models that enables efficient transfer of instruction derived knowledge into model weights through feedforward activations without any gradient back propagation. Unlike traditional finetuning, QF updates are computed in closed form, require minimal parameter modification, and preserve prior knowledge. Importantly, QF allows models to train and infer within the same runtime environment, making the process more resource efficient and closely aligned with how the human brain operates. Code and models are open sourced on GitHub. I hope QF Learning inspires a more efficient and brain-like paradigm for AI systems.</description>

      <title>Surg-SegFormer: A Dual Transformer-Based Model for Holistic Surgical Scene Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holistic surgical scene segmentation in robot-assisted surgery (RAS) enables surgical residents to identify various anatomical tissues, articulated tools, and critical structures, such as veins and vessels. Given the firm intraoperative time constraints, it is challenging for surgeons to provide detailed real-time explanations of the operative field for trainees. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity of expert surgeons relative to trainees, making the unambiguous delineation of go- and no-go zones inconvenient. Therefore, high-performance semantic segmentation models offer a solution by providing clear postoperative analyses of surgical procedures. However, recent advanced segmentation models rely on user-generated prompts, rendering them impractical for lengthy surgical videos that commonly exceed an hour. To address this challenge, we introduce Surg-SegFormer, a novel prompt-free model that outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques. Surg-SegFormer attained a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.80 on the EndoVis2018 dataset and 0.54 on the EndoVis2017 dataset. By providing robust and automated surgical scene comprehension, this model significantly reduces the tutoring burden on expert surgeons, empowering residents to independently and effectively understand complex surgical environments.</description>

      <title>CLIP-RL: Surgical Scene Segmentation Using Contrastive Language-Vision Pretraining &amp; Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding surgical scenes can provide better healthcare quality for patients, especially with the vast amount of video data that is generated during MIS. Processing these videos generates valuable assets for training sophisticated models. In this paper, we introduce CLIP-RL, a novel contrastive language-image pre-training model tailored for semantic segmentation for surgical scenes. CLIP-RL presents a new segmentation approach which involves reinforcement learning and curriculum learning, enabling continuous refinement of the segmentation masks during the full training pipeline. Our model has shown robust performance in different optical settings, such as occlusions, texture variations, and dynamic lighting, presenting significant challenges. CLIP model serves as a powerful feature extractor, capturing rich semantic context that enhances the distinction between instruments and tissues. The RL module plays a pivotal role in dynamically refining predictions through iterative action-space adjustments. We evaluated CLIP-RL on the EndoVis 2018 and EndoVis 2017 datasets. CLIP-RL achieved a mean IoU of 81%, outperforming state-of-the-art models, and a mean IoU of 74.12% on EndoVis 2017. This superior performance was achieved due to the combination of contrastive learning with reinforcement learning and curriculum learning.</description>

      <title>Efficient Perplexity Bound and Ratio Matching in Discrete Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While continuous diffusion models excel in modeling continuous distributions, their application to categorical data has been less effective. Recent work has shown that ratio-matching through score-entropy within a continuous-time discrete Markov chain (CTMC) framework serves as a competitive alternative to autoregressive models in language modeling. To enhance this framework, we first introduce three new theorems concerning the KL divergence between the data and learned distribution. Our results serve as the discrete counterpart to those established for continuous diffusion models and allow us to derive an improved upper bound of the perplexity. Second, we empirically show that ratio-matching performed by minimizing the denoising cross-entropy between the clean and corrupted data enables models to outperform those utilizing score-entropy with up to 10% lower perplexity/generative-perplexity, and 15% faster training steps. To further support our findings, we introduce and evaluate a novel CTMC transition-rate matrix that allows prediction refinement, and derive the analytic expression for its matrix exponential which facilitates the computation of conditional ratios thus enabling efficient training and generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to improve the action smoothness of a cascaded online learning flight control system. Although the cascaded structure is widely used in flight control design, its stability can be compromised by oscillatory control actions, which poses challenges for practical engineering applications. To address this issue, we introduce an online temporal smoothness technique and a low-pass filter to reduce the amplitude and frequency of the control actions. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to analyze policy performance in the frequency domain. Simulation results demonstrate the improvements achieved by the two proposed techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Choosing the right fabric is crucial to meet functional and quality requirements in robotic applications for textile manufacturing, apparel production, and smart retail. We present MLLM-Fabric, a robotic framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for fabric sorting and selection. The system includes a robotic arm, a camera, a visuotactile sensor, and a pressure sensor. It employs supervised fine-tuning and multimodal explanation-guided knowledge distillation to accurately classify and rank fabric properties. To facilitate further research, we release a dataset of 220 unique fabric samples, including RGB images and synchronized visuotactile and pressure data. Experimental results show that our Fabric-Llama-90B model consistently outperforms pretrained vision-language baselines in both property ranking accuracy and selection reliability.</description>

      <title>AI-washing: The Asymmetric Effects of Its Two Types on Consumer Moral Judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI hype continues to grow, organizations face pressure to broadcast or downplay purported AI initiatives - even when contrary to truth. This paper introduces AI-washing as overstating (deceptive boasting) or understating (deceptive denial) a company's real AI usage. A 2x2 experiment (N = 401) examines how these false claims affect consumer attitudes and purchase intentions. Results reveal a pronounced asymmetry: deceptive denial evokes more negative moral judgments than honest negation, while deceptive boasting has no effects. We show that perceived betrayal mediates these outcomes. By clarifying how AI-washing erodes trust, the study highlights clear ethical implications for policymakers, marketers, and researchers striving for transparency.</description>

      <title>Mission-Aligned Learning-Informed Control of Autonomous Systems: Formulation and Foundations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research, innovation and practical capital investment have been increasing rapidly toward the realization of autonomous physical agents. This includes industrial and service robots, unmanned aerial vehicles, embedded control devices, and a number of other realizations of cybernetic/mechatronic implementations of intelligent autonomous devices. In this paper, we consider a stylized version of robotic care, which would normally involve a two-level Reinforcement Learning procedure that trains a policy for both lower level physical movement decisions as well as higher level conceptual tasks and their sub-components. In order to deliver greater safety and reliability in the system, we present the general formulation of this as a two-level optimization scheme which incorporates control at the lower level, and classical planning at the higher level, integrated with a capacity for learning. This synergistic integration of multiple methodologies -- control, classical planning, and RL -- presents an opportunity for greater insight for algorithm development, leading to more efficient and reliable performance. Here, the notion of reliability pertains to physical safety and interpretability into an otherwise black box operation of autonomous agents, concerning users and regulators. This work presents the necessary background and general formulation of the optimization framework, detailing each component and its integration with the others.</description>

      <title>Attention Slipping: A Mechanistic Understanding of Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integral to society and technology, ensuring their safety becomes essential. Jailbreak attacks exploit vulnerabilities to bypass safety guardrails, posing a significant threat. However, the mechanisms enabling these attacks are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal a universal phenomenon that occurs during jailbreak attacks: Attention Slipping. During this phenomenon, the model gradually reduces the attention it allocates to unsafe requests in a user query during the attack process, ultimately causing a jailbreak. We show Attention Slipping is consistent across various jailbreak methods, including gradient-based token replacement, prompt-level template refinement, and in-context learning. Additionally, we evaluate two defenses based on query perturbation, Token Highlighter and SmoothLLM, and find they indirectly mitigate Attention Slipping, with their effectiveness positively correlated with the degree of mitigation achieved. Inspired by this finding, we propose Attention Sharpening, a new defense that directly counters Attention Slipping by sharpening the attention score distribution using temperature scaling. Experiments on four leading LLMs (Gemma2-9B-It, Llama3.1-8B-It, Qwen2.5-7B-It, Mistral-7B-It v0.2) show that our method effectively resists various jailbreak attacks while maintaining performance on benign tasks on AlpacaEval. Importantly, Attention Sharpening introduces no additional computational or memory overhead, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Transferring Visual Explainability of Self-Explaining Models through Task Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In scenarios requiring both prediction and explanation efficiency for image classification, self-explaining models that perform both tasks in a single inference are effective. However, their training incurs substantial labeling and computational costs. This study aims to tackle the issue by proposing a method to transfer the visual explainability of self-explaining models, learned in a source domain, to a target domain based on a task arithmetic framework. Specifically, we construct a self-explaining model by extending image classifiers based on a vision-language pretrained model. We then define an \emph{explainability vector} as the difference between model parameters trained on the source domain with and without explanation supervision. Based on the task arithmetic framework, we impart explainability to a model trained only on the prediction task in the target domain by applying the explainability vector. Experimental results on various image classification datasets demonstrate that, except for transfers between some less-related domains, visual explainability can be successfully transferred from source to target domains, improving explanation quality in the target domain without sacrificing classification accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the explainability vector learned on a large and diverse dataset like ImageNet, extended with explanation supervision, exhibits universality and robustness, improving explanation quality on nine out of ten different target datasets. We also find that the explanation quality achieved with a single model inference is comparable to that of Kernel SHAP, which requires 150 model inferences.</description>

      <title>Tractable Representation Learning with Probabilistic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are powerful probabilistic models that enable exact and tractable inference, making them highly suitable for probabilistic reasoning and inference tasks. While dominant in neural networks, representation learning with PCs remains underexplored, with prior approaches relying on external neural embeddings or activation-based encodings. To address this gap, we introduce autoencoding probabilistic circuits (APCs), a novel framework leveraging the tractability of PCs to model probabilistic embeddings explicitly. APCs extend PCs by jointly modeling data and embeddings, obtaining embedding representations through tractable probabilistic inference. The PC encoder allows the framework to natively handle arbitrary missing data and is seamlessly integrated with a neural decoder in a hybrid, end-to-end trainable architecture enabled by differentiable sampling. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that APCs outperform existing PC-based autoencoding methods in reconstruction quality, generate embeddings competitive with, and exhibit superior robustness in handling missing data compared to neural autoencoders. These results highlight APCs as a powerful and flexible representation learning method that exploits the probabilistic inference capabilities of PCs, showing promising directions for robust inference, out-of-distribution detection, and knowledge distillation.</description>

      <title>SpiritRAG: A Q&amp;A System for Religion and Spirituality in the United Nations Archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Religion and spirituality (R/S) are complex and highly domain-dependent concepts which have long confounded researchers and policymakers. Due to their context-specificity, R/S are difficult to operationalize in conventional archival search strategies, particularly when datasets are very large, poorly accessible, and marked by information noise. As a result, considerable time investments and specialist knowledge is often needed to extract actionable insights related to R/S from general archival sources, increasing reliance on published literature and manual desk reviews. To address this challenge, we present SpiritRAG, an interactive Question Answering (Q&amp;A) system based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Built using 7,500 United Nations (UN) resolution documents related to R/S in the domains of health and education, SpiritRAG allows researchers and policymakers to conduct complex, context-sensitive database searches of very large datasets using an easily accessible, chat-based web interface. SpiritRAG is lightweight to deploy and leverages both UN documents and user provided documents as source material. A pilot test and evaluation with domain experts on 100 manually composed questions demonstrates the practical value and usefulness of SpiritRAG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents our submission to the ACMMM25 - Grand Challenge on Multimedia Verification. We developed a multi-agent verification system that combines Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with specialized verification tools to detect multimedia misinformation. Our system operates through six stages: raw data processing, planning, information extraction, deep research, evidence collection, and report generation. The core Deep Researcher Agent employs four tools: reverse image search, metadata analysis, fact-checking databases, and verified news processing that extracts spatial, temporal, attribution, and motivational context. We demonstrate our approach on a challenge dataset sample involving complex multimedia content. Our system successfully verified content authenticity, extracted precise geolocation and timing information, and traced source attribution across multiple platforms, effectively addressing real-world multimedia verification scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advancement of artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), has significantly impacted software engineering research, including bug report analysis. ML aims to automate the understanding, extraction, and correlation of information from bug reports. Despite its growing importance, there has been no comprehensive review in this area. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review covering 1,825 papers, selecting 204 for detailed analysis. We derive seven key findings: 1) Extensive use of CNN, LSTM, and $k$NN for bug report analysis, with advanced models like BERT underutilized due to their complexity. 2) Word2Vec and TF-IDF are popular for feature representation, with a rise in deep learning approaches. 3) Stop word removal is the most common preprocessing, with structural methods rising after 2020. 4) Eclipse and Mozilla are the most frequently evaluated software projects. 5) Bug categorization is the most common task, followed by bug localization and severity prediction. 6) There is increasing attention on specific bugs like non-functional and performance bugs. 7) Common evaluation metrics are F1-score, Recall, Precision, and Accuracy, with $k$-fold cross-validation preferred for model evaluation. 8) Many studies lack robust statistical tests. We also identify six promising future research directions to provide useful insights for practitioners.</description>

      <title>The Joys of Categorical Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is an Uncertainty Representation technique that delivers finite-sample calibrated prediction regions for any underlying Machine Learning model, yet its status as an Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) tool has remained conceptually opaque. We adopt a category-theoretic approach to CP -- framing it as a morphism, embedded in a commuting diagram, of two newly-defined categories -- that brings us three joys. First, we show that -- under minimal assumptions -- CP is intrinsically a UQ mechanism, that is, its UQ capabilities are a structural feature of the method. Second, we demonstrate that CP bridges (and perhaps subsumes) the Bayesian, frequentist, and imprecise probabilistic approaches to predictive statistical reasoning. Finally, we show that a conformal prediction region (CPR) is the image of a covariant functor. This observation is relevant to AI privacy: It implies that privacy noise added locally does not break coverage.</description>

      <title>The role of large language models in UI/UX design: A systematic literature review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This systematic literature review examines the role of large language models (LLMs) in UI/UX design, synthesizing findings from 38 peer-reviewed studies published between 2022 and 2025. We identify key LLMs in use, including GPT-4, Gemini, and PaLM, and map their integration across the design lifecycle, from ideation to evaluation. Common practices include prompt engineering, human-in-the-loop workflows, and multimodal input. While LLMs are reshaping design processes, challenges such as hallucination, prompt instability, and limited explainability persist. Our findings highlight LLMs as emerging collaborators in design, and we propose directions for the ethical, inclusive, and effective integration of these technologies.</description>

      <title>Model Inversion Attacks on Llama 3: Extracting PII from Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, but their ability to memorize training data poses significant privacy risks. This paper investigates model inversion attacks on the Llama 3.2 model, a multilingual LLM developed by Meta. By querying the model with carefully crafted prompts, we demonstrate the extraction of personally identifiable information (PII) such as passwords, email addresses, and account numbers. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of even smaller LLMs to privacy attacks and underscore the need for robust defenses. We discuss potential mitigation strategies, including differential privacy and data sanitization, and call for further research into privacy-preserving machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Source Attribution in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While attribution methods, such as Shapley values, are widely used to explain the importance of features or training data in traditional machine learning, their application to Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly within Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, is nascent and challenging. The primary obstacle is the substantial computational cost, where each utility function evaluation involves an expensive LLM call, resulting in direct monetary and time expenses. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of adapting Shapley-based attribution to identify influential retrieved documents in RAG. We compare Shapley with more computationally tractable approximations and some existing attribution methods for LLM. Our work aims to: (1) systematically apply established attribution principles to the RAG document-level setting; (2) quantify how well SHAP approximations can mirror exact attributions while minimizing costly LLM interactions; and (3) evaluate their practical explainability in identifying critical documents, especially under complex inter-document relationships such as redundancy, complementarity, and synergy. This study seeks to bridge the gap between powerful attribution techniques and the practical constraints of LLM-based RAG systems, offering insights into achieving reliable and affordable RAG explainability.</description>

      <title>LoSiA: Efficient High-Rank Fine-Tuning via Subnet Localization and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04487v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters by introducing low-rank decomposition matrices. However, existing methods perform extensive matrix multiplications in domain specialization tasks, resulting in computational inefficiency and sub-optimal fine-tuning performance. Hence, we propose LoSiA(Low-Resources Subnet Integration Adaptation), an innovative method that dynamically localizes and optimizes critical parameters during the training process. Specifically, it identifies a sub-network using gradient sparsity analysis and optimizes it as the trainable target. This design enables effective high-rank adaptation by updating only the sub-network parameters, reducing the additional matrix multiplication. We also present LoSiA-Pro, a faster implementation of LoSiA, which reduces the training latency by about $27\%$ compared to LoRA. Extensive evaluations show that our method achieves minimal performance drop compared to full fine-tuning, while requiring the least training time across domain specialization and common-sense reasoning tasks. Further analysis shows that LoSiA also reduces forgetting during continued training.</description>

      <title>Dealing with Uncertainty in Contextual Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextual anomaly detection (CAD) aims to identify anomalies in a target (behavioral) variable conditioned on a set of contextual variables that influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves indicators of anomaly. In many anomaly detection tasks, there exist contextual variables that influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves indicators of anomaly. In this work, we propose a novel framework for CAD, normalcy score (NS), that explicitly models both the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Built on heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression, our method regards the Z-score as a random variable, providing confidence intervals that reflect the reliability of the anomaly assessment. Through experiments on benchmark datasets and a real-world application in cardiology, we demonstrate that NS outperforms state-of-the-art CAD methods in both detection accuracy and interpretability. Moreover, confidence intervals enable an adaptive, uncertainty-driven decision-making process, which may be very important in domains such as healthcare.</description>

      <title>A validity-guided workflow for robust large language model research in psychology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into psychological research as research tools, evaluation targets, human simulators, and cognitive models. However, recent evidence reveals severe measurement unreliability: Personality assessments collapse under factor analysis, moral preferences reverse with punctuation changes, and theory-of-mind accuracy varies widely with trivial rephrasing. These "measurement phantoms"--statistical artifacts masquerading as psychological phenomena--threaten the validity of a growing body of research. Guided by the dual-validity framework that integrates psychometrics with causal inference, we present a six-stage workflow that scales validity requirements to research ambition--using LLMs to code text requires basic reliability and accuracy, while claims about psychological properties demand comprehensive construct validation. Researchers must (1) explicitly define their research goal and corresponding validity requirements, (2) develop and validate computational instruments through psychometric testing, (3) design experiments that control for computational confounds, (4) execute protocols with transparency, (5) analyze data using methods appropriate for non-independent observations, and (6) report findings within demonstrated boundaries and use results to refine theory. We illustrate the workflow through an example of model evaluation--"LLM selfhood"--showing how systematic validation can distinguish genuine computational phenomena from measurement artifacts. By establishing validated computational instruments and transparent practices, this workflow provides a path toward building a robust empirical foundation for AI psychology research.</description>

      <title>MVL-Loc: Leveraging Vision-Language Model for Generalizable Multi-Scene Camera Relocalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Camera relocalization, a cornerstone capability of modern computer vision, accurately determines a camera's position and orientation (6-DoF) from images and is essential for applications in augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), autonomous driving, delivery drones, and robotic navigation. Unlike traditional deep learning-based methods that regress camera pose from images in a single scene, which often lack generalization and robustness in diverse environments, we propose MVL-Loc, a novel end-to-end multi-scene 6-DoF camera relocalization framework. MVL-Loc leverages pretrained world knowledge from vision-language models (VLMs) and incorporates multimodal data to generalize across both indoor and outdoor settings. Furthermore, natural language is employed as a directive tool to guide the multi-scene learning process, facilitating semantic understanding of complex scenes and capturing spatial relationships among objects. Extensive experiments on the 7Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets demonstrate MVL-Loc's robustness and state-of-the-art performance in real-world multi-scene camera relocalization, with improved accuracy in both positional and orientational estimates.</description>

      <title>Grounded Gesture Generation: Language, Motion, and Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human motion generation has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet the critical problem of creating spatially grounded, context-aware gestures has been largely overlooked. Existing models typically specialize either in descriptive motion generation, such as locomotion and object interaction, or in isolated co-speech gesture synthesis aligned with utterance semantics. However, both lines of work often treat motion and environmental grounding separately, limiting advances toward embodied, communicative agents. To address this gap, our work introduces a multimodal dataset and framework for grounded gesture generation, combining two key resources: (1) a synthetic dataset of spatially grounded referential gestures, and (2) MM-Conv, a VR-based dataset capturing two-party dialogues. Together, they provide over 7.7 hours of synchronized motion, speech, and 3D scene information, standardized in the HumanML3D format. Our framework further connects to a physics-based simulator, enabling synthetic data generation and situated evaluation. By bridging gesture modeling and spatial grounding, our contribution establishes a foundation for advancing research in situated gesture generation and grounded multimodal interaction.

      <title>DP-Fusion: Token-Level Differentially Private Inference for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can leak sensitive information from their context through generated outputs, either accidentally or when prompted adversarially. Existing defenses that aim to preserve context privacy during inference either lack formal guarantees or suffer from a poor utility/privacy trade-off. We propose DP-Fusion, a token-level Differentially Private Inference (DPI) mechanism that provably bounds how much an LLM's outputs reveal about sensitive tokens in its context. We demonstrate DPI through the task of document privatization, where the goal is to paraphrase documents so that sensitive content (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information, PII) cannot be reliably inferred, while still preserving the overall utility of the text. This is controlled by a parameter $\epsilon$: $\epsilon=0$ hides PII entirely, while higher values trade off privacy for improved paraphrase quality. DP-Fusion works as follows: (i) partition sensitive tokens into disjoint privacy groups, (ii) run the LLM once per group, and (iii) blend the output distributions so that the final output remains within a fixed statistical distance of the baseline distribution produced when no privacy group is revealed. This approach allows fine-grained control over the privacy/utility trade-off but requires multiple LLM forward passes.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, but their ability to forecast future events remains understudied. A year ago, large language models struggle to come close to the accuracy of a human crowd. I evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on 464 forecasting questions from Metaculus, comparing their performance against human superforecasters. Frontier models achieve Brier scores that ostensibly surpass the human crowd but still significantly underperform a group of superforecasters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Nile-Chat-4B, 3x4B-A6B, and 12B, a collection of LLMs for Egyptian dialect, uniquely designed to understand and generate texts written in both Arabic and Latin scripts. Specifically, with Nile-Chat-3x4B-A6B, we introduce a novel language adaptation approach by leveraging the Branch-Train-MiX strategy to merge script-specialized experts, into a single MoE model. Our Nile-Chat models significantly outperform leading multilingual and Arabic LLMs, such as LLaMa, Jais, and ALLaM, on our newly introduced Egyptian evaluation benchmarks, which span both understanding and generative tasks. Notably, our 12B model yields a 14.4% performance gain over Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on Latin-script benchmarks. All our resources are publicly available. We believe this work presents a comprehensive methodology for adapting LLMs to dual-script languages, addressing an often overlooked aspect in modern LLM development.</description>

      <title>Lilith: Developmental Modular LLMs with Chemical Signaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current paradigms in Artificial Intelligence rely on layers of feedforward networks which model brain activity at the neuronal level. We conjecture that expanding to the level of multiple brain regions with chemical signaling may be a productive step toward understanding the emergence of consciousness. We propose LILITH, a novel architecture that combines developmental training of modular language models with brain-inspired token-based communication protocols, mirroring chemical signaling in the brain. Our approach models distinct brain regions as specialized LLM modules including thinking, memory, sensory, and regulatory components that communicate through emergent token-based signaling protocols analogous to neurotransmitter networks. Unlike traditional pre-trained systems, LILITH would employ developmental training where untrained LLM architectures learn through simulated life experiences, developing communication pathways and cognitive abilities through environmental interaction and evolutionary optimization. This framework would enable direct empirical investigation of consciousness emergence using Integrated Information Theory metrics while providing unprecedented insight into inter-module signaling patterns during development. By optimizing for consciousness emergence rather than task performance, LILITH could provide insight into different emergent phenomena at multiple levels of neural correlates, contrasting neuronal-level processing with multi-region coordination dynamics. The goal of this paper is to put the idea forward while recognizing the substantial challenges in implementing such a system.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Online Reinforcement Learning using Auxiliary Start State Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-standing problem in online reinforcement learning (RL) is of ensuring sample efficiency, which stems from an inability to explore environments efficiently. Most attempts at efficient exploration tackle this problem in a setting where learning begins from scratch, without prior information available to bootstrap learning. However, such approaches fail to leverage expert demonstrations and simulators that can reset to arbitrary states. These affordances are valuable resources that offer enormous potential to guide exploration and speed up learning. In this paper, we explore how a small number of expert demonstrations and a simulator allowing arbitrary resets can accelerate learning during online RL. We find that training with a suitable choice of an auxiliary start state distribution that may differ from the true start state distribution of the underlying Markov Decision Process can significantly improve sample efficiency. We find that using a notion of safety to inform the choice of this auxiliary distribution significantly accelerates learning. By using episode length information as a way to operationalize this notion, we demonstrate state-of-the-art sample efficiency on a sparse-reward hard-exploration environment.</description>

      <title>PRIME: Large Language Model Personalization with Cognitive Memory and Thought Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to align model outputs with individuals' unique preferences and opinions. While recent efforts have implemented various personalization methods, a unified theoretical framework that can systematically understand the drivers of effective personalization is still lacking. In this work, we integrate the well-established cognitive dual-memory model into LLM personalization, by mirroring episodic memory to historical user engagements and semantic memory to long-term, evolving user beliefs. Specifically, we systematically investigate memory instantiations and introduce a unified framework, PRIME, using episodic and semantic memory mechanisms. We further augment PRIME with a novel personalized thinking capability inspired by the slow thinking strategy. Moreover, recognizing the absence of suitable benchmarks, we introduce a dataset using Change My View (CMV) from Reddit, specifically designed to evaluate long-context personalization. Extensive experiments validate PRIME's effectiveness across both long- and short-context scenarios. Further analysis confirms that PRIME effectively captures dynamic personalization beyond mere popularity biases.</description>

      <title>any4: Learned 4-bit Numeric Representation for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present any4, a learned 4-bit weight quantization solution for large language models (LLMs) providing arbitrary numeric representations without requiring pre-processing of weights or activations. any4 yields higher accuracy compared to other related 4-bit numeric representation types: int4, fp4 and nf4, as evaluated on a range of model sizes, generations and families (Llama 2, Llama 3, Mistral and Mixtral). While any4 does not require preprocessing of weights or activations, it is also competitive with orthogonal techniques that require such preprocessing (e.g., AWQ and GPTQ). We also experiment with any3 and any2 and show competitiveness at lower bits. Additionally, we show that we can calibrate using a single curated diverse sample rather than hundreds of samples from a dataset as done in most quantization approaches. We also open source tinygemm, a latency optimized GPU matrix multiplication library for LLMs, that implements any4 using a GPU-efficient lookup table strategy along with other common quantization methods. We open source our code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/any4 .</description>

      <title>HiLa: Hierarchical Vision-Language Collaboration for Cancer Survival Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Survival prediction using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer re-search. Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their reliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of discriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language (VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as a promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely unexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only one simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn fine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and visual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment. Second, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking the intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective modeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved survival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors to generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region levels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various survival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features via Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive learning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different survival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language alignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation (CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical cooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region levels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance.</description>

      <title>Information-Guided Diffusion Sampling for Dataset Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to create a compact dataset that retains essential information while maintaining model performance. Diffusion models (DMs) have shown promise for this task but struggle in low images-per-class (IPC) settings, where generated samples lack diversity. In this paper, we address this issue from an information-theoretic perspective by identifying two key types of information that a distilled dataset must preserve: ($i$) prototype information $\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$, which captures label-relevant features; and ($ii$) contextual information $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$, which preserves intra-class variability. Here, $(X,Y)$ represents the pair of random variables corresponding to the input data and its ground truth label, respectively. Observing that the required contextual information scales with IPC, we propose maximizing $\mathrm{I}(X;Y) + \beta \mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ during the DM sampling process, where $\beta$ is IPC-dependent. Since directly computing $\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$ and $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ is intractable, we develop variational estimations to tightly lower-bound these quantities via a data-driven approach. Our approach, information-guided diffusion sampling (IGDS), seamlessly integrates with diffusion models and improves dataset distillation across all IPC settings. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet subsets show that IGDS significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-IPC regimes. The code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Multimodal LLM Integrated Semantic Communications for 6G Immersive Experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 6G networks promise revolutionary immersive communication experiences including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and holographic communications. These applications demand high-dimensional multimodal data transmission and intelligent data processing in real-time, which is extremely challenging over resource-limited wireless communication systems. Moreover, a joint understanding of the environment, context, and user intent is essential to deliver task-relevant content effectively. This article presents a novel multimodal large language model (MLLM) integrated semantic communications framework, termed MLLM-SC, which fully leverages reasoning and generative capabilities of pre-trained foundation models for context-aware and task-oriented wireless communication. The MLLM-SC framework adopts a device-edge collaborative architecture. At the edge, MLLM-empowered semantic guidance module analyzes multimodal inputs, user intents, and channel conditions to generate importance-aware attention maps prioritizing semantically critical information. An importance-aware semantic encoder and a resource-adaptive semantic decoder are jointly designed and optimized, which can utilize the semantic guidance for adaptive bandwidth allocation and high-quality content reconstruction or generation. Extensive case studies on visual question answering for AR/VR applications and diffusion-driven image generation validate the effectiveness of MLLM-SC.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Intent-guided Optimization with Pluggable LLM-Driven Semantics for Session-based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Session-based Recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next item a user will likely engage with, using their interaction sequence within an anonymous session. Existing SBR models often focus only on single-session information, ignoring inter-session relationships and valuable cross-session insights. Some methods try to include inter-session data but struggle with noise and irrelevant information, reducing performance. Additionally, most models rely on item ID co-occurrence and overlook rich semantic details, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained item features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hierarchical intent-guided optimization approach with pluggable LLM-driven semantic learning for session-based recommendations, called HIPHOP. First, we introduce a pluggable embedding module based on large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality semantic representations, enhancing item embeddings. Second, HIPHOP utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) to model item transition relationships and incorporates a dynamic multi-intent capturing module to address users' diverse interests within a session. Additionally, we design a hierarchical inter-session similarity learning module, guided by user intent, to capture global and local session relationships, effectively exploring users' long-term and short-term interests. To mitigate noise, an intent-guided denoising strategy is applied during inter-session learning. Finally, we enhance the model's discriminative capability by using contrastive learning to optimize session representations. Experiments on multiple datasets show that HIPHOP significantly outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving recommendation quality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful yet prone to generating factual errors, commonly referred to as hallucinations. We present a lightweight, interpretable framework for knowledge-aware self-correction of LLM outputs using structured memory graphs based on RDF triples. Without retraining or fine-tuning, our method post-processes model outputs and corrects factual inconsistencies via external semantic memory. We demonstrate the approach using DistilGPT-2 and show promising results on simple factual prompts.</description>

      <title>Learning Robust Stereo Matching in the Wild with Selective Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, learning-based stereo matching networks have advanced significantly. However, they often lack robustness and struggle to achieve impressive cross-domain performance due to domain shifts and imbalanced disparity distributions among diverse datasets. Leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) can intuitively enhance the model's robustness, but integrating such a model into stereo matching cost-effectively to fully realize their robustness remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose SMoEStereo, a novel framework that adapts VFMs for stereo matching through a tailored, scene-specific fusion of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) modules. SMoEStereo introduces MoE-LoRA with adaptive ranks and MoE-Adapter with adaptive kernel sizes. The former dynamically selects optimal experts within MoE to adapt varying scenes across domains, while the latter injects inductive bias into frozen VFMs to improve geometric feature extraction. Importantly, to mitigate computational overhead, we further propose a lightweight decision network that selectively activates MoE modules based on input complexity, balancing efficiency with accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits state-of-the-art cross-domain and joint generalization across multiple benchmarks without dataset-specific adaptation. The code is available at \textcolor{red}{https://github.com/cocowy1/SMoE-Stereo}.</description>

      <title>LTMSformer: A Local Trend-Aware Attention and Motion State Encoding Transformer for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been challenging to model the complex temporal-spatial dependencies between agents for trajectory prediction. As each state of an agent is closely related to the states of adjacent time steps, capturing the local temporal dependency is beneficial for prediction, while most studies often overlook it. Besides, learning the high-order motion state attributes is expected to enhance spatial interaction modeling, but it is rarely seen in previous works. To address this, we propose a lightweight framework, LTMSformer, to extract temporal-spatial interaction features for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Specifically, we introduce a Local Trend-Aware Attention mechanism to capture the local temporal dependency by leveraging a convolutional attention mechanism with hierarchical local time boxes. Next, to model the spatial interaction dependency, we build a Motion State Encoder to incorporate high-order motion state attributes, such as acceleration, jerk, heading, etc. To further refine the trajectory prediction, we propose a Lightweight Proposal Refinement Module that leverages Multi-Layer Perceptrons for trajectory embedding and generates the refined trajectories with fewer model parameters. Experiment results on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline HiVT-64, reducing the minADE by approximately 4.35%, the minFDE by 8.74%, and the MR by 20%. We also achieve higher accuracy than HiVT-128 with a 68% reduction in model size.</description>

      <title>What's Making That Sound Right Now? Video-centric Audio-Visual Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04667v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Localization (AVL) aims to identify sound-emitting sources within a visual scene. However, existing studies focus on image-level audio-visual associations, failing to capture temporal dynamics. Moreover, they assume simplified scenarios where sound sources are always visible and involve only a single object. To address these limitations, we propose AVATAR, a video-centric AVL benchmark that incorporates high-resolution temporal information. AVATAR introduces four distinct scenarios -- Single-sound, Mixed-sound, Multi-entity, and Off-screen -- enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of AVL models. Additionally, we present TAVLO, a novel video-centric AVL model that explicitly integrates temporal information. Experimental results show that conventional methods struggle to track temporal variations due to their reliance on global audio features and frame-level mappings. In contrast, TAVLO achieves robust and precise audio-visual alignment by leveraging high-resolution temporal modeling. Our work empirically demonstrates the importance of temporal dynamics in AVL and establishes a new standard for video-centric audio-visual localization.</description>

      <title>Identify, Isolate, and Purge: Mitigating Hallucinations in LVLMs via Self-Evolving Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements in numerous areas such as multimedia. However, hallucination issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential. Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation (\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.</description>

      <title>Bridging KAN and MLP: MJKAN, a Hybrid Architecture with Both Efficiency and Expressiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have garnered attention for replacing fixed activation functions with learnable univariate functions, but they exhibit practical limitations, including high computational costs and performance deficits in general classification tasks. In this paper, we propose the Modulation Joint KAN (MJKAN), a novel neural network layer designed to overcome these challenges. MJKAN integrates a FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation)-like mechanism with Radial Basis Function (RBF) activations, creating a hybrid architecture that combines the non-linear expressive power of KANs with the efficiency of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We empirically validated MJKAN's performance across a diverse set of benchmarks, including function regression, image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100), and natural language processing (AG News, SMS Spam). The results demonstrate that MJKAN achieves superior approximation capabilities in function regression tasks, significantly outperforming MLPs, with performance improving as the number of basis functions increases. Conversely, in image and text classification, its performance was competitive with MLPs but revealed a critical dependency on the number of basis functions. We found that a smaller basis size was crucial for better generalization, highlighting that the model's capacity must be carefully tuned to the complexity of the data to prevent overfitting. In conclusion, MJKAN offers a flexible architecture that inherits the theoretical advantages of KANs while improving computational efficiency and practical viability.</description>

      <title>Tempo-R0: A Video-MLLM for Temporal Video Grounding through Efficient Temporal Sensing Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which requires pinpointing relevant temporal segments from video based on language query, has always been a highly challenging task in the field of video understanding. Videos often have a larger volume of information and redundancy than texts or images. Models should present comprehensive understanding of the whole video to accurately retrieve query-relevant clips. We thus propose Tempo-R0: a Video Multimodal Large Language Model (Video-MLLM) for the temporal video grounding task via multimodal temporal sensing reinforcement. Specifically, during the preprocessing stage of our pipeline, we employ Self-adaptive Attention Allocation (SAA) method based on frame content variation to efficiently use the MLLM's limited attention. The Explicit Timestamp-modal Aligned (ETA) method is also utilized to strengthen our model's capability to perceive the boundaries of events in the video. In the fine-tuning part of our pipeline, we creatively apply Partial Irrelevance Refusing-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (PIR-GRPO) in TVG area to foster model's temporal reasoning from not only accepting relevant video-query pairs but also refusing irrelevant ones. Experiments demonstrate that our method accomplishes a notable advantage over SOTA solutions by around 3.5% on both the original QVHighlights testbench and its corrected version with more reasonable ground truth annotations.</description>

      <title>SPATIA: Multimodal Model for Prediction and Generation of Spatial Cell Phenotypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how cellular morphology, gene expression, and spatial organization jointly shape tissue function is a central challenge in biology. Image-based spatial transcriptomics technologies now provide high-resolution measurements of cell images and gene expression profiles, but machine learning methods typically analyze these modalities in isolation or at limited resolution. We address the problem of learning unified, spatially aware representations that integrate cell morphology, gene expression, and spatial context across biological scales. This requires models that can operate at single-cell resolution, reason across spatial neighborhoods, and generalize to whole-slide tissue organization. Here, we introduce SPATIA, a multi-scale generative and predictive model for spatial transcriptomics. SPATIA learns cell-level embeddings by fusing image-derived morphological tokens and transcriptomic vector tokens using cross-attention and then aggregates them at niche and tissue levels using transformer modules to capture spatial dependencies. SPATIA incorporates token merging in its generative diffusion decoder to synthesize high-resolution cell images conditioned on gene expression. We assembled a multi-scale dataset consisting of 17 million cell-gene pairs, 1 million niche-gene pairs, and 10,000 tissue-gene pairs across 49 donors, 17 tissue types, and 12 disease states. We benchmark SPATIA against 13 existing models across 12 individual tasks, which span several categories including cell annotation, cell clustering, gene imputation, cross-modal prediction, and image generation. SPATIA achieves improved performance over all baselines and generates realistic cell morphologies that reflect transcriptomic perturbations.</description>

      <title>UrbanMind: Towards Urban General Intelligence via Tool-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Multilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban general intelligence (UGI) refers to the capacity of AI systems to autonomously perceive, reason, and act within dynamic and complex urban environments. In this paper, we introduce UrbanMind, a tool-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework designed to facilitate UGI. Central to UrbanMind is a novel architecture based on Continual Retrieval-Augmented MoE-based LLM (C-RAG-LLM), which dynamically incorporates domain-specific knowledge and evolving urban data to support long-term adaptability. The architecture of C-RAG-LLM aligns naturally with a multilevel optimization framework, where different layers are treated as interdependent sub-problems. Each layer has distinct objectives and can be optimized either independently or jointly through a hierarchical learning process. The framework is highly flexible, supporting both end-to-end training and partial layer-wise optimization based on resource or deployment constraints. To remain adaptive under data drift, it is further integrated with an incremental corpus updating mechanism. Evaluations on real-world urban tasks of a variety of complexity verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This work presents a promising step toward the realization of general-purpose LLM agents in future urban environments.</description>

      <title>Geometric-Guided Few-Shot Dental Landmark Detection with Human-Centric Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate detection of anatomic landmarks is essential for assessing alveolar bone and root conditions, thereby optimizing clinical outcomes in orthodontics, periodontics, and implant dentistry. Manual annotation of landmarks on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) by dentists is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subject to inter-observer variability. Deep learning-based automated methods present a promising approach to streamline this process efficiently. However, the scarcity of training data and the high cost of expert annotations hinder the adoption of conventional deep learning techniques. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GeoSapiens, a novel few-shot learning framework designed for robust dental landmark detection using limited annotated CBCT of anterior teeth. Our GeoSapiens framework comprises two key components: (1) a robust baseline adapted from Sapiens, a foundational model that has achieved state-of-the-art performance in human-centric vision tasks, and (2) a novel geometric loss function that improves the model's capacity to capture critical geometric relationships among anatomical structures. Experiments conducted on our collected dataset of anterior teeth landmarks revealed that GeoSapiens surpassed existing landmark detection methods, outperforming the leading approach by an 8.18% higher success detection rate at a strict 0.5 mm threshold-a standard widely recognized in dental diagnostics. Code is available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/GeoSapiens.</description>

      <title>Who's the Mole? Modeling and Detecting Intention-Hiding Malicious Agents in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLM-MAS) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. While LLM-MAS exhibit strong collaborative abilities, the security risks in their communication and coordination remain underexplored. We bridge this gap by systematically investigating intention-hiding threats in LLM-MAS, and design four representative attack paradigms that subtly disrupt task completion while maintaining high concealment. These attacks are evaluated in centralized, decentralized, and layered communication structures. Experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro, HumanEval, GSM8K, arithmetic, and biographies, demonstrate that they exhibit strong disruptive capabilities. To identify these threats, we propose a psychology-based detection framework AgentXposed, which combines the HEXACO personality model with the Reid Technique, using progressive questionnaire inquiries and behavior-based monitoring. Experiments conducted on six types of attacks show that our detection framework effectively identifies all types of malicious behaviors. The detection rate for our intention-hiding attacks is slightly lower than that of the two baselines, Incorrect Fact Injection and Dark Traits Injection, demonstrating the effectiveness of intention concealment. Our findings reveal the structural and behavioral risks posed by intention-hiding attacks and offer valuable insights into securing LLM-based multi-agent systems through psychological perspectives, which contributes to a deeper understanding of multi-agent safety. The code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AgentXposed-F814.</description>

      <title>Losing Control: Data Poisoning Attack on Guided Diffusion via ControlNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in translating textual prompts into high-fidelity images. ControlNets further extend these models by allowing precise, image-based conditioning (e.g., edge maps, depth, pose), enabling fine-grained control over structure and style. However, their dependence on large, publicly scraped datasets -- and the increasing use of community-shared data for fine-tuning -- exposes them to stealthy data poisoning attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel data poisoning method that manipulates ControlNets to generate images containing specific content without any text triggers. By injecting poisoned samples -- each pairing a subtly triggered input with an NSFW target -- the model retains clean-prompt fidelity yet reliably produces NSFW outputs when the trigger is present. On large-scale, high-quality datasets, our backdoor achieves high attack success rate while remaining imperceptible in raw inputs. These results reveal a critical vulnerability in open-source ControlNets pipelines and underscore the need for robust data sanitization and defense mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Word stress in self-supervised speech models: A cross-linguistic comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study word stress representations learned by self-supervised speech models (S3M), specifically the Wav2vec 2.0 model. We investigate the S3M representations of word stress for five different languages: Three languages with variable or lexical stress (Dutch, English and German) and two languages with fixed or demarcative stress (Hungarian and Polish). We train diagnostic stress classifiers on S3M embeddings and show that they can distinguish between stressed and unstressed syllables in read-aloud short sentences with high accuracy. We also tested language-specificity effects of S3M word stress. The results indicate that the word stress representations are language-specific, with a greater difference between the set of variable versus the set of fixed stressed languages.</description>

      <title>MCFormer: A Multi-Cost-Volume Network and Comprehensive Benchmark for Particle Image Velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is fundamental to fluid dynamics, yet deep learning applications face significant hurdles. A critical gap exists: the lack of comprehensive evaluation of how diverse optical flow models perform specifically on PIV data, largely due to limitations in available datasets and the absence of a standardized benchmark. This prevents fair comparison and hinders progress. To address this, our primary contribution is a novel, large-scale synthetic PIV benchmark dataset generated from diverse CFD simulations (JHTDB and Blasius). It features unprecedented variety in particle densities, flow velocities, and continuous motion, enabling, for the first time, a standardized and rigorous evaluation of various optical flow and PIV algorithms. Complementing this, we propose Multi Cost Volume PIV (MCFormer), a new deep network architecture leveraging multi-frame temporal information and multiple cost volumes, specifically designed for PIV's sparse nature. Our comprehensive benchmark evaluation, the first of its kind, reveals significant performance variations among adapted optical flow models and demonstrates that MCFormer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving the lowest overall normalized endpoint error (NEPE). This work provides both a foundational benchmark resource essential for future PIV research and a state-of-the-art method tailored for PIV challenges. We make our benchmark dataset and code publicly available to foster future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Network Intrusion Detection Systems: Foundations, Implementations, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various fields with their exceptional capabilities in understanding, processing, and generating human-like text. This paper investigates the potential of LLMs in advancing Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), analyzing current challenges, methodologies, and future opportunities. It begins by establishing a foundational understanding of NIDS and LLMs, exploring the enabling technologies that bridge the gap between intelligent and cognitive systems in AI-driven NIDS. While Intelligent NIDS leverage machine learning and deep learning to detect threats based on learned patterns, they often lack contextual awareness and explainability. In contrast, Cognitive NIDS integrate LLMs to process both structured and unstructured security data, enabling deeper contextual reasoning, explainable decision-making, and automated response for intrusion behaviors. Practical implementations are then detailed, highlighting LLMs as processors, detectors, and explainers within a comprehensive AI-driven NIDS pipeline. Furthermore, the concept of an LLM-centered Controller is proposed, emphasizing its potential to coordinate intrusion detection workflows, optimizing tool collaboration and system performance. Finally, this paper identifies critical challenges and opportunities, aiming to foster innovation in developing reliable, adaptive, and explainable NIDS. By presenting the transformative potential of LLMs, this paper seeks to inspire advancement in next-generation network security systems.</description>

      <title>CoSteer: Collaborative Decoding-Time Personalization via Local Delta Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized text generation has become crucial for adapting language models to diverse and evolving users' personal context across cultural, temporal, and contextual dimensions. While existing methods often rely on centralized fine-tuning or static preference alignment, they struggle to achieve real-time adaptation under resource constraints inherent to personal devices. This limitation creates a dilemma: large cloud-based models lack access to localized user-specific information, while small on-device models cannot match the generation quality of their cloud counterparts. To address this dichotomy, we present CoSteer, a novel collaborative framework that enables decoding-time personalization through localized delta steering. Our key insight lies in leveraging the logits difference between personal context-aware and -agnostic outputs from local small models as steering signals for cloud-based LLMs. Specifically, we formulate token-level optimization as an online learning problem, where local delta vectors dynamically adjust the remote LLM's logits within the on-device environment. This approach preserves privacy by transmitting only the final steered tokens rather than raw data or intermediate vectors, while maintaining cloud-based LLMs' general capabilities without fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on various personalized generation tasks, we demonstrate that CoSteer effectively assists LLMs in generating personalized content by leveraging locally stored user profiles and histories, ensuring privacy preservation through on-device data processing while maintaining acceptable computational overhead.</description>

      <title>From Imitation to Innovation: The Emergence of AI Unique Artistic Styles and the Challenge of Copyright Protection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current legal frameworks consider AI-generated works eligible for copyright protection when they meet originality requirements and involve substantial human intellectual input. However, systematic legal standards and reliable evaluation methods for AI art copyrights are lacking. Through comprehensive analysis of legal precedents, we establish three essential criteria for determining distinctive artistic style: stylistic consistency, creative uniqueness, and expressive accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce ArtBulb, an interpretable and quantifiable framework for AI art copyright judgment that combines a novel style description-based multimodal clustering method with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We also present AICD, the first benchmark dataset for AI art copyright annotated by artists and legal experts. Experimental results demonstrate that ArtBulb outperforms existing models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our work aims to bridge the gap between the legal and technological communities and bring greater attention to the societal issue of AI art copyrights.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Merged Motion Planning: Effectively Leveraging Diverse Motion Datasets for Robust Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component of autonomous robot driving. While various trajectory datasets exist, effectively utilizing them for a target domain remains challenging due to differences in agent interactions and environmental characteristics. Conventional approaches, such as domain adaptation or ensemble learning, leverage multiple source datasets but suffer from domain imbalance, catastrophic forgetting, and high computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose Interaction-Merged Motion Planning (IMMP), a novel approach that leverages parameter checkpoints trained on different domains during adaptation to the target domain. IMMP follows a two-step process: pre-merging to capture agent behaviors and interactions, sufficiently extracting diverse information from the source domain, followed by merging to construct an adaptable model that efficiently transfers diverse interactions to the target domain. Our method is evaluated on various planning benchmarks and models, demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Model Compression using Progressive Channel Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple but effective channel pruning framework called Progressive Channel Pruning (PCP) to accelerate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In contrast to the existing channel pruning methods that prune channels only once per layer in a layer-by-layer fashion, our new progressive framework iteratively prunes a small number of channels from several selected layers, which consists of a three-step attempting-selecting-pruning pipeline in each iteration. In the attempting step, we attempt to prune a pre-defined number of channels from one layer by using any existing channel pruning methods and estimate the accuracy drop for this layer based on the labelled samples in the validation set. In the selecting step, based on the estimated accuracy drops for all layers, we propose a greedy strategy to automatically select a set of layers that will lead to less overall accuracy drop after pruning these layers. In the pruning step, we prune a small number of channels from these selected layers. We further extend our PCP framework to prune channels for the deep transfer learning methods like Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN), in which we effectively reduce the data distribution mismatch in the channel pruning process by using both labelled samples from the source domain and pseudo-labelled samples from the target domain. Our comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PCP framework outperforms the existing channel pruning approaches under both supervised learning and transfer learning settings.</description>

Abstract: Pun generation seeks to creatively modify linguistic elements in text to produce humour or evoke double meanings. It also aims to preserve coherence and contextual appropriateness, making it useful in creative writing and entertainment across various media and contexts. Although pun generation has received considerable attention in computational linguistics, there is currently no dedicated survey that systematically reviews this specific area. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of pun generation datasets and methods across different stages, including conventional approaches, deep learning techniques, and pre-trained language models. Additionally, we summarise both automated and human evaluation metrics used to assess the quality of pun generation. Finally, we discuss the research challenges and propose promising directions for future work.</description>

      <title>From Vision To Language through Graph of Events in Space and Time: An Explainable Self-supervised Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of describing video content in natural language is commonly referred to as video captioning. Unlike conventional video captions, which are typically brief and widely available, long-form paragraph descriptions in natural language are scarce. This limitation of current datasets is due to the expensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task of explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the underlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and time. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available datasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the problem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of descriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while state-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating shorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos and text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and language is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a shared representation between vision and language, based on graphs of events in space and time, which can be obtained in an explainable and analytical way, to integrate and connect multiple vision tasks to produce the final natural language description. Moreover, we also demonstrate how our automated and explainable video description generation process can function as a fully automatic teacher to effectively train direct, end-to-end neural student pathways, within a self-supervised neuro-analytical system. We validate that our explainable neuro-analytical approach generates coherent, rich and relevant textual descriptions on videos collected from multiple varied datasets, using both standard evaluation metrics, human annotations and consensus from ensembles of state-of-the-art VLMs.</description>

      <title>Fast-VGAN: Lightweight Voice Conversion with Explicit Control of F0 and Duration Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise control over speech characteristics, such as pitch, duration, and speech rate, remains a significant challenge in the field of voice conversion. The ability to manipulate parameters like pitch and syllable rate is an important element for effective identity conversion, but can also be used independently for voice transformation, achieving goals that were historically addressed by vocoder-based methods.
  In this work, we explore a convolutional neural network-based approach that aims to provide means for modifying fundamental frequency (F0), phoneme sequences, intensity, and speaker identity. Rather than relying on disentanglement techniques, our model is explicitly conditioned on these factors to generate mel spectrograms, which are then converted into waveforms using a universal neural vocoder. Accordingly, during inference, F0 contours, phoneme sequences, and speaker embeddings can be freely adjusted, allowing for intuitively controlled voice transformations.
  We evaluate our approach on speaker conversion and expressive speech tasks using both perceptual and objective metrics. The results suggest that the proposed method offers substantial flexibility, while maintaining high intelligibility and speaker similarity.</description>

      <title>Towards Human-in-the-Loop Onset Detection: A Transfer Learning Approach for Maracatu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore transfer learning strategies for musical onset detection in the Afro-Brazilian Maracatu tradition, which features complex rhythmic patterns that challenge conventional models. We adapt two Temporal Convolutional Network architectures: one pre-trained for onset detection (intra-task) and another for beat tracking (inter-task). Using only 5-second annotated snippets per instrument, we fine-tune these models through layer-wise retraining strategies for five traditional percussion instruments. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline performance, with F1 scores reaching up to 0.998 in the intra-task setting and improvements of over 50 percentage points in best-case scenarios. The cross-task adaptation proves particularly effective for time-keeping instruments, where onsets naturally align with beat positions. The optimal fine-tuning configuration varies by instrument, highlighting the importance of instrument-specific adaptation strategies. This approach addresses the challenges of underrepresented musical traditions, offering an efficient human-in-the-loop methodology that minimizes annotation effort while maximizing performance. Our findings contribute to more inclusive music information retrieval tools applicable beyond Western musical contexts.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach for Estimating Positive Lyapunov Exponents in One-Dimensional Chaotic Time Series Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and quantifying chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems remains a fundamental challenge in science and engineering. The Lyapunov exponent is a key measure of chaotic behavior, but its accurate estimation from experimental data is often hindered by methodological and computational limitations. In this work, we present a novel machine-learning-based approach for estimating the positive Lyapunov exponent (MLE) from one-dimensional time series, using the growth of out-of-sample prediction errors as a proxy for trajectory divergence. Our method demonstrates high scientific relevance, offering a robust, data-driven alternative to traditional analytic techniques. Through comprehensive testing on several canonical chaotic maps - including the logistic, sine, cubic, and Chebyshev maps - we achieved a coefficient of determination R2pos &gt; 0.9 between predicted and theoretical MLE values for time series as short as M = 200 points. The best accuracy was observed for the Chebyshev map (R2pos = 0.999). Notably, the proposed method maintains high computational efficiency and generalizes well across various machine learning algorithms. These results highlight the significance of our approach for practical chaos analysis in both synthetic and experimental settings, opening new possibilities for robust nonlinear dynamics assessment when only time series data are available.</description>

      <title>HGNet: High-Order Spatial Awareness Hypergraph and Multi-Scale Context Attention Network for Colorectal Polyp Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is closely linked to the malignant transformation of colorectal polyps, making early detection essential. However, current models struggle with detecting small lesions, accurately localizing boundaries, and providing interpretable decisions. To address these issues, we propose HGNet, which integrates High-Order Spatial Awareness Hypergraph and Multi-Scale Context Attention. Key innovations include: (1) an Efficient Multi-Scale Context Attention (EMCA) module to enhance lesion feature representation and boundary modeling; (2) the deployment of a spatial hypergraph convolution module before the detection head to capture higher-order spatial relationships between nodes; (3) the application of transfer learning to address the scarcity of medical image data; and (4) Eigen Class Activation Map (Eigen-CAM) for decision visualization. Experimental results show that HGNet achieves 94% accuracy, 90.6% recall, and 90% mAP@0.5, significantly improving small lesion differentiation and clinical interpretability. The source code will be made publicly available upon publication of this paper.</description>

      <title>Beyond Training-time Poisoning: Component-level and Post-training Backdoors in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems are increasingly used in safety-critical applications, yet their security remains severely underexplored. This work investigates backdoor attacks, which implant hidden triggers that cause malicious actions only when specific inputs appear in the observation space. Existing DRL backdoor research focuses solely on training-time attacks requiring unrealistic access to the training pipeline. In contrast, we reveal critical vulnerabilities across the DRL supply chain where backdoors can be embedded with significantly reduced adversarial privileges. We introduce two novel attacks: (1) TrojanentRL, which exploits component-level flaws to implant a persistent backdoor that survives full model retraining; and (2) InfrectroRL, a post-training backdoor attack which requires no access to training, validation, nor test data. Empirical and analytical evaluations across six Atari environments show our attacks rival state-of-the-art training-time backdoor attacks while operating under much stricter adversarial constraints. We also demonstrate that InfrectroRL further evades two leading DRL backdoor defenses. These findings challenge the current research focus and highlight the urgent need for robust defenses.</description>

      <title>Emergent Semantics Beyond Token Embeddings: Transformer LMs with Frozen Visual Unicode Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the locus of semantic representation in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for interpretability and architectural innovation. The dominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational "meaning vectors." This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer models where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not from data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic, precomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is compatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we introduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable, semantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent text, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with trainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to "representational interference" in conventional models, where the embedding layer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our results indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings but are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture and data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to structural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further research.</description>

      <title>BackFed: An Efficient &amp; Standardized Benchmark Suite for Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) systems are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries train their local models on poisoned data and submit poisoned model updates to compromise the global model. Despite numerous proposed attacks and defenses, divergent experimental settings, implementation errors, and unrealistic assumptions hinder fair comparisons and valid conclusions about their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce BackFed - a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to standardize, streamline, and reliably evaluate backdoor attacks and defenses in FL, with a focus on practical constraints. Our benchmark offers key advantages through its multi-processing implementation that significantly accelerates experimentation and the modular design that enables seamless integration of new methods via well-defined APIs. With a standardized evaluation pipeline, we envision BackFed as a plug-and-play environment for researchers to comprehensively and reliably evaluate new attacks and defenses. Using BackFed, we conduct large-scale studies of representative backdoor attacks and defenses across both Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks with diverse model architectures and experimental settings. Our experiments critically assess the performance of proposed attacks and defenses, revealing unknown limitations and modes of failures under practical conditions. These empirical insights provide valuable guidance for the development of new methods and for enhancing the security of FL systems. Our framework is openly available at https://github.com/thinh-dao/BackFed.</description>

      <title>HV-MMBench: Benchmarking MLLMs for Human-Centric Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in visual understanding tasks involving both images and videos. However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks, ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term (10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual lengths.</description>

      <title>Leadership Detection via Time-Lagged Correlation-Based Network Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding leadership dynamics in collective behavior is a key challenge in animal ecology, swarm robotics, and intelligent transportation. Traditional information-theoretic approaches, including Transfer Entropy (TE) and Time-Lagged Mutual Information (TLMI), have been widely used to infer leader-follower relationships but face critical limitations in noisy or short-duration datasets due to their reliance on robust probability estimations. This study proposes a method based on dynamic network inference using time-lagged correlations across multiple kinematic variables: velocity, acceleration, and direction. Our approach constructs directed influence graphs over time, enabling the identification of leadership patterns without the need for large volumes of data or parameter-sensitive discretization. We validate our method through two multi-agent simulations in NetLogo: a modified Vicsek model with informed leaders and a predator-prey model featuring coordinated and independent wolf groups. Experimental results demonstrate that the network-based method outperforms TE and TLMI in scenarios with limited spatiotemporal observations, ranking true leaders at the top of influence metrics more consistently than TE and TLMI.</description>

      <title>Object-centric Denoising Diffusion Models for Physical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning about the trajectories of multiple, interacting objects is integral to physical reasoning tasks in machine learning. This involves conditions imposed on the objects at different time steps, for instance initial states or desired goal states. Existing approaches in physical reasoning generally rely on autoregressive modeling, which can only be conditioned on initial states, but not on later states. In fields such as planning for reinforcement learning, similar challenges are being addressed with denoising diffusion models. In this work, we propose an object-centric denoising diffusion model architecture for physical reasoning that is translation equivariant over time, permutation equivariant over objects, and can be conditioned on arbitrary time steps for arbitrary objects. We demonstrate how this model can solve tasks with multiple conditions and examine its performance when changing object numbers and trajectory lengths during inference.</description>

      <title>DC-AR: Efficient Masked Autoregressive Image Generation with Deep Compression Hybrid Tokenizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DC-AR, a novel masked autoregressive (AR) text-to-image generation framework that delivers superior image generation quality with exceptional computational efficiency. Due to the tokenizers' limitations, prior masked AR models have lagged behind diffusion models in terms of quality or efficiency. We overcome this limitation by introducing DC-HT - a deep compression hybrid tokenizer for AR models that achieves a 32x spatial compression ratio while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity and cross-resolution generalization ability. Building upon DC-HT, we extend MaskGIT and create a new hybrid masked autoregressive image generation framework that first produces the structural elements through discrete tokens and then applies refinements via residual tokens. DC-AR achieves state-of-the-art results with a gFID of 5.49 on MJHQ-30K and an overall score of 0.69 on GenEval, while offering 1.5-7.9x higher throughput and 2.0-3.5x lower latency compared to prior leading diffusion and autoregressive models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Expotion (Facial Expression and Motion Control for Multimodal Music Generation), a generative model leveraging multimodal visual controls - specifically, human facial expressions and upper-body motion - as well as text prompts to produce expressive and temporally accurate music. We adopt parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on the pretrained text-to-music generation model, enabling fine-grained adaptation to the multimodal controls using a small dataset. To ensure precise synchronization between video and music, we introduce a temporal smoothing strategy to align multiple modalities. Experiments demonstrate that integrating visual features alongside textual descriptions enhances the overall quality of generated music in terms of musicality, creativity, beat-tempo consistency, temporal alignment with the video, and text adherence, surpassing both proposed baselines and existing state-of-the-art video-to-music generation models. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset consisting of 7 hours of synchronized video recordings capturing expressive facial and upper-body gestures aligned with corresponding music, providing significant potential for future research in multimodal and interactive music generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation shows great potential in fields such as film production. Despite significant advances, current V2A methods, which rely on global video information, struggle with complex scenes and often fail to generate audio tailored to specific objects or regions in the videos. To address these limitations, we introduce Hear-Your-Click, an interactive V2A framework that enables users to generate sounds for specific objects in the videos by simply clicking on the frame. To achieve this, we propose Object-aware Contrastive Audio-Visual Fine-tuning (OCAV) with a Mask-guided Visual Encoder (MVE) to obtain object-level visual features aligned with corresponding audio segments. Furthermore, we tailor two data augmentation strategies: Random Video Stitching (RVS) and Mask-guided Loudness Modulation (MLM), aimed at enhancing the model's sensitivity to the segmented objects. To effectively measure the audio-visual correspondence, we design a new evaluation metric, the CAV score, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework offers more precise control and improved generation performance across various metrics.

      <title>LAPS-Diff: A Diffusion-Based Framework for Singing Voice Synthesis With Language Aware Prosody-Style Guided Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) has seen significant advancements in recent years due to the rapid progress of diffusion-based approaches. However, capturing vocal style, genre-specific pitch inflections, and language-dependent characteristics remains challenging, particularly in low-resource scenarios. To address this, we propose LAPS-Diff, a diffusion model integrated with language-aware embeddings and a vocal-style guided learning mechanism, specifically designed for Bollywood Hindi singing style. We curate a Hindi SVS dataset and leverage pre-trained language models to extract word and phone-level embeddings for an enriched lyrics representation. Additionally, we incorporated a style encoder and a pitch extraction model to compute style and pitch losses, capturing features essential to the naturalness and expressiveness of the synthesized singing, particularly in terms of vocal style and pitch variations. Furthermore, we utilize MERT and IndicWav2Vec models to extract musical and contextual embeddings, serving as conditional priors to refine the acoustic feature generation process further. Based on objective and subjective evaluations, we demonstrate that LAPS-Diff significantly improves the quality of the generated samples compared to the considered state-of-the-art (SOTA) model for our constrained dataset that is typical of the low resource scenario.</description>

      <title>Classification of autoimmune diseases from Peripheral blood TCR repertoires by multimodal multi-instance learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04981v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires encode critical immunological signatures for autoimmune diseases, yet their clinical application remains limited by sequence sparsity and low witness rates. We developed EAMil, a multi-instance deep learning framework that leverages TCR sequencing data to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with exceptional accuracy. By integrating PrimeSeq feature extraction with ESMonehot encoding and enhanced gate attention mechanisms, our model achieved state-of-the-art performance with AUCs of 98.95% for SLE and 97.76% for RA. EAMil successfully identified disease-associated genes with over 90% concordance with established differential analyses and effectively distinguished disease-specific TCR genes. The model demonstrated robustness in classifying multiple disease categories, utilizing the SLEDAI score to stratify SLE patients by disease severity as well as to diagnose the site of damage in SLE patients, and effectively controlling for confounding factors such as age and gender. This interpretable framework for immune receptor analysis provides new insights for autoimmune disease detection and classification with broad potential clinical applications across immune-mediated conditions.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Representations for Fine-grained Multi-label Critical View of Safety Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Critical View of Safety (CVS) is crucial for safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy, yet assessing CVS criteria remains a complex and challenging task, even for experts. Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on vision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations. This study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both training and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate CVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily adapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label framework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a significant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose CVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained, binary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with textual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts. By adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the Endoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the ResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that CVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts, boosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific inference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment. While further work is needed to match state-of-the-art spatial annotation-based methods, this approach highlights the potential of adapting generalist models to specialized surgical tasks.

      <title>Meta-Learning Transformers to Improve In-Context Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning enables transformer models to generalize to new tasks based solely on input prompts, without any need for weight updates. However, existing training paradigms typically rely on large, unstructured datasets that are costly to store, difficult to evaluate for quality and balance, and pose privacy and ethical concerns due to the inclusion of sensitive information. Motivated by these limitations and risks, we propose an alternative training strategy where we leverage a collection of multiple, small-scale, and domain-specific datasets. We empirically demonstrate that the increased quality and diversity of such data improve the generalization abilities of in-context learners beyond their training domain, while achieving comparable performance with models trained on a single large-scale dataset. We investigate this paradigm by leveraging meta-learning to train an in-context learner on the Meta-Album collection under several settings. Firstly, we show the performance in a controlled environment, where the test domain is completely excluded from the training knowledge. Secondly, we explore the robustness of these models to forgetting in a continual scenario where the information is accessible for a limited time. Finally, we explore the more challenging unsupervised scenario. Our findings demonstrate that transformers still generalize for in-context prediction when trained on a curated dataset collection while offering advantages in modularity and replaceability.</description>

      <title>Adaptation of Multi-modal Representation Models for Multi-task Surgical Computer Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surgical AI often involves multiple tasks within a single procedure, like phase recognition or assessing the Critical View of Safety in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Traditional models, built for one task at a time, lack flexibility, requiring a separate model for each. To address this, we introduce MML-SurgAdapt, a unified multi-task framework with Vision-Language Models (VLMs), specifically CLIP, to handle diverse surgical tasks through natural language supervision. A key challenge in multi-task learning is the presence of partial annotations when integrating different tasks. To overcome this, we employ Single Positive Multi-Label (SPML) learning, which traditionally reduces annotation burden by training models with only one positive label per instance. Our framework extends this approach to integrate data from multiple surgical tasks within a single procedure, enabling effective learning despite incomplete or noisy annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a combined dataset consisting of Cholec80, Endoscapes2023, and CholecT50, utilizing custom prompts. Extensive evaluation shows that MML-SurgAdapt performs comparably to task-specific benchmarks, with the added advantage of handling noisy annotations. It also outperforms the existing SPML frameworks for the task. By reducing the required labels by 23%, our approach proposes a more scalable and efficient labeling process, significantly easing the annotation burden on clinicians. To our knowledge, this is the first application of SPML to integrate data from multiple surgical tasks, presenting a novel and generalizable solution for multi-task learning in surgical computer vision. Implementation is available at: https://github.com/CAMMA-public/MML-SurgAdapt</description>

      <title>Perspectives on How Sociology Can Advance Theorizing about Human-Chatbot Interaction and Developing Chatbots for Social Good</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, research into chatbots (also known as conversational agents, AI agents, voice assistants), which are computer applications using artificial intelligence to mimic human-like conversation, has grown sharply. Despite this growth, sociology lags other disciplines (including computer science, medicine, psychology, and communication) in publishing about chatbots. We suggest sociology can advance understanding of human-chatbot interaction and offer four sociological theories to enhance extant work in this field. The first two theories (resource substitution theory, power-dependence theory) add new insights to existing models of the drivers of chatbot use, which overlook sociological concerns about how social structure (e.g., systemic discrimination, the uneven distribution of resources within networks) inclines individuals to use chatbots, including problematic levels of emotional dependency on chatbots. The second two theories (affect control theory, fundamental cause of disease theory) help inform the development of chatbot-driven interventions that minimize safety risks and enhance equity by leveraging sociological insights into how chatbot outputs could attend to cultural contexts (e.g., affective norms) to promote wellbeing and enhance communities (e.g., opportunities for civic participation). We discuss the value of applying sociological theories for advancing theorizing about human-chatbot interaction and developing chatbots for social good.</description>

      <title>INTER: Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models by Interaction Guidance Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) pose significant challenges for real-world applications, as LVLMs may generate responses that appear plausible yet remain inconsistent with the associated visual content. This issue rarely occurs in human cognition. We argue that this discrepancy arises from humans' ability to effectively leverage multimodal interaction information in data samples. Specifically, humans typically first gather multimodal information, analyze the interactions across modalities for understanding, and then express their understanding through language. Motivated by this observation, we conduct extensive experiments on popular LVLMs and obtained insights that surprisingly reveal human-like, though less pronounced, cognitive behavior of LVLMs on multimodal samples. Building on these findings, we further propose \textbf{INTER}: \textbf{Inter}action Guidance Sampling, a novel training-free algorithm that mitigate hallucinations without requiring additional data. Specifically, INTER explicitly guides LVLMs to effectively reapply their understanding of multimodal interaction information when generating responses, thereby reducing potential hallucinations. On six benchmarks including VQA and image captioning tasks, INTER achieves an average improvement of up to 3.4\% on five LVLMs compared to the state-of-the-art decoding strategy. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.</description>

      <title>Replacing thinking with tool usage enables reasoning in small language models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances have established a new machine learning paradigm based on scaling up compute at inference time as well as at training time. In that line of work, a combination of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on synthetic demonstrations and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is used for training Large Language Models to expend extra compute during inference in the form of "thoughts" expressed in natural language. In this paper, we propose to instead format these tokens as a multi-turn interaction trace with a stateful tool. At each turn, the new state of the tool is appended to the context of the model, whose job is to generate the tokens necessary to control the tool via a custom DSL. We benchmark this approach on the problem of repairing malfunctioning Python code, and show that this constrained setup allows for faster sampling of experience and a denser reward signal, allowing even models of size up to 3B parameters to learn how to proficiently expend additional compute on the task.</description>

      <title>ICAS: Detecting Training Data from Autoregressive Image Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive image generation has witnessed rapid advancements, with prominent models such as scale-wise visual auto-regression pushing the boundaries of visual synthesis. However, these developments also raise significant concerns regarding data privacy and copyright. In response, training data detection has emerged as a critical task for identifying unauthorized data usage in model training. To better understand the vulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we conduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our approach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive score aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise classification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score aggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on the tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is more likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for LLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image scenarios. Moreover, our approach exhibits strong robustness and generalization under various data transformations. Furthermore, sufficient experiments suggest two novel key findings: (1) A linear scaling law on membership inference, exposing the vulnerability of large foundation models. (2) Training data from scale-wise visual autoregressive models is easier to detect than other autoregressive paradigms.Our code is available at https://github.com/Chrisqcwx/ImageAR-MIA.</description>

      <title>Sequential Attention-based Sampling for Histopathological Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly applied for automated histopathology. Yet, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often acquired at gigapixel sizes, rendering it computationally infeasible to analyze them entirely at high resolution. Diagnostic labels are largely available only at the slide-level, because expert annotation of images at a finer (patch) level is both laborious and expensive. Moreover, regions with diagnostic information typically occupy only a small fraction of the WSI, making it inefficient to examine the entire slide at full resolution. Here, we propose SASHA -- {\it S}equential {\it A}ttention-based {\it S}ampling for {\it H}istopathological {\it A}nalysis -- a deep reinforcement learning approach for efficient analysis of histopathological images. First, SASHA learns informative features with a lightweight hierarchical, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model. Second, SASHA samples intelligently and zooms selectively into a small fraction (10-20\%) of high-resolution patches, to achieve reliable diagnosis. We show that SASHA matches state-of-the-art methods that analyze the WSI fully at high-resolution, albeit at a fraction of their computational and memory costs. In addition, it significantly outperforms competing, sparse sampling methods. We propose SASHA as an intelligent sampling model for medical imaging challenges that involve automated diagnosis with exceptionally large images containing sparsely informative features.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Threat in Plain Text: Attacking RAG Data Loaders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed human-machine interaction since ChatGPT's 2022 debut, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a key framework that enhances LLM outputs by integrating external knowledge. However, RAG's reliance on ingesting external documents introduces new vulnerabilities. This paper exposes a critical security gap at the data loading stage, where malicious actors can stealthily corrupt RAG pipelines by exploiting document ingestion.
  We propose a taxonomy of 9 knowledge-based poisoning attacks and introduce two novel threat vectors -- Content Obfuscation and Content Injection -- targeting common formats (DOCX, HTML, PDF). Using an automated toolkit implementing 19 stealthy injection techniques, we test five popular data loaders, finding a 74.4% attack success rate across 357 scenarios. We further validate these threats on six end-to-end RAG systems -- including white-box pipelines and black-box services like NotebookLM and OpenAI Assistants -- demonstrating high success rates and critical vulnerabilities that bypass filters and silently compromise output integrity. Our results emphasize the urgent need to secure the document ingestion process in RAG systems against covert content manipulations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Features: How Dataset Design Influences Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is critical for safe autonomous navigation, yet the impact of dataset design on model performance remains understudied. This work systematically examines how feature selection, cross-dataset transfer, and geographic diversity influence trajectory prediction accuracy in multi-agent settings. We evaluate a state-of-the-art model using our novel L4 Motion Forecasting dataset based on our own data recordings in Germany and the US. This includes enhanced map and agent features. We compare our dataset to the US-centric Argoverse 2 benchmark. First, we find that incorporating supplementary map and agent features unique to our dataset, yields no measurable improvement over baseline features, demonstrating that modern architectures do not need extensive feature sets for optimal performance. The limited features of public datasets are sufficient to capture convoluted interactions without added complexity. Second, we perform cross-dataset experiments to evaluate how effective domain knowledge can be transferred between datasets. Third, we group our dataset by country and check the knowledge transfer between different driving cultures.</description>

      <title>PRING: Rethinking Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction from Pairs to Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality, multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818 interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories, consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The dataset and source code of PRING are available at https://github.com/SophieSarceau/PRING.</description>

      <title>Reviving Cultural Heritage: A Novel Approach for Comprehensive Historical Document Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historical documents represent an invaluable cultural heritage, yet have undergone significant degradation over time through tears, water erosion, and oxidation. Existing Historical Document Restoration (HDR) methods primarily focus on single modality or limited-size restoration, failing to meet practical needs. To fill this gap, we present a full-page HDR dataset (FPHDR) and a novel automated HDR solution (AutoHDR). Specifically, FPHDR comprises 1,633 real and 6,543 synthetic images with character-level and line-level locations, as well as character annotations in different damage grades. AutoHDR mimics historians' restoration workflows through a three-stage approach: OCR-assisted damage localization, vision-language context text prediction, and patch autoregressive appearance restoration. The modular architecture of AutoHDR enables seamless human-machine collaboration, allowing for flexible intervention and optimization at each restoration stage. Experiments demonstrate AutoHDR's remarkable performance in HDR. When processing severely damaged documents, our method improves OCR accuracy from 46.83\% to 84.05\%, with further enhancement to 94.25\% through human-machine collaboration. We believe this work represents a significant advancement in automated historical document restoration and contributes substantially to cultural heritage preservation. The model and dataset are available at https://github.com/SCUT-DLVCLab/AutoHDR.</description>

Abstract: In the field of robotics, researchers face a critical challenge in ensuring reliable and efficient task planning. Verifying high-level task plans before execution significantly reduces errors and enhance the overall performance of these systems. In this paper, we propose an architecture for automatically verifying high-level task plans before their execution in simulator or real-world environments. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our approach consists of two key steps: first, the conversion of natural language instructions into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), followed by a comprehensive analysis of action sequences. The module uses the reasoning capabilities of the LLM to evaluate logical coherence and identify potential gaps in the plan. Rigorous testing on datasets of varying complexity demonstrates the broad applicability of the module to household tasks. We contribute to improving the reliability and efficiency of task planning and addresses the critical need for robust pre-execution verification in autonomous systems.

      <title>LVM4CSI: Enabling Direct Application of Pre-Trained Large Vision Models for Wireless Channel Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical to the performance of wireless communication systems, especially with the increasing scale and complexity introduced by 5G and future 6G technologies. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising approach to CSI acquisition and utilization, existing methods largely depend on task-specific neural networks (NNs) that require expert-driven design and large training datasets, limiting their generalizability and practicality. To address these challenges, we propose LVM4CSI, a general and efficient framework that leverages the structural similarity between CSI and computer vision (CV) data to directly apply large vision models (LVMs) pre-trained on extensive CV datasets to wireless tasks without any fine-tuning, in contrast to large language model-based methods that generally necessitate fine-tuning. LVM4CSI maps CSI tasks to analogous CV tasks, transforms complex-valued CSI into visual formats compatible with LVMs, and integrates lightweight trainable layers to adapt extracted features to specific communication objectives. We validate LVM4CSI through three representative case studies, including channel estimation, human activity recognition, and user localization. Results demonstrate that LVM4CSI achieves comparable or superior performance to task-specific NNs, including an improvement exceeding 9.61 dB in channel estimation and approximately 40% reduction in localization error. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters and eliminates the need for task-specific NN design.</description>

      <title>An Evaluation of Large Language Models on Text Summarization Tasks Using Prompt Engineering Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance natural language processing with their ability to generate human-like text across a range of tasks. Despite the remarkable success of LLMs in Natural Language Processing (NLP), their performance in text summarization across various domains and datasets has not been comprehensively evaluated. At the same time, the ability to summarize text effectively without relying on extensive training data has become a crucial bottleneck. To address these issues, we present a systematic evaluation of six LLMs across four datasets: CNN/Daily Mail and NewsRoom (news), SAMSum (dialog), and ArXiv (scientific). By leveraging prompt engineering techniques including zero-shot and in-context learning, our study evaluates the performance using the ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. In addition, a detailed analysis of inference times is conducted to better understand the trade-off between summarization quality and computational efficiency. For Long documents, introduce a sentence-based chunking strategy that enables LLMs with shorter context windows to summarize extended inputs in multiple stages. The findings reveal that while LLMs perform competitively on news and dialog tasks, their performance on long scientific documents improves significantly when aided by chunking strategies. In addition, notable performance variations were observed based on model parameters, dataset properties, and prompt design. These results offer actionable insights into how different LLMs behave across task types, contributing to ongoing research in efficient, instruction-based NLP systems.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Mnemonic Generation for Kanji Learning via Expectation-Maximization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning Japanese vocabulary is a challenge for learners from Roman alphabet backgrounds due to script differences. Japanese combines syllabaries like hiragana with kanji, which are logographic characters of Chinese origin. Kanji are also complicated due to their complexity and volume. Keyword mnemonics are a common strategy to aid memorization, often using the compositional structure of kanji to form vivid associations. Despite recent efforts to use large language models (LLMs) to assist learners, existing methods for LLM-based keyword mnemonic generation function as a black box, offering limited interpretability. We propose a generative framework that explicitly models the mnemonic construction process as driven by a set of common rules, and learn them using a novel Expectation-Maximization-type algorithm. Trained on learner-authored mnemonics from an online platform, our method learns latent structures and compositional rules, enabling interpretable and systematic mnemonics generation. Experiments show that our method performs well in the cold-start setting for new learners while providing insight into the mechanisms behind effective mnemonic creation.</description>

      <title>OGF: An Online Gradient Flow Method for Optimizing the Statistical Steady-State Time Averages of Unsteady Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent flows are chaotic and unsteady, but their statistical distribution converges to a statistical steady state. Engineering quantities of interest typically take the form of time-average statistics such as $ \frac{1}{t} \int_0^t f ( u(x,\tau; \theta) ) d\tau \overset{t \rightarrow \infty}{\rightarrow} F(x; \theta)$, where $u(x,t; \theta)$ are solutions of the Navier--Stokes equations with parameters $\theta$. Optimizing over $F(x; \theta)$ has many engineering applications including geometric optimization, flow control, and closure modeling. However, this remains an open challenge, as existing computational approaches are incapable of scaling to physically representative numbers of grid points. The fundamental obstacle is the chaoticity of turbulent flows: gradients calculated with the adjoint method diverge exponentially as $t \rightarrow \infty$.
  We develop a new online gradient-flow (OGF) method that is scalable to large degree-of-freedom systems and enables optimizing for the steady-state statistics of chaotic, unsteady, turbulence-resolving simulations. The method forward-propagates an online estimate for the gradient of $F(x; \theta)$ while simultaneously performing online updates of the parameters $\theta$. A key feature is the fully online nature of the algorithm to facilitate faster optimization progress and its combination with a finite-difference estimator to avoid the divergence of gradients due to chaoticity. The proposed OGF method is demonstrated for optimizations over three chaotic ordinary and partial differential equations: the Lorenz-63 equation, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and Navier--Stokes solutions of compressible, forced, homogeneous isotropic turbulence. In each case, the OGF method successfully reduces the loss based on $F(x; \theta)$ by several orders of magnitude and accurately recovers the optimal parameters.</description>

      <title>Effects of Unplanned Incoming Flights on Airport Relief Processes after a Major Natural Disaster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The severity of natural disasters is increasing every year, impacting many people's lives. During the response phase of disasters, airports are important hubs where relief aid arrives and people need to be evacuated. However, the airport often forms a bottleneck in these relief operations due to the sudden need for increased capacity. Limited research has been done on the operational side of airport disaster management. Experts identify the main problems as, first, the asymmetry of information between the airport and incoming flights, and second, the lack of resources. The goal of this research is to understand the effects of incomplete knowledge of incoming flights with different resource allocation strategies on the performance of cargo handling operations at an airport after a natural disaster. An agent-based model is created, implementing realistic offloading strategies with different degrees of information uncertainty. Model calibration and verification are performed with experts in the field. The model performance is measured by the average turnaround time, which is divided into offloading time, boarding time, and cumulative waiting times. The results show that the effects of one unplanned aircraft are negligible. However, all waiting times increase with more arriving unplanned aircraft.</description>

      <title>AI Generated Text Detection Using Instruction Fine-tuned Large Language and Transformer-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess an extraordinary capability to produce text that is not only coherent and contextually relevant but also strikingly similar to human writing. They adapt to various styles and genres, producing content that is both grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. Recently, LLMs have been misused to create highly realistic phishing emails, spread fake news, generate code to automate cyber crime, and write fraudulent scientific articles. Additionally, in many real-world applications, the generated content including style and topic and the generator model are not known beforehand. The increasing prevalence and sophistication of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated texts have made their detection progressively more challenging. Various attempts have been made to distinguish machine-generated text from human-authored content using linguistic, statistical, machine learning, and ensemble-based approaches. This work focuses on two primary objectives Task-A, which involves distinguishing human-written text from machine-generated text, and Task-B, which attempts to identify the specific LLM model responsible for the generation. Both of these tasks are based on fine tuning of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT_4o-mini), Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) 3 8B, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). The fine-tuned version of GPT_4o-mini and the BERT model has achieved accuracies of 0.9547 for Task-A and 0.4698 for Task-B.</description>

      <title>LAID: Lightweight AI-Generated Image Detection in Spatial and Spectral Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent proliferation of photorealistic AI-generated images (AIGI) has raised urgent concerns about their potential misuse, particularly on social media platforms. Current state-of-the-art AIGI detection methods typically rely on large, deep neural architectures, creating significant computational barriers to real-time, large-scale deployment on platforms like social media. To challenge this reliance on computationally intensive models, we introduce LAID, the first framework -- to our knowledge -- that benchmarks and evaluates the detection performance and efficiency of off-the-shelf lightweight neural networks. In this framework, we comprehensively train and evaluate selected models on a representative subset of the GenImage dataset across spatial, spectral, and fusion image domains. Our results demonstrate that lightweight models can achieve competitive accuracy, even under adversarial conditions, while incurring substantially lower memory and computation costs compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This study offers valuable insight into the trade-off between efficiency and performance in AIGI detection and lays a foundation for the development of practical, scalable, and trustworthy detection systems. The source code of LAID can be found at: https://github.com/nchivar/LAID.</description>

      <title>Critiques of World Models</title>

Abstract: World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it. In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune, and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" in psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision learning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN) AGI system enabled by such a model.</description>

      <title>OpenS2S: Advancing Fully Open-Source End-to-End Empathetic Large Speech Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05177v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empathetic interaction is a cornerstone of human-machine communication, due to the need for understanding speech enriched with paralinguistic cues and generating emotional and expressive responses. However, the most powerful empathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about the architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the critical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior, we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM designed to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic speech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved decoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate end-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at low cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content and controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional variation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic diversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source OpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and fine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate innovation in empathetic speech systems.

      <title>CREW-WILDFIRE: Benchmarking Agentic Multi-Agent Collaborations at Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite rapid progress in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems, current benchmarks fall short in evaluating their scalability, robustness, and coordination capabilities in complex, dynamic, real-world tasks. Existing environments typically focus on small-scale, fully observable, or low-complexity domains, limiting their utility for developing and assessing next-generation multi-agent Agentic AI frameworks. We introduce CREW-Wildfire, an open-source benchmark designed to close this gap. Built atop the human-AI teaming CREW simulation platform, CREW-Wildfire offers procedurally generated wildfire response scenarios featuring large maps, heterogeneous agents, partial observability, stochastic dynamics, and long-horizon planning objectives. The environment supports both low-level control and high-level natural language interactions through modular Perception and Execution modules. We implement and evaluate several state-of-the-art LLM-based multi-agent Agentic AI frameworks, uncovering significant performance gaps that highlight the unsolved challenges in large-scale coordination, communication, spatial reasoning, and long-horizon planning under uncertainty. By providing more realistic complexity, scalable architecture, and behavioral evaluation metrics, CREW-Wildfire establishes a critical foundation for advancing research in scalable multi-agent Agentic intelligence. All code, environments, data, and baselines will be released to support future research in this emerging domain.</description>

      <title>Infrastructuring Contestability: A Framework for Community-Defined AI Value Pluralism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of AI-driven systems presents a fundamental challenge to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), often diminishing user agency and failing to account for value pluralism. Current approaches to value alignment, which rely on centralized, top-down definitions, lack the mechanisms for meaningful contestability. This leaves users and communities unable to challenge or shape the values embedded in the systems that govern their digital lives, creating a crisis of legitimacy and trust. This paper introduces Community-Defined AI Value Pluralism (CDAVP), a socio-technical framework that addresses this gap. It reframes the design problem from achieving a single aligned state to infrastructuring a dynamic ecosystem for value deliberation and application. At its core, CDAVP enables diverse, self-organizing communities to define and maintain explicit value profiles - rich, machine-readable representations that can encompass not only preferences but also community-specific rights and duties. These profiles are then contextually activated by the end-user, who retains ultimate control (agency) over which values guide the AI's behavior. AI applications, in turn, are designed to transparently interpret these profiles and moderate conflicts, adhering to a set of non-negotiable, democratically-legitimated meta-rules. The designer's role shifts from crafting static interfaces to becoming an architect of participatory ecosystems. We argue that infrastructuring for pluralism is a necessary pathway toward achieving robust algorithmic accountability and genuinely contestable, human-centric AI.</description>

      <title>Train-before-Test Harmonizes Language Model Rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing language model benchmarks provide contradictory model rankings, even for benchmarks that aim to capture similar skills. This dilemma of conflicting rankings hampers model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion to a growing ecosystem of competing models. Recent work attributed ranking disagreement to the phenomenon of training on the test task: As released, different models exhibit a different level of preparation for any given test task. A candidate solution to the problem is train-before-test: Give each model the same benchmark-specific finetuning before evaluation. Our primary contribution is a broad empirical evaluation of train-before-test across 24 benchmarks and 61 models. We show that train-before-test significantly improves ranking agreement consistently across all benchmarks. Whereas rankings have little external validity to start with, they enjoy a significant degree of external validity when applying train-before-test: Model rankings transfer gracefully from one benchmark to the other. Even within the same model family, train-before-test reduces strong ranking disagreement to near-perfect agreement. In addition, train-before-test reduces the model-score matrix to essentially rank one, revealing new insights into the latent factors of benchmark performance. Our work supports the recommendation to make train-before-test a default component of LLM benchmarking.</description>

      <title>EmbodieDreamer: Advancing Real2Sim2Real Transfer for Policy Training via Embodied World Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Embodied AI has led to an increasing demand for large-scale, high-quality real-world data. However, collecting such embodied data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner, a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap. It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74% compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by 89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning. Code, model and data will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>All in One: Visual-Description-Guided Unified Point Cloud Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unified segmentation of 3D point clouds is crucial for scene understanding, but is hindered by its sparse structure, limited annotations, and the challenge of distinguishing fine-grained object classes in complex environments. Existing methods often struggle to capture rich semantic and contextual information due to limited supervision and a lack of diverse multimodal cues, leading to suboptimal differentiation of classes and instances. To address these challenges, we propose VDG-Uni3DSeg, a novel framework that integrates pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) and large language models (LLMs) to enhance 3D segmentation. By leveraging LLM-generated textual descriptions and reference images from the internet, our method incorporates rich multimodal cues, facilitating fine-grained class and instance separation. We further design a Semantic-Visual Contrastive Loss to align point features with multimodal queries and a Spatial Enhanced Module to model scene-wide relationships efficiently. Operating within a closed-set paradigm that utilizes multimodal knowledge generated offline, VDG-Uni3DSeg achieves state-of-the-art results in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, offering a scalable and practical solution for 3D understanding. Our code is available at https://github.com/Hanzy1996/VDG-Uni3DSeg.</description>

      <title>CTA: Cross-Task Alignment for Better Test Time Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05221v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of computer vision tasks. However, their performance often degrades significantly when faced with distribution shifts, such as domain or dataset changes. Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as an effective method to enhance model robustness by incorporating an auxiliary unsupervised task during training and leveraging it for model updates at test time. In this work, we introduce CTA (Cross-Task Alignment), a novel approach for improving TTT. Unlike existing TTT methods, CTA does not require a specialized model architecture and instead takes inspiration from the success of multi-modal contrastive learning to align a supervised encoder with a self-supervised one. This process enforces alignment between the learned representations of both models, thereby mitigating the risk of gradient interference, preserving the intrinsic robustness of self-supervised learning and enabling more semantically meaningful updates at test-time. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in robustness and generalization over the state-of-the-art on several benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Action Space Reduction Strategies for Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework for autonomous driving by enabling agents to learn control policies through interaction with environments. However, large and high-dimensional action spaces often used to support fine-grained control can impede training efficiency and increase exploration costs. In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel structured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving: dynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are systematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space baselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our framework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that processes both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed dynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on context and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating invalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse driving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves training stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in particular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control precision, and generalization. These findings highlight the importance of context-aware action space design for scalable and reliable RL in autonomous driving tasks.</description>

      <title>From Marginal to Joint Predictions: Evaluating Scene-Consistent Trajectory Prediction Approaches for Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for the safe and efficient operation of automated vehicles in dynamic environments. Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work, we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction, including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and limitations of each approach. Several prediction examples are available at https://frommarginaltojointpred.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Memory in LLM Agents via Incremental Multi-Turn Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on evaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another critical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and retrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of benchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this paper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict resolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally accumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four competencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated existing datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory competencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies, underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms for LLM agents.</description>

      <title>A Data-Transparent Probabilistic Model of Temporal Propositional Abstraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard probabilistic models face fundamental challenges such as data scarcity, a large hypothesis space, and poor data transparency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel probabilistic model of data-driven temporal propositional reasoning. Unlike conventional probabilistic models where data is a product of domain knowledge encoded in the probabilistic model, we explore the reverse direction where domain knowledge is a product of data encoded in the probabilistic model. This more data-driven perspective suggests no distinction between maximum likelihood parameter learning and temporal propositional reasoning. We show that our probabilistic model is equivalent to a highest-order, i.e., full-memory, Markov chain, and our model requires no distinction between hidden and observable variables. We discuss that limits provide a natural and mathematically rigorous way to handle data scarcity, including the zero-frequency problem. We also discuss that a probability distribution over data generated by our probabilistic model helps data transparency by revealing influential data used in predictions. The reproducibility of this theoretical work is fully demonstrated by the included proofs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10448v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When working with generative artificial intelligence (AI), users may see productivity gains, but the AI-generated content may not match their preferences exactly. To study this effect, we introduce a Bayesian framework in which heterogeneous users choose how much information to share with the AI, facing a trade-off between output fidelity and communication cost. We show that the interplay between these individual-level decisions and AI training may lead to societal challenges. Outputs may become more homogenized, especially when the AI is trained on AI-generated content, potentially triggering a homogenization death spiral. And any AI bias may propagate to become societal bias. A solution to the homogenization and bias issues is to reduce human-AI interaction frictions and enable users to flexibly share information, leading to personalized outputs without sacrificing productivity.</description>

      <title>Constrain Alignment with Sparse Autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences remains a key challenge. While post-training techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have achieved notable success, they often introduce computational inefficiencies and training instability. In this paper, we propose Feature-level constrained Preference Optimization (FPO), a novel method designed to simplify the alignment process while ensuring stability. FPO leverages pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduces feature-level constraints, allowing for efficient, sparsity-enforced alignment. Our approach enjoys efficiency by using sparse features activated in a well-trained sparse autoencoder and the quality of sequential KL divergence by using the feature-level offline reference. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FPO achieves a 5.08% absolute improvement in win rate with much lower computational cost compared to state-of-the-art baselines, making it a promising solution for efficient and controllable LLM alignments.</description>

      <title>A Causal World Model Underlying Next Token Prediction: Exploring GPT in a Controlled Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07446v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Are generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, trained only to predict the next token, implicitly learning a world model from which sequences are generated one token at a time? We address this question by deriving a causal interpretation of the attention mechanism in GPT and presenting a causal world model that arises from this interpretation. Furthermore, we propose that GPT models, at inference time, can be utilized for zero-shot causal structure learning for input sequences, and introduce a corresponding confidence score. Empirical tests were conducted in controlled environments using the setups of the Othello and Chess strategy games. A GPT, pre-trained on real-world games played with the intention of winning, was tested on out-of-distribution synthetic data consisting of sequences of random legal moves. We find that the GPT model is likely to generate legal next moves for out-of-distribution sequences for which a causal structure is encoded in the attention mechanism with high confidence. In cases where it generates illegal moves, it also fails to capture a causal structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper compares Julia reduction and hyperbolic reduction with the aim of finding equivalent binary forms with minimal coefficients. We demonstrate that hyperbolic reduction generally outperforms Julia reduction, particularly in the cases of sextics and decimics, though neither method guarantees achieving the minimal form. We further propose an additional shift and scaling to approximate the minimal form more closely. Finally, we introduce a machine learning framework to identify optimal transformations that minimize the heights of binary forms. This study provides new insights into the geometry and algebra of binary forms and highlights the potential of AI in advancing symbolic computation and reduction techniques. The findings, supported by extensive computational experiments, lay the groundwork for hybrid approaches that integrate traditional reduction methods with data-driven techniques.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for planning. However, unlike Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-whose performance naturally improves with inference-time computation scaling-standard diffusion-based planners offer only limited avenues for the scalability. In this paper, we introduce Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD), a novel framework that integrates the generative strength of diffusion models with the adaptive search capabilities of MCTS. Our method reconceptualizes denoising as a tree-structured process, allowing partially denoised plans to be iteratively evaluated, pruned, and refined. By selectively expanding promising trajectories while retaining the flexibility to revisit and improve suboptimal branches, MCTD achieves the benefits of MCTS such as controlling exploration-exploitation trade-offs within the diffusion framework. Empirical results on challenging long-horizon tasks show that MCTD outperforms diffusion baselines, yielding higher-quality solutions as inference-time computation increases.</description>

Abstract: Content analysis breaks down complex and unstructured texts into theory-informed numerical categories. Particularly, in social science, this process usually relies on multiple rounds of manual annotation, domain expert discussion, and rule-based refinement. In this paper, we introduce SCALE, a novel multi-agent framework that effectively $\underline{\textbf{S}}$imulates $\underline{\textbf{C}}$ontent $\underline{\textbf{A}}$nalysis via $\underline{\textbf{L}}$arge language model (LLM) ag$\underline{\textbf{E}}$nts. SCALE imitates key phases of content analysis, including text coding, collaborative discussion, and dynamic codebook evolution, capturing the reflective depth and adaptive discussions of human researchers. Furthermore, by integrating diverse modes of human intervention, SCALE is augmented with expert input to further enhance its performance. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that SCALE achieves human-approximated performance across various complex content analysis tasks, offering an innovative potential for future social science research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current state of modern web interfaces, especially in regards to accessibility focused usage is extremely lacking. Traditional methods for web interaction, such as scripting languages and screen readers, often lack the flexibility to handle dynamic content or the intelligence to interpret high-level user goals. To address these limitations, we introduce WebNav, a novel agent for multi-modal web navigation. WebNav leverages a dual Large Language Model (LLM) architecture to translate natural language commands into precise, executable actions on a graphical user interface. The system combines vision-based context from screenshots with a dynamic DOM-labeling browser extension to robustly identify interactive elements. A high-level 'Controller' LLM strategizes the next step toward a user's goal, while a second 'Assistant' LLM generates the exact parameters for execution. This separation of concerns allows for sophisticated task decomposition and action formulation. Our work presents the complete architecture and implementation of WebNav, demonstrating a promising approach to creating more intelligent web automation agents.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning under State and Outcome Uncertainty: A Foundational Distributional Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many real-world planning tasks, agents must tackle uncertainty about the environment's state and variability in the outcomes of any chosen policy. We address both forms of uncertainty as a first step toward safer algorithms in partially observable settings. Specifically, we extend Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DistRL)-which models the entire return distribution for fully observable domains-to Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), allowing an agent to learn the distribution of returns for each conditional plan. Concretely, we introduce new distributional Bellman operators for partial observability and prove their convergence under the supremum p-Wasserstein metric. We also propose a finite representation of these return distributions via psi-vectors, generalizing the classical alpha-vectors in POMDP solvers. Building on this, we develop Distributional Point-Based Value Iteration (DPBVI), which integrates psi-vectors into a standard point-based backup procedure-bridging DistRL and POMDP planning. By tracking return distributions, DPBVI naturally enables risk-sensitive control in domains where rare, high-impact events must be carefully managed. We provide source code to foster further research in robust decision-making under partial observability.</description>

      <title>Follow the STARs: Dynamic $\omega$-Regular Shielding of Learned Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel dynamic post-shielding framework that enforces the full class of $\omega$-regular correctness properties over pre-computed probabilistic policies. This constitutes a paradigm shift from the predominant setting of safety-shielding -- i.e., ensuring that nothing bad ever happens -- to a shielding process that additionally enforces liveness -- i.e., ensures that something good eventually happens. At the core, our method uses Strategy-Template-based Adaptive Runtime Shields (STARs), which leverage permissive strategy templates to enable post-shielding with minimal interference. As its main feature, STARs introduce a mechanism to dynamically control interference, allowing a tunable enforcement parameter to balance formal obligations and task-specific behavior at runtime. This allows to trigger more aggressive enforcement when needed, while allowing for optimized policy choices otherwise. In addition, STARs support runtime adaptation to changing specifications or actuator failures, making them especially suited for cyber-physical applications. We evaluate STARs on a mobile robot benchmark to demonstrate their controllable interference when enforcing (incrementally updated) $\omega$-regular correctness properties over learned probabilistic policies.</description>

      <title>OpenAg: Democratizing Agricultural Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agriculture is undergoing a major transformation driven by artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and knowledge representation technologies. However, current agricultural intelligence systems often lack contextual understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder farmers with limited resources. General-purpose large language models (LLMs), while powerful, typically lack the domain-specific knowledge and contextual reasoning needed for practical decision support in farming. They tend to produce recommendations that are too generic or unrealistic for real-world applications. To address these challenges, we present OpenAg, a comprehensive framework designed to advance agricultural artificial general intelligence (AGI). OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer learning to deliver context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights. The system includes: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base that integrates scientific literature, sensor data, and farmer-generated knowledge; (ii) a neural agricultural knowledge graph for structured reasoning and inference; (iii) an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system where AI agents specialize and collaborate across agricultural domains; and (iv) a causal transparency mechanism that ensures AI recommendations are interpretable, scientifically grounded, and aligned with real-world constraints. OpenAg aims to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and the tacit expertise of experienced farmers to support scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.</description>

      <title>Fast Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion: 100x Speedup via Parallel Sparse Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful approach for trajectory planning. However, their inherently non-sequential nature limits their effectiveness in long-horizon reasoning tasks at test time. The recently proposed Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) offers a promising solution by combining diffusion with tree-based search, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex planning problems. Despite its strengths, our analysis shows that MCTD incurs substantial computational overhead due to the sequential nature of tree search and the cost of iterative denoising. To address this, we propose Fast-MCTD, a more efficient variant that preserves the strengths of MCTD while significantly improving its speed and scalability. Fast-MCTD integrates two techniques: Parallel MCTD, which enables parallel rollouts via delayed tree updates and redundancy-aware selection; and Sparse MCTD, which reduces rollout length through trajectory coarsening. Experiments show that Fast-MCTD achieves up to 100x speedup over standard MCTD while maintaining or improving planning performance. Remarkably, it even outperforms Diffuser in inference speed on some tasks, despite Diffuser requiring no search and yielding weaker solutions. These results position Fast-MCTD as a practical and scalable solution for diffusion-based inference-time reasoning.</description>

      <title>RAG+: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Application-Aware Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and task-specific reasoning. In this work, we introduce RAG+, a principled and modular extension that explicitly incorporates application-aware reasoning into the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to access relevant information but also to apply it within structured, goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+ consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval with actionable application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded framework for knowledge integration, representing a step toward more interpretable and capable LLMs.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Assistants for the Semiconductor Failure Analysis with LLM-Based Planning Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process. The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as the number of deployed AI models increases, the challenge lies in orchestrating these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly integrate with the FA process.
  This paper investigates the design and implementation of a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist FA engineers in solving their analysis cases. The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and external tool utilization, enabling autonomous processing of complex queries, retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of human-readable responses. Evaluation results demonstrate the agent's operational effectiveness and reliability in supporting FA tasks.</description>

      <title>Graphs Meet AI Agents: Taxonomy, Progress, and Future Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI agents have experienced a paradigm shift, from early dominance by reinforcement learning (RL) to the rise of agents powered by large language models (LLMs), and now further advancing towards a synergistic fusion of RL and LLM capabilities. This progression has endowed AI agents with increasingly strong abilities. Despite these advances, to accomplish complex real-world tasks, agents are required to plan and execute effectively, maintain reliable memory, and coordinate smoothly with other agents. Achieving these capabilities involves contending with ever-present intricate information, operations, and interactions. In light of this challenge, data structurization can play a promising role by transforming intricate and disorganized data into well-structured forms that agents can more effectively understand and process. In this context, graphs, with their natural advantage in organizing, managing, and harnessing intricate data relationships, present a powerful data paradigm for structurization to support the capabilities demanded by advanced AI agents. To this end, this survey presents a first systematic review of how graphs can empower AI agents. Specifically, we explore the integration of graph techniques with core agent functionalities, highlight notable applications, and identify prospective avenues for future research. By comprehensively surveying this burgeoning intersection, we hope to inspire the development of next-generation AI agents equipped to tackle increasingly sophisticated challenges with graphs. Related resources are collected and continuously updated for the community in the Github link.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce jina-embeddings-v4, a 3.8 billion parameter multimodal embedding model that unifies text and image representations through a novel architecture supporting both single-vector and multi-vector embeddings in the late interaction style. The model incorporates task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters to optimize performance across diverse retrieval scenarios, including query-document retrieval, semantic text similarity, and code search. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that jina-embeddings-v4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-modal and cross-modal retrieval tasks, with particular strength in processing visually rich content such as tables, charts, diagrams, and mixed-media formats. To facilitate evaluation of this capability, we also introduce Jina-VDR, a novel benchmark specifically designed for visually rich image retrieval.</description>

      <title>KnowRL: Exploring Knowledgeable Reinforcement Learning for Factuality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowRL.</description>

      <title>Embodied AI Agents: Modeling the World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes our research on AI agents embodied in visual, virtual or physical forms, enabling them to interact with both users and their environments. These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices, and robots, are designed to perceive, learn and act within their surroundings, which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents, allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical world. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world model of users to enable better human-agent collaboration.</description>

      <title>Improving Rationality in the Reasoning Process of Language Models through Self-playing Game</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable reasoning abilities in various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, recent studies indicate that even the best models lack true comprehension of their reasoning processes. In this paper, we explore how self-play can enhance the rationality of models in the reasoning process without supervision from humans or superior models. We design a Critic-Discernment Game(CDG) in which a prover first provides a solution to a given problem and is subsequently challenged by critiques of its solution. These critiques either aim to assist or mislead the prover. The objective of the prover is to maintain the correct answer when faced with misleading comments, while correcting errors in response to constructive feedback. Our experiments on tasks involving mathematical reasoning, stepwise error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning demonstrate that CDG training can significantly improve the ability of well-aligned LLMs to comprehend their reasoning process.</description>

      <title>SEZ-HARN: Self-Explainable Zero-shot Human Activity Recognition Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR), which uses data from Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, has many practical applications in healthcare and assisted living environments. However, its use in real-world scenarios has been limited by the lack of comprehensive IMU-based HAR datasets that cover a wide range of activities and the lack of transparency in existing HAR models. Zero-shot HAR (ZS-HAR) overcomes the data limitations, but current models struggle to explain their decisions, making them less transparent. This paper introduces a novel IMU-based ZS-HAR model called the Self-Explainable Zero-shot Human Activity Recognition Network (SEZ-HARN). It can recognize activities not encountered during training and provide skeleton videos to explain its decision-making process. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SEZ-HARN on four benchmark datasets PAMAP2, DaLiAc, HTD-MHAD and MHealth and compare its performance against three state-of-the-art black-box ZS-HAR models. The experiment results demonstrate that SEZ-HARN produces realistic and understandable explanations while achieving competitive Zero-shot recognition accuracy. SEZ-HARN achieves a Zero-shot prediction accuracy within 3\% of the best-performing black-box model on PAMAP2 while maintaining comparable performance on the other three datasets.</description>

      <title>Pensieve Grader: An AI-Powered, Ready-to-Use Platform for Effortless Handwritten STEM Grading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grading handwritten, open-ended responses remains a major bottleneck in large university STEM courses. We introduce Pensieve (https://www.pensieve.co), an AI-assisted grading platform that leverages large language models (LLMs) to transcribe and evaluate student work, providing instructors with rubric-aligned scores, transcriptions, and confidence ratings. Unlike prior tools that focus narrowly on specific tasks like transcription or rubric generation, Pensieve supports the entire grading pipeline-from scanned student submissions to final feedback-within a human-in-the-loop interface.
  Pensieve has been deployed in real-world courses at over 20 institutions and has graded more than 300,000 student responses. We present system details and empirical results across four core STEM disciplines: Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. Our findings show that Pensieve reduces grading time by an average of 65%, while maintaining a 95.4% agreement rate with instructor-assigned grades for high-confidence predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge. In this work, using an independent multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting, different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this approach. As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.</description>

      <title>Detection of Disengagement from Voluntary Quizzes: An Explainable Machine Learning Approach in Higher Distance Education</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Students disengaging from their tasks can have serious long-term consequences, including academic drop-out. This is particularly relevant for students in distance education. One way to measure the level of disengagement in distance education is to observe participation in non-mandatory exercises in different online courses. In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the non-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based university. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that could be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning algorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction accuracy. Using the SHAP method, we developed an explainable machine learning framework that allows practitioners to better understand the decisions of the trained algorithm. The experimental results show a balanced accuracy of 91\%, where about 85\% of disengaged students were correctly detected. On top of the highly predictive performance and explainable framework, we provide a discussion on how to design a timely intervention to minimise disengagement from voluntary tasks in online learning.</description>

      <title>KERAP: A Knowledge-Enhanced Reasoning Approach for Accurate Zero-shot Diagnosis Prediction Using Multi-agent LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and personalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.04160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the recent years, generation of data have escalated to extensive dimensions and big data has emerged as a propelling force in the development of various machine learning advances and internet-of-things (IoT) devices. In this regard, the analytical and learning tools that transport data from several sources to a central cloud for its processing, training, and storage enable realization of the potential of big data. Nevertheless, since the data may contain sensitive information like banking account information, government information, and personal information, these traditional techniques often raise serious privacy concerns. To overcome such challenges, Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a sub-field of machine learning that focuses on scenarios where several entities (commonly termed as clients) work together to train a model while maintaining the decentralisation of their data. Although enormous efforts have been channelized for such studies, there still exists a gap in the literature wherein an extensive review of FL in the realm of big data services remains unexplored. The present paper thus emphasizes on the use of FL in handling big data and related services which encompasses comprehensive review of the potential of FL in big data acquisition, storage, big data analytics and further privacy preservation. Subsequently, the potential of FL in big data applications, such as smart city, smart healthcare, smart transportation, smart grid, and social media are also explored. The paper also highlights various projects pertaining to FL-big data and discusses the associated challenges related to such implementations. This acts as a direction of further research encouraging the development of plausible solutions.</description>

      <title>Normality-Guided Distributional Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13125v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning a predictive model of the mean return, or value function, plays a critical role in many reinforcement learning algorithms. Distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) has been shown to improve performance by modeling the value distribution, not just the mean. We study the value distribution in several continuous control tasks and find that the learned value distribution is empirically quite close to normal. We design a method that exploits this property, employing variances predicted from a variance network, along with returns, to analytically compute target quantile bars representing a normal for our distributional value function. In addition, we propose a policy update strategy based on the correctness as measured by structural characteristics of the value distribution not present in the standard value function. The approach we outline is compatible with many DRL structures. We use two representative on-policy algorithms, PPO and TRPO, as testbeds. Our method yields statistically significant improvements in 10 out of 16 continuous task settings, while utilizing a reduced number of weights and achieving faster training time compared to an ensemble-based method for quantifying value distribution uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Relation-Aware Network with Attention-Based Loss for Few-Shot Knowledge Graph Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC) task aims to predict unseen facts of a relation with few-shot reference entity pairs. Current approaches randomly select one negative sample for each reference entity pair to minimize a margin-based ranking loss, which easily leads to a zero-loss problem if the negative sample is far away from the positive sample and then out of the margin. Moreover, the entity should have a different representation under a different context. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Relation-Aware Network with Attention-Based Loss (RANA) framework. Specifically, to better utilize the plentiful negative samples and alleviate the zero-loss issue, we strategically select relevant negative samples and design an attention-based loss function to further differentiate the importance of each negative sample. The intuition is that negative samples more similar to positive samples will contribute more to the model. Further, we design a dynamic relation-aware entity encoder for learning a context-dependent entity representation. Experiments demonstrate that RANA outperforms the state-of-the-art models on two benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Learning Differentiable Logic Programs for Abstract Visual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual reasoning is essential for building intelligent agents that understand the world and perform problem-solving beyond perception. Differentiable forward reasoning has been developed to integrate reasoning with gradient-based machine learning paradigms. However, due to the memory intensity, most existing approaches do not bring the best of the expressivity of first-order logic, excluding a crucial ability to solve abstract visual reasoning, where agents need to perform reasoning by using analogies on abstract concepts in different scenarios. To overcome this problem, we propose NEUro-symbolic Message-pAssiNg reasoNer (NEUMANN), which is a graph-based differentiable forward reasoner, passing messages in a memory-efficient manner and handling structured programs with functors. Moreover, we propose a computationally-efficient structure learning algorithm to perform explanatory program induction on complex visual scenes. To evaluate, in addition to conventional visual reasoning tasks, we propose a new task, visual reasoning behind-the-scenes, where agents need to learn abstract programs and then answer queries by imagining scenes that are not observed. We empirically demonstrate that NEUMANN solves visual reasoning tasks efficiently, outperforming neural, symbolic, and neuro-symbolic baselines.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Evaluation for Low-Latency Simultaneous Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03415v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The challenge of low-latency speech translation has recently draw significant interest in the research community as shown by several publications and shared tasks. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate these different approaches in realistic scenarios. However, currently only specific aspects of the systems are evaluated and often it is not possible to compare different approaches.
  In this work, we propose the first framework to perform and evaluate the various aspects of low-latency speech translation under realistic conditions. The evaluation is carried out in an end-to-end fashion. This includes the segmentation of the audio as well as the run-time of the different components.
  Secondly, we compare different approaches to low-latency speech translation using this framework. We evaluate models with the option to revise the output as well as methods with fixed output. Furthermore, we directly compare state-of-the-art cascaded as well as end-to-end systems. Finally, the framework allows to automatically evaluate the translation quality as well as latency and also provides a web interface to show the low-latency model outputs to the user.</description>

      <title>Phase codes emerge in recurrent neural networks optimized for modular arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can implement complex computations by leveraging a range of dynamics, such as oscillations, attractors, and transient trajectories. A growing body of work has highlighted the emergence of phase codes, a type of oscillatory activity where information is encoded in the relative phase of network activity, in RNNs trained for working memory tasks. However, these studies rely on architectural constraints or regularization schemes that explicitly promote oscillatory solutions. Here, we investigate whether phase coding can emerge purely from task optimization by training continuous-time RNNs to perform a simple modular arithmetic task without oscillatory-promoting biases. We find that in the absence of such biases, RNNs can learn phase code solutions. Surprisingly, we also uncover a rich diversity of alternative solutions that solve our modular arithmetic task via qualitatively distinct dynamics and dynamical mechanisms. We map the solution space for our task and show that the phase code solution occupies a distinct region. These results suggest that phase coding can be a natural but not inevitable outcome of training RNNs on modular arithmetic, and highlight the diversity of solutions RNNs can learn to solve simple tasks.</description>

      <title>AVTENet: A Human-Cognition-Inspired Audio-Visual Transformer-Based Ensemble Network for Video Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent proliferation of hyper-realistic deepfake videos has drawn attention to the threat of audio and visual forgeries. Most previous studies on detecting artificial intelligence-generated fake videos only utilize visual modality or audio modality. While some methods exploit audio and visual modalities to detect forged videos, they have not been comprehensively evaluated on multimodal datasets of deepfake videos involving acoustic and visual manipulations, and are mostly based on convolutional neural networks with low detection accuracy. Considering that human cognition instinctively integrates multisensory information including audio and visual cues to perceive and interpret content and the success of transformer in various fields, this study introduces the audio-visual transformer-based ensemble network (AVTENet). This innovative framework tackles the complexities of deepfake technology by integrating both acoustic and visual manipulations to enhance the accuracy of video forgery detection. Specifically, the proposed model integrates several purely transformer-based variants that capture video, audio, and audio-visual salient cues to reach a consensus in prediction. For evaluation, we use the recently released benchmark multimodal audio-video FakeAVCeleb dataset. For a detailed analysis, we evaluate AVTENet, its variants, and several existing methods on multiple test sets of the FakeAVCeleb dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms all existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on Testset-I and Testset-II of the FakeAVCeleb dataset. We also compare AVTENet against humans in detecting video forgery. The results show that AVTENet significantly outperforms humans.</description>

      <title>Towards Better Visualizing the Decision Basis of Networks via Unfold and Conquer Attribution Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Revealing the transparency of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has been widely studied to describe the decision mechanisms of network inner structures. In this paper, we propose a novel post-hoc framework, Unfold and Conquer Attribution Guidance (UCAG), which enhances the explainability of the network decision by spatially scrutinizing the input features with respect to the model confidence. Addressing the phenomenon of missing detailed descriptions, UCAG sequentially complies with the confidence of slices of the image, leading to providing an abundant and clear interpretation. Therefore, it is possible to enhance the representation ability of explanation by preserving the detailed descriptions of assistant input features, which are commonly overwhelmed by the main meaningful regions. We conduct numerous evaluations to validate the performance in several metrics: i) deletion and insertion, ii) (energy-based) pointing games, and iii) positive and negative density maps. Experimental results, including qualitative comparisons, demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing methods with the nature of clear and detailed explanations and applicability.</description>

      <title>GhostWriter: Augmenting Collaborative Human-AI Writing Experiences Through Personalization and Agency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in providing different forms of writing assistance to different writers. However, LLM-powered writing systems often fall short in capturing the nuanced personalization and control needed to effectively support users -- particularly for those who lack experience with prompt engineering. To address these challenges, we introduce GhostWriter, an AI-enhanced design probe that enables users to exercise enhanced agency and personalization during writing. GhostWriter leverages LLMs to implicitly learn the user's intended writing style for seamless personalization, while exposing explicit teaching moments for style refinement and reflection. We study 18 participants who use GhostWriter on two distinct writing tasks, observing that it helps users craft personalized text generations and empowers them by providing multiple ways to control the system's writing style. Based on this study, we present insights on how specific design choices can promote greater user agency in AI-assisted writing and discuss people's evolving relationships with such systems. We conclude by offering design recommendations for future work.</description>

      <title>PIP-Net: Pedestrian Intention Prediction in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12810v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate pedestrian intention prediction (PIP) by Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is one of the current research challenges in this field. In this article, we introduce PIP-Net, a novel framework designed to predict pedestrian crossing intentions by AVs in real-world urban scenarios. We offer two variants of PIP-Net designed for different camera mounts and setups. Leveraging both kinematic data and spatial features from the driving scene, the proposed model employs a recurrent and temporal attention-based solution, outperforming state-of-the-art performance. To enhance the visual representation of road users and their proximity to the ego vehicle, we introduce a categorical depth feature map, combined with a local motion flow feature, providing rich insights into the scene dynamics. Additionally, we explore the impact of expanding the camera's field of view, from one to three cameras surrounding the ego vehicle, leading to an enhancement in the model's contextual perception. Depending on the traffic scenario and road environment, the model excels in predicting pedestrian crossing intentions up to 4 seconds in advance, which is a breakthrough in current research studies in pedestrian intention prediction. Finally, for the first time, we present the Urban-PIP dataset, a customised pedestrian intention prediction dataset, with multi-camera annotations in real-world automated driving scenarios.</description>

      <title>VGMShield: Mitigating Misuse of Video Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement in video generation, people can conveniently use video generation models to create videos tailored to their specific desires. As a result, there are also growing concerns about the potential misuse of video generation for spreading illegal content and misinformation.
  In this work, we introduce VGMShield: a set of straightforward but effective mitigations through the lifecycle of fake video generation. We start from fake video detection, trying to understand whether there is uniqueness in generated videos and whether we can differentiate them from real videos; then, we investigate the fake video source tracing problem, which maps a fake video back to the model that generated it. Towards these, we propose to leverage pre-trained models that focus on spatial-temporal dynamics as the backbone to identify inconsistencies in videos. In detail, we analyze fake videos from the perspective of the generation process. Based on the observation of attention shifts, motion variations, and frequency fluctuations, we identify common patterns in the generated video. These patterns serve as the foundation for our experiments on fake video detection and source tracing.
  Through experiments on seven state-of-the-art open-source models, we demonstrate that current models still cannot reliably reproduce spatial-temporal relationships, and thus, we can accomplish detection and source tracing with over 90% accuracy.
  Furthermore, anticipating future generative model improvements, we propose a prevention method that adds invisible perturbations to the query images to make the generated videos look unreal. Together with detection and tracing, our multi-faceted set of solutions can effectively mitigate misuse of video generative models.</description>

      <title>Do You Trust Your Model? Emerging Malware Threats in the Deep Learning Ecosystem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training high-quality deep learning models is a challenging task due to computational and technical requirements. A growing number of individuals, institutions, and companies increasingly rely on pre-trained, third-party models made available in public repositories. These models are often used directly or integrated in product pipelines with no particular precautions, since they are effectively just data in tensor form and considered safe. In this paper, we raise awareness of a new machine learning supply chain threat targeting neural networks. We introduce MaleficNet 2.0, a novel technique to embed self-extracting, self-executing malware in neural networks. MaleficNet 2.0 uses spread-spectrum channel coding combined with error correction techniques to inject malicious payloads in the parameters of deep neural networks. MaleficNet 2.0 injection technique is stealthy, does not degrade the performance of the model, and is robust against removal techniques. We design our approach to work both in traditional and distributed learning settings such as Federated Learning, and demonstrate that it is effective even when a reduced number of bits is used for the model parameters. Finally, we implement a proof-of-concept self-extracting neural network malware using MaleficNet 2.0, demonstrating the practicality of the attack against a widely adopted machine learning framework. Our aim with this work is to raise awareness against these new, dangerous attacks both in the research community and industry, and we hope to encourage further research in mitigation techniques against such threats.</description>

      <title>Self-Rectifying Diffusion Sampling with Perturbed-Attention Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that diffusion models are capable of generating high-quality samples, but their quality heavily depends on sampling guidance techniques, such as classifier guidance (CG) and classifier-free guidance (CFG). These techniques are often not applicable in unconditional generation or in various downstream tasks such as image restoration. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling guidance, called Perturbed-Attention Guidance (PAG), which improves diffusion sample quality across both unconditional and conditional settings, achieving this without requiring additional training or the integration of external modules. PAG is designed to progressively enhance the structure of samples throughout the denoising process. It involves generating intermediate samples with degraded structure by substituting selected self-attention maps in diffusion U-Net with an identity matrix, by considering the self-attention mechanisms' ability to capture structural information, and guiding the denoising process away from these degraded samples. In both ADM and Stable Diffusion, PAG surprisingly improves sample quality in conditional and even unconditional scenarios. Moreover, PAG significantly improves the baseline performance in various downstream tasks where existing guidances such as CG or CFG cannot be fully utilized, including ControlNet with empty prompts and image restoration such as inpainting and deblurring.</description>

      <title>Is Your AI Truly Yours? Leveraging Blockchain for Copyrights, Provenance, and Lineage</title>

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrates into diverse areas, particularly in content generation, ensuring rightful ownership and ethical use becomes paramount, AI service providers are expected to prioritize responsibly sourcing training data and obtaining licenses from data owners. However, existing studies primarily center on safeguarding static copyrights, which simply treat metadata/datasets as non-fungible items with transferable/trading capabilities, neglecting the dynamic nature of training procedures that can shape an ongoing trajectory. In this paper, we present \textsc{IBis}, a blockchain-based framework tailored for AI model training workflows. Our design can dynamically manage copyright compliance and data provenance in decentralized AI model training processes, ensuring that intellectual property rights are respected throughout iterative model enhancements and licensing updates. Technically, \textsc{IBis} integrates on-chain registries for datasets, licenses and models, alongside off-chain signing services to facilitate collaboration among multiple participants. Further, \textsc{IBis} provides APIs designed for seamless integration with existing contract management software, minimizing disruptions to established model training processes. We implement \textsc{IBis} using Daml on the Canton blockchain. Evaluation results showcase the feasibility and scalability of \textsc{IBis} across varying numbers of users, datasets, models, and licenses.</description>

      <title>ST-LoRA: Low-rank Adaptation for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is essential for understanding future dynamics within real-world systems by leveraging historical data from multiple locations. Existing methods often prioritize the development of intricate neural networks to capture the complex dependencies of the data. These methods neglect node-level heterogeneity and face over-parameterization when attempting to model node-specific characteristics. In this paper, we present a novel low-rank adaptation framework for existing spatio-temporal prediction models, termed \model, which alleviates the aforementioned problems through node-level adjustments. Specifically, we introduce the node-adaptive low-rank layer and node-specific predictor, capturing the complex functional characteristics of nodes while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently achieves superior performance across various forecasting models with minimal computational overhead, improving performance by 7% with only 1% additional parameter cost.

      <title>A Survey of Large Language Models on Generative Graph Analytics: Query, Learning, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph is a fundamental data model to represent various entities and their complex relationships in society and nature, such as social networks, transportation networks, and financial networks. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have showcased a strong generalization ability to handle various natural language processing tasks to answer users' arbitrary questions and generate specific-domain content. Compared with graph learning models, LLMs enjoy superior advantages in addressing the challenges of generalizing graph tasks by eliminating the need for training graph learning models and reducing the cost of manual annotation. However, LLMs are sequential models for textual data, but graphs are non-sequential topological data. It is challenging to adapt LLMs to tackle graph analytics tasks. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of existing LLM studies on graph data, which summarizes the relevant graph analytics tasks solved by advanced LLM models and points out the existing challenges and future directions. Specifically, we study the key problems of LLM-based generative graph analytics (LLM-GGA) in terms of three categories: LLM-based graph query processing (LLM-GQP), LLM-based graph inference and learning (LLM-GIL), and graph-LLM-based applications. LLM-GQP focuses on an integration of graph analytics techniques and LLM prompts, including graph understanding and knowledge graphs and LLMs, while LLM-GIL focuses on learning and reasoning over graphs, including graph learning, graph-formed reasoning, and graph representation. We summarize the useful prompts incorporated into LLM to handle different graph downstream tasks. Moreover, we give a summary of LLM model evaluation, benchmark datasets/tasks, and a deep pro and cons analysis of the discussed LLM-GGA models. We also explore open problems and future directions in the research area of LLMs and graph analytics.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Aligned Federated Learning (CAFe): Harmonizing Loss Landscapes for Fairness Without Demographics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19725v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training, making it well-suited for decentralized human-sensing applications. Ensuring fairness in FL is challenging, as current methods rely on sensitive attribute knowledge, which conflicts with FL's privacy principles. Additionally, sensitive attributes in human-sensing data may be unknown or latent. To address this, we introduce Curvature-Aligned Federated Learning (CAFe), a theoretically grounded approach that achieves fairness in FL without requiring sensitive attribute knowledge, a concept termed "Fairness without Demographics" (FWD). CAFe introduces loss-landscape curvature regularization during local training and clients' loss-landscape sharpness-aware aggregation to align curvature both within and across clients, enabling a strong balance between higher fairness and performance. CAFe is especially suitable for real-world human-sensing FL scenarios involving single or multi-user edge devices with unknown or multiple bias factors. We validated CAFe through theoretical and empirical justifications, and comprehensive evaluations using three real-world datasets and a live real-world FL deployment with a heterogeneous testbed of resource-constrained devices. Additionally, we conduct sensitivity analyses on local training data volume, client sampling, communication overhead, resource costs, and runtime performance to demonstrate its feasibility for practical FL edge device deployment.</description>

      <title>Elements of World Knowledge (EWoK): A Cognition-Inspired Framework for Evaluating Basic World Knowledge in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to build and reason about models of the world is essential for situated language understanding. But evaluating world modeling capabilities in modern AI systems -- especially those based on language models -- has proven challenging, in large part because of the difficulty of disentangling conceptual knowledge about the world from knowledge of surface co-occurrence statistics. This paper presents Elements of World Knowledge (EWoK), a framework for evaluating language models' understanding of the conceptual knowledge underlying world modeling. EWoK targets specific concepts from multiple knowledge domains known to be important for world modeling in humans, from social interactions (help, deceive) to spatial relations (left, right). Objects, agents, and locations in the items can be flexibly filled in, enabling easy generation of multiple controlled datasets. We then introduce EWoK-core-1.0, a dataset of 4,374 items covering 11 world knowledge domains. We evaluate 20 open-weights large language models (1.3B--70B parameters) and compare them with human performance. All tested models perform worse than humans, with results varying drastically across domains. Performance on social interactions and social properties was highest and performance on physical relations and spatial relations was lowest. Overall, this dataset highlights simple cases where even large models struggle and presents rich avenues for targeted research on LLM world modeling capabilities.</description>

Abstract: Deep Learning has advanced significantly in medical applications, aiding disease diagnosis in Chest X-ray images. However, expanding model capabilities with new data remains a challenge, which Continual Learning (CL) aims to address. Previous studies have evaluated CL strategies based on classification performance; however, in sensitive domains such as healthcare, it is crucial to assess performance across socially salient groups to detect potential biases. This study examines how bias evolves across tasks using domain-specific fairness metrics and how different CL strategies impact this evolution. Our results show that Learning without Forgetting and Pseudo-Label achieve optimal classification performance, but Pseudo-Label is less biased.</description>

      <title>MoralBench: Moral Evaluation of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for a myriad of applications, from natural language processing to decision-making support systems. However, as these models become increasingly integrated into societal frameworks, the imperative to ensure they operate within ethical and moral boundaries has never been more critical. This paper introduces a novel benchmark designed to measure and compare the moral reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We present the first comprehensive dataset specifically curated to probe the moral dimensions of LLM outputs, addressing a wide range of ethical dilemmas and scenarios reflective of real-world complexities.
  The main contribution of this work lies in the development of benchmark datasets and metrics for assessing the moral identity of LLMs, which accounts for nuance, contextual sensitivity, and alignment with human ethical standards. Our methodology involves a multi-faceted approach, combining quantitative analysis with qualitative insights from ethics scholars to ensure a thorough evaluation of model performance. By applying our benchmark across several leading LLMs, we uncover significant variations in moral reasoning capabilities of different models. These findings highlight the importance of considering moral reasoning in the development and evaluation of LLMs, as well as the need for ongoing research to address the biases and limitations uncovered in our study. We publicly release the benchmark at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1k93YZJserYc2CkqP8d4B3M3sgd3kA8W7 and also open-source the code of the project at https://github.com/agiresearch/MoralBench.</description>

      <title>Scaling Value Iteration Networks to 5000 Layers for Extreme Long-Term Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Value Iteration Network (VIN) is an end-to-end differentiable neural network architecture for planning. It exhibits strong generalization to unseen domains by incorporating a differentiable planning module that operates on a latent Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, VINs struggle to scale to long-term and large-scale planning tasks, such as navigating a 100x100 maze -- a task that typically requires thousands of planning steps to solve. We observe that this deficiency is due to two issues: the representation capacity of the latent MDP and the planning module's depth. We address these by augmenting the latent MDP with a dynamic transition kernel, dramatically improving its representational capacity, and, to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, introduce an "adaptive highway loss" that constructs skip connections to improve gradient flow. We evaluate our method on 2D/3D maze navigation environments, continuous control, and the real-world Lunar rover navigation task. We find that our new method, named Dynamic Transition VIN (DT-VIN), scales to 5000 layers and solves challenging versions of the above tasks. Altogether, we believe that DT-VIN represents a concrete step forward in performing long-term large-scale planning in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Deep Transformer Network for Monocular Pose Estimation of Shipborne Unmanned Aerial Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a deep transformer network for estimating the relative 6D pose of a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with respect to a ship using monocular images. A synthetic dataset of ship images is created and annotated with 2D keypoints of multiple ship parts. A Transformer Neural Network model is trained to detect these keypoints and estimate the 6D pose of each part. The estimates are integrated using Bayesian fusion. The model is tested on synthetic data and in-situ flight experiments, demonstrating robustness and accuracy in various lighting conditions. The position estimation error is approximately 0.8\% and 1.0\% of the distance to the ship for the synthetic data and the flight experiments, respectively. The method has potential applications for ship-based autonomous UAV landing and navigation.</description>

      <title>From Intentions to Techniques: A Comprehensive Taxonomy and Challenges in Text Watermarking for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs), safeguarding textual content against unauthorized use is crucial. Watermarking offers a vital solution, protecting both - LLM-generated and plain text sources. This paper presents a unified overview of different perspectives behind designing watermarking techniques through a comprehensive survey of the research literature. Our work has two key advantages: (1) We analyze research based on the specific intentions behind different watermarking techniques, evaluation datasets used, and watermarking addition and removal methods to construct a cohesive taxonomy. (2) We highlight the gaps and open challenges in text watermarking to promote research protecting text authorship. This extensive coverage and detailed analysis sets our work apart, outlining the evolving landscape of text watermarking in Language Models.</description>

      <title>Backdooring Bias ($B^2$) into Stable Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15213v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large text-conditional diffusion models have revolutionized image generation by enabling users to create realistic, high-quality images from textual prompts, significantly enhancing artistic creation and visual communication. However, these advancements also introduce an underexplored attack opportunity: the possibility of inducing biases by an adversary into the generated images for malicious intentions, e.g., to influence public opinion and spread propaganda. In this paper, we study an attack vector that allows an adversary to inject arbitrary bias into a target model. The attack leverages low-cost backdooring techniques using a targeted set of natural textual triggers embedded within a small number of malicious data samples produced with public generative models. An adversary could pick common sequences of words that can then be inadvertently activated by benign users during inference. We investigate the feasibility and challenges of such attacks, demonstrating how modern generative models have made this adversarial process both easier and more adaptable. On the other hand, we explore various aspects of the detectability of such attacks and demonstrate that the model's utility remains intact in the absence of the triggers. Our extensive experiments using over 200,000 generated images and against hundreds of fine-tuned models demonstrate the feasibility of the presented backdoor attack. We illustrate how these biases maintain strong text-image alignment, highlighting the challenges in detecting biased images without knowing that bias in advance. Our cost analysis confirms the low financial barrier (\$10-\$15) to executing such attacks, underscoring the need for robust defensive strategies against such vulnerabilities in diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Is It Really Long Context if All You Need Is Retrieval? Towards Genuinely Difficult Long Context NLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00402v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improvements in language models' capabilities have pushed their applications towards longer contexts, making long-context evaluation and development an active research area. However, many disparate use-cases are grouped together under the umbrella term of "long-context", defined simply by the total length of the model's input, including - for example - Needle-in-a-Haystack tasks, book summarization, and information aggregation. Given their varied difficulty, in this position paper we argue that conflating different tasks by their context length is unproductive. As a community, we require a more precise vocabulary to understand what makes long-context tasks similar or different. We propose to unpack the taxonomy of long-context based on the properties that make them more difficult with longer contexts. We propose two orthogonal axes of difficulty: (I) Diffusion: How hard is it to find the necessary information in the context? (II) Scope: How much necessary information is there to find? We survey the literature on long-context, provide justification for this taxonomy as an informative descriptor, and situate the literature with respect to it. We conclude that the most difficult and interesting settings, whose necessary information is very long and highly diffused within the input, is severely under-explored. By using a descriptive vocabulary and discussing the relevant properties of difficulty in long-context, we can implement more informed research in this area. We call for a careful design of tasks and benchmarks with distinctly long context, taking into account the characteristics that make it qualitatively different from shorter context.</description>

      <title>In the Shadow of Smith`s Invisible Hand: Risks to Economic Stability and Social Wellbeing in the Age of Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Work is fundamental to societal prosperity and mental health, providing financial security, identity, purpose, and social integration. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has catalysed debate on job displacement. Some argue that many new jobs and industries will emerge to offset the displacement, while others foresee a widespread decoupling of economic productivity from human input threatening jobs on an unprecedented scale. This study explores the conditions under which both may be true and examines the potential for a self-reinforcing cycle of recessionary pressures that would necessitate sustained government intervention to maintain job security and economic stability. A system dynamics model was developed to undertake ex ante analysis of the effect of AI-capital deepening on labour underutilisation and demand in the economy. Results indicate that even a moderate increase in the AI-capital-to-labour ratio could increase labour underutilisation to double its current level, decrease per capita disposable income by 26% (95% interval, 20.6% - 31.8%), and decrease the consumption index by 21% (95% interval, 13.6% - 28.3%) by mid-2050. To prevent a reduction in per capita disposable income due to the estimated increase in underutilization, at least a 10.8-fold increase in the new job creation rate would be necessary. Results demonstrate the feasibility of an AI-capital- to-labour ratio threshold beyond which even high rates of new job creation cannot prevent declines in consumption. The precise threshold will vary across economies, emphasizing the urgent need for empirical research tailored to specific contexts. This study underscores the need for governments, civic organisations, and business to work together to ensure a smooth transition to an AI- dominated economy to safeguard the Mental Wealth of nations.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Mobility Management for High-Speed Railway Communications: Compressed Measurements and Proactive Handover</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-speed railway (HSR) communications are pivotal for ensuring rail safety, operations, maintenance, and delivering passenger information services. The high speed of trains creates rapidly time-varying wireless channels, increases the signaling overhead, and reduces the system throughput, making it difficult to meet the growing and stringent needs of HSR applications. In this article, we explore artificial intelligence (AI)-based beam-level and cell-level mobility management suitable for HSR communications. Particularly, we propose a compressed spatial multi-beam measurements scheme via compressive sensing for beam-level mobility management in HSR communications. In comparison to traditional down-sampling spatial beam measurements, this method leads to improved spatial-temporal beam prediction accuracy with the same measurement overhead. Moreover, we propose a novel AI-based proactive handover scheme to predict handover events and reduce radio link failure (RLF) rates in HSR communications. Compared with the traditional event A3-based handover mechanism, the proposed approach significantly reduces the RLF rates which saves 50% beam measurement overhead.</description>

      <title>ReCAP: Recursive Cross Attention Network for Pseudo-Label Generation in Robotic Surgical Skill Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05180v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In surgical skill assessment, the Objective Structured Assessments of Technical Skills (OSATS) and Global Rating Scale (GRS) are well-established tools for evaluating surgeons during training. These metrics, along with performance feedback, help surgeons improve and reach practice standards. Recent research on the open-source JIGSAWS dataset, which includes both GRS and OSATS labels, has focused on regressing GRS scores from kinematic data, video, or their combination. However, we argue that regressing GRS alone is limiting, as it aggregates OSATS scores and overlooks clinically meaningful variations during a surgical trial. To address this, we developed a weakly-supervised recurrent transformer model that tracks a surgeon's performance throughout a session by mapping hidden states to six OSATS, derived from kinematic data. These OSATS scores are averaged to predict GRS, allowing us to compare our model's performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We report Spearman's Correlation Coefficients (SCC) demonstrating that our model outperforms SOTA using kinematic data (SCC 0.83-0.88), and matches performance with video-based models. Our model also surpasses SOTA in most tasks for average OSATS predictions (SCC 0.46-0.70) and specific OSATS (SCC 0.56-0.95). The generation of pseudo-labels at the segment level translates quantitative predictions into qualitative feedback, vital for automated surgical skill assessment pipelines. A senior surgeon validated our model's outputs, agreeing with 77\% of the weakly-supervised predictions \(p=0.006\).</description>

      <title>Towards Clean-Label Backdoor Attacks in the Physical World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are shown to be vulnerable to backdoor poisoning attacks, with most research focusing on \textbf{digital triggers} -- special patterns added to test-time inputs to induce targeted misclassification. \textbf{Physical triggers}, natural objects within a physical scene, have emerged as a desirable alternative since they enable real-time backdoor activations without digital manipulation. However, current physical backdoor attacks require poisoned inputs to have incorrect labels, making them easily detectable by human inspection. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm of attacks, \textbf{clean-label physical backdoor attacks (CLPBA)}, via experiments on facial recognition and animal classification tasks. Our study reveals that CLPBA could be a serious threat with the right poisoning algorithm and physical trigger. A key finding is that different from digital backdoor attacks which exploit memorization to plant backdoors in deep nets, CLPBA works by embedding the feature of the trigger distribution (i.e., the distribution of trigger samples) to the poisoned images through the perturbations. We also find that representative defenses cannot defend against CLPBA easily since CLPBA fundamentally breaks the core assumptions behind these defenses. Our study highlights accidental backdoor activations as a limitation of CLPBA, happening when unintended objects or classes cause the model to misclassify as the target class. The code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/21thinh/Clean-Label-Physical-Backdoor-Attacks.</description>

      <title>Balancing Act: Prioritization Strategies for LLM-Designed Restless Bandit Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12112v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used to design reward functions based on human preferences in Reinforcement Learning (RL). We focus on LLM-designed rewards for Restless Multi-Armed Bandits, a framework for allocating limited resources among agents. In applications such as public health, this approach empowers grassroots health workers to tailor automated allocation decisions to community needs. In the presence of multiple agents, altering the reward function based on human preferences can impact subpopulations very differently, leading to complex tradeoffs and a multi-objective resource allocation problem. We are the first to present a principled method termed Social Choice Language Model for dealing with these tradeoffs for LLM-designed rewards for multiagent planners in general and restless bandits in particular. The novel part of our model is a transparent and configurable selection component, called an adjudicator, external to the LLM that controls complex tradeoffs via a user-selected social welfare function. Our experiments demonstrate that our model reliably selects more effective, aligned, and balanced reward functions compared to purely LLM-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Multiple DER Aggregators on Wholesale Energy Markets: A Hybrid Mean Field Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into wholesale energy markets can greatly enhance grid flexibility, improve market efficiency, and contribute to a more sustainable energy future. As DERs -- such as solar PV panels and energy storage -- proliferate, effective mechanisms are needed to ensure that small prosumers can participate meaningfully in these markets. We study a wholesale market model featuring multiple DER aggregators, each controlling a portfolio of DER resources and bidding into the market on behalf of the DER asset owners. The key of our approach lies in recognizing the repeated nature of market interactions the ability of participants to learn and adapt over time. Specifically, Aggregators repeatedly interact with each other and with other suppliers in the wholesale market, collectively shaping wholesale electricity prices (aka the locational marginal prices (LMPs)). We model this multi-agent interaction using a mean-field game (MFG), which uses market information -- reflecting the average behavior of market participants -- to enable each aggregator to predict long-term LMP trends and make informed decisions. For each aggregator, because they control the DERs within their portfolio under certain contract structures, we employ a mean-field control (MFC) approach (as opposed to a MFG) to learn an optimal policy that maximizes the total rewards of the DERs under their management. We also propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method to help each agent learn optimal strategies within the MFG framework, enhancing their ability to adapt to market conditions and uncertainties. Numerical simulations show that LMPs quickly reach a steady state in the hybrid mean-field approach. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the combination of energy storage and mean-field learning significantly reduces price volatility compared to scenarios without storage.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Synthetic Audio Conversations Generation using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ConversaSynth, a framework designed to generate synthetic conversation audio using large language models (LLMs) with multiple persona settings. The framework first creates diverse and coherent text-based dialogues across various topics, which are then converted into audio using text-to-speech (TTS) systems. Our experiments demonstrate that ConversaSynth effectively generates highquality synthetic audio datasets, which can significantly enhance the training and evaluation of models for audio tagging, audio classification, and multi-speaker speech recognition. The results indicate that the synthetic datasets generated by ConversaSynth exhibit substantial diversity and realism, making them suitable for developing robust, adaptable audio-based AI systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Fair RAG: On the Impact of Fair Ranking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11598v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the central role of retrieval in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, much of the existing research on RAG overlooks the well-established field of fair ranking and fails to account for the interests of all stakeholders involved. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic evaluation of RAG systems that integrate fairness-aware rankings, addressing both ranking fairness and attribution fairness, which ensures equitable exposure of the sources cited in the generated content. Our evaluation focuses on measuring item-side fairness, specifically the fair exposure of relevant items retrieved by RAG systems, and investigates how this fairness impacts both the effectiveness of the systems and the attribution of sources in the generated output that users ultimately see. By experimenting with twelve RAG models across seven distinct tasks, we show that incorporating fairness-aware retrieval often maintains or even enhances both ranking quality and generation quality, countering the common belief that fairness compromises system performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that fair retrieval practices lead to more balanced attribution in the final responses, ensuring that the generator fairly cites the sources it relies on. Our findings underscore the importance of item-side fairness in retrieval and generation, laying the foundation for responsible and equitable RAG systems and guiding future research in fair ranking and attribution.</description>

      <title>Time Distributed Deep Learning Models for Purely Exogenous Forecasting: Application to Water Table Depth Prediction using Weather Image Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Groundwater resources are one of the most relevant elements in the water cycle, therefore developing models to accurately predict them is a pivotal task in the sustainable resource management framework. Deep Learning (DL) models have been revealed to be very effective in hydrology, especially by feeding spatially distributed data (e.g. raster data). In many regions, hydrological measurements are difficult to obtain regularly or periodically in time, and in some cases, the last available data are not up to date. Reversely, weather data, which significantly impacts water resources, are usually more available and with higher quality. More specifically, we have proposed two different DL models to predict the water table depth in the Grana-Maira catchment (Piemonte, IT) using only exogenous weather image time series. To deal with the image time series, both models are made of a first Time Distributed Convolutional Neural Network (TDC) which encodes the image available at each time step into a vectorial representation. The first model, TDC-LSTM uses then a Sequential Module based on an LSTM layer to learn temporal relations and output the predictions. The second model, TDC-UnPWaveNet uses instead a new version of the WaveNet architecture, adapted here to output a sequence shorter and completely shifted in the future with respect to the input one. To this aim, and to deal with the different sequence lengths in the UnPWaveNet, we have designed a new Channel Distributed layer, that acts like a Time Distributed one but on the channel dimension, i.e. applying the same set of operations to each channel of the input. TDC-LSTM and TDC-UnPWaveNet have shown both remarkable results. However, the two models have focused on different learnable information: TDC-LSTM has focused more on lowering the bias, while TDC-UnPWaveNet has focused more on the temporal dynamics, maximizing correlation, and KGE.</description>

      <title>FAMOUS: Flexible Accelerator for the Attention Mechanism of Transformer on UltraScale+ FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer neural networks (TNNs) are being applied across a widening range of application domains, including natural language processing (NLP), machine translation, and computer vision (CV). Their popularity is largely attributed to the exceptional performance of their multi-head self-attention blocks when analyzing sequential data and extracting features. To date, there are limited hardware accelerators tailored for this mechanism, which is the first step before designing an accelerator for a complete model. This paper proposes \textit{FAMOUS}, a flexible hardware accelerator for dense multi-head attention (MHA) computation of TNNs on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). It is optimized for high utilization of processing elements and on-chip memories to improve parallelism and reduce latency. An efficient tiling of large matrices has been employed to distribute memory and computing resources across different modules on various FPGA platforms. The design is evaluated on Xilinx Alveo U55C and U200 data center cards containing Ultrascale+ FPGAs. Experimental results are presented that show that it can attain a maximum throughput, number of parallel attention heads, embedding dimension and tile size of 328 (giga operations/second (GOPS)), 8, 768 and 64 respectively on the U55C. Furthermore, it is 3.28$\times$ and 2.6$\times$ faster than the Intel Xeon Gold 5220R CPU and NVIDIA V100 GPU respectively. It is also 1.3$\times$ faster than the fastest state-of-the-art FPGA-based accelerator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In participatory budgeting (PB), voters decide through voting which subset of projects to fund within a given budget. Proportionality in the context of PB is crucial to ensure equal treatment of all groups of voters. However, pure proportional rules can sometimes lead to suboptimal outcomes. We introduce the Method of Equal Shares with Bounded Overspending (BOS Equal Shares), a robust variant of Equal Shares that balances proportionality and efficiency. BOS Equal Shares addresses inefficiencies implied by strict proportionality axioms, yet the rule still provides fairness guarantees, similar to the original Method of Equal Shares. Our extensive empirical analysis on real-world PB instances shows excellent performance of BOS Equal Shares across several metrics. In the course of the analysis, we also present and examine a fractional variant of the Method of Equal Shares which allows for partial funding of projects.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Quantum Neural Network for Split Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field of research with potential applications to distributed collaborative learning, such as Split Learning (SL). SL allows resource-constrained clients to collaboratively train ML models with a server, reduce their computational overhead, and enable data privacy by avoiding raw data sharing. Although QML with SL has been studied, the problem remains open in resource-constrained environments where clients lack quantum computing capabilities. Additionally, data privacy leakage between client and server in SL poses risks of reconstruction attacks on the server side. To address these issues, we propose Hybrid Quantum Split Learning (HQSL), an application of Hybrid QML in SL. HQSL enables classical clients to train models with a hybrid quantum server and curtails reconstruction attacks. Additionally, we introduce a novel qubit-efficient data-loading technique for designing a quantum layer in HQSL, minimizing both the number of qubits and circuit depth. Evaluations on real hardware demonstrate HQSL's practicality under realistic quantum noise. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate HQSL's feasibility and ability to enhance classification performance compared to its classical models. Notably, HQSL achieves mean improvements of over 3% in both accuracy and F1-score for the Fashion-MNIST dataset, and over 1.5% in both metrics for the Speech Commands dataset. We expand these studies to include up to 100 clients, confirming HQSL's scalability. Moreover, we introduce a noise-based defense mechanism to tackle reconstruction attacks on the server side. Overall, HQSL enables classical clients to train collaboratively with a hybrid quantum server, improving model performance and resistance against reconstruction attacks.</description>

      <title>The Nexus of AR/VR, AI, UI/UX, and Robotics Technologies in Enhancing Learning and Social Interaction for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Systematic Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs), augmented reality (AR), and user interface/user experience (UI/UX) design in therapies for children, especially with disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is studied in detail in this review study. 150 publications were collected by a thorough literature search throughout PubMed, ACM, IEEE Xplore, Elsevier, and Google Scholar; 60 of them were chosen based on their methodological rigor and relevance to the focus area. Three of the primary areas are studied and covered in this review: how AR can improve social and learning results, how LLMs can support communication, and how UI/UX design affects how effective these technologies can be. Results show that while LLMs can provide individualized learning and communication support, AR has shown promise in enhancing social skills, motivation, and attention. For children with ASD, accessible and engaging interventions rely heavily on effective UI/UX design, but there is still a significant lack of robotics-based education and therapeutic programs specifically tailored for autistic children. To optimize the benefits of these technologies in ASD therapies and immersive education, the study emphasizes the need for additional research to address difficulties related to customization, accessibility, and integration.</description>

      <title>GenSim: A General Social Simulation Platform with Large Language Model based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), recent years have witnessed many promising studies on leveraging LLM-based agents to simulate human social behavior. While prior work has demonstrated significant potential across various domains, much of it has focused on specific scenarios involving a limited number of agents and has lacked the ability to adapt when errors occur during simulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LLM-agent-based simulation platform called \textit{GenSim}, which: (1) \textbf{Abstracts a set of general functions} to simplify the simulation of customized social scenarios; (2) \textbf{Supports one hundred thousand agents} to better simulate large-scale populations in real-world contexts; (3) \textbf{Incorporates error-correction mechanisms} to ensure more reliable and long-term simulations. To evaluate our platform, we assess both the efficiency of large-scale agent simulations and the effectiveness of the error-correction mechanisms. To our knowledge, GenSim represents an initial step toward a general, large-scale, and correctable social simulation platform based on LLM agents, promising to further advance the field of social science.</description>

      <title>Diversifying Robot Locomotion Behaviors with Extrinsic Behavioral Curiosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) has shown promise in robot locomotion but is often limited to learning a single expert policy, constraining behavior diversity and robustness in unpredictable real-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce Quality Diversity Inverse Reinforcement Learning (QD-IRL), a novel framework that integrates quality-diversity optimization with IRL methods, enabling agents to learn diverse behaviors from limited demonstrations. This work introduces Extrinsic Behavioral Curiosity (EBC), which allows agents to receive additional curiosity rewards from an external critic based on how novel the behaviors are with respect to a large behavioral archive. To validate the effectiveness of EBC in exploring diverse locomotion behaviors, we evaluate our method on multiple robot locomotion tasks. EBC improves the performance of QD-IRL instances with GAIL, VAIL, and DiffAIL across all included environments by up to 185%, 42%, and 150%, even surpassing expert performance by 20% in Humanoid. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EBC is applicable to Gradient-Arborescence-based Quality Diversity Reinforcement Learning (QD-RL) algorithms, where it substantially improves performance and provides a generic technique for diverse robot locomotion.

      <title>Reducing the Cost of Dropout in Flash-Attention by Hiding RNG with GEMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dropout, a network operator, when enabled is likely to dramatically impact the performance of Flash-Attention, which in turn increases the end-to-end training time of Large-Language-Models (LLMs). The main contributor to such performance degradation is the Random Number Generation (RNG) phase. The state-of-the-art optimization is to fuse RNG into the Flash-Attention kernel. However, while RNG and Attention do not compete on compute or memory resources, they are bounded on the same lower-level architecture bottlenecks. Fusion can hardly hide RNG latency within the Attention kernel.
  We propose overlapping RNG with previous GEMM layers in the network to hide RNG latency and improve end-to-end performance. RNG and GEMM have distinct resource requirements and hardware bottlenecks, so they can run together without compromising each other's performance. We propose a fine-grained analytical performance model that analyzes low-level architecture resource utilization to evaluate RNG-GEMM overlapping performance benefits. This model, cross-validated by silicon results, shows 1.26x speedup for overlapping RNG and GEMM layers over a sequential implementation on one Transformer Block (one LLM layer including multi-head attention and feed-forward layers), and 1.22x over state-of-the-art fusion implementation, for Llama3 on GH100 GPUs with FP8 precision. Because the kernel patterns are regular, the findings of the shared bottlenecks, as well as the achievable performance benefits, can be generalized to different model architectures, software implementations and hardware configurations.</description>

      <title>Performance-Driven QUBO for Recommender Systems on Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Counterfactual Analysis Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (CAQUBO) to solve QUBO problems for feature selection in recommender systems. CAQUBO leverages counterfactual analysis to measure the impact of individual features and feature combinations on model performance and employs the measurements to construct the coefficient matrix for a quantum annealer to select the optimal feature combinations for recommender systems, thereby improving their final recommendation performance. By establishing explicit connections between features and the recommendation performance, the proposed approach demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art quantum annealing methods. Extensive experiments indicate that integrating quantum computing with counterfactual analysis holds great promise for addressing these challenges.</description>

      <title>Free-Mask: A Novel Paradigm of Integration Between the Segmentation Diffusion Model and Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01819v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current semantic segmentation models typically require a substantial amount of manually annotated data, a process that is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Alternatively, leveraging advanced text-to-image models such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion has emerged as an efficient strategy, enabling the automatic generation of synthetic data in place of manual annotations. However, previous methods have been limited to generating single-instance images, as the generation of multiple instances with Stable Diffusion has proven unstable. To address this limitation and expand the scope and diversity of synthetic datasets, we propose a framework \textbf{Free-Mask} that combines a Diffusion Model for segmentation with advanced image editing capabilities, allowing for the integration of multiple objects into images via text-to-image models. Our method facilitates the creation of highly realistic datasets that closely emulate open-world environments while generating accurate segmentation masks. It reduces the labor associated with manual annotation and also ensures precise mask generation. Experimental results demonstrate that synthetic data generated by \textbf{Free-Mask} enables segmentation models to outperform those trained on real data, especially in zero-shot settings. Notably, \textbf{Free-Mask} achieves new state-of-the-art results on previously unseen classes in the VOC 2012 benchmark.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistency Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-alignment, whereby models learn to improve themselves without human annotation, is a rapidly growing research area. However, existing techniques often fail to improve complex reasoning tasks due to the difficulty of assigning correct rewards. An orthogonal approach that is known to improve correctness is self-consistency, a method applied at inference time based on multiple sampling in order to find the most consistent answer. In this work, we extend the self-consistency concept to help train models. We thus introduce self-consistency preference optimization (ScPO), which iteratively trains consistent answers to be preferred over inconsistent ones on unsupervised new problems. We show ScPO leads to large improvements over conventional reward model training on reasoning tasks such as GSM8K and MATH, closing the gap with supervised training with gold answers or preferences, and that combining ScPO with standard supervised learning improves results even further. On ZebraLogic, ScPO finetunes Llama-3 8B to be superior to Llama-3 70B, Gemma-2 27B, and Claude-3 Haiku.</description>

      <title>The Super Weight in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works have shown a surprising result: a small fraction of Large Language Model (LLM) parameter outliers are disproportionately important to the quality of the model. LLMs contain billions of parameters, so these small fractions, such as 0.01%, translate to hundreds of thousands of parameters. In this work, we present an even more surprising finding: Pruning as few as a single parameter can destroy an LLM's ability to generate text -- increasing perplexity by 3 orders of magnitude and reducing zero-shot accuracy to guessing. We propose a data-free method for identifying such parameters, termed super weights, using a single forward pass through the model. We additionally find that these super weights induce correspondingly rare and large activation outliers, termed super activations. When preserved with high precision, super activations can improve simple round-to-nearest quantization to become competitive with state-of-the-art methods. For weight quantization, we similarly find that by preserving the super weight and clipping other weight outliers, round-to-nearest quantization can scale to much larger block sizes than previously considered. To facilitate further research into super weights, we provide an index of super weight coordinates for common, openly available LLMs.</description>

      <title>CODE-CL: Conceptor-Based Gradient Projection for Deep Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) - the ability to progressively acquire and integrate new concepts - is essential to intelligent systems to adapt to dynamic environments. However, deep neural networks struggle with catastrophic forgetting (CF) when learning tasks sequentially, as training for new tasks often overwrites previously learned knowledge. To address this, recent approaches constrain updates to orthogonal subspaces using gradient projection, effectively preserving important gradient directions for previous tasks. While effective in reducing forgetting, these approaches inadvertently hinder forward knowledge transfer (FWT), particularly when tasks are highly correlated. In this work, we propose Conceptor-based gradient projection for Deep Continual Learning (CODE-CL), a novel method that leverages conceptor matrix representations, a form of regularized reconstruction, to adaptively handle highly correlated tasks. CODE-CL mitigates CF by projecting gradients onto pseudo-orthogonal subspaces of previous task feature spaces while simultaneously promoting FWT. It achieves this by learning a linear combination of shared basis directions, allowing efficient balance between stability and plasticity and transfer of knowledge between overlapping input feature representations. Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks validate CODE-CL's efficacy, demonstrating superior performance, reduced forgetting, and improved FWT as compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Using Machine Learning to Discover Parsimonious and Physically-Interpretable Representations of Catchment-Scale Rainfall-Runoff Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04845v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite excellent real-world predictive performance of modern machine learning (ML) methods, many scientists hesitate to discard traditional physical-conceptual (PC) approaches due to their relative interpretability, which contributes to credibility during decision-making. In this context, a currently underexplored aspect of ML is how to develop minimally-optimal representations that can facilitate better insight regarding system functioning. Regardless of how this is achieved, parsimonious representations seem to better support the advancement of scientific understanding. Our own view is that ML-based modeling should be based in use of computational units that are fundamentally easy to interpret in a physical-conceptual sense.
  This paper continues our exploration of how ML can be exploited in the service of scientific investigation. We use the Mass-Conserving-Perceptron (MCP) as the fundamental computational unit in a generic network architecture to explore important issues related to the use of observational data for constructing models of dynamical systems. We show, in the context of lumped catchment modeling, that physical interpretability and predictive performance can both be achieved using a relatively parsimonious distributed-state multiple-flow-path network with context-dependent gating and information sharing across the nodes, suggesting that MCP-based modeling can play a significant role in application of ML to geoscientific investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advanced processing and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven substantial progress in vision-language (VL) understanding tasks. However, while effective for tasks governed by straightforward logic, MLLMs often struggle with reasoning complex, detail-intensive logical structures. To address this limitation, we introduce AgentPS, a novel framework that integrates Agentic Process Supervision into MLLMs by sequentially reasoning over ancillary questions during fine-tuning. AgentPS achieves substantial improvements over baseline MLLMs on both public benchmarks and proprietary datasets. Notably, we show that using MLLM-generated ancillary labels in place of human annotations yields only minimal performance degradation, highlighting the method's scalability. These results establish AgentPS as a scalable and effective solution for complex multimodal classification in large-scale industrial applications.</description>

      <title>On Fusing ChatGPT and Ensemble Learning in Discon-tinuous Named Entity Recognition in Health Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Named Entity Recognition has traditionally been a key task in natural language processing, aiming to identify and extract important terms from unstructured text data. However, a notable challenge for contemporary deep-learning NER models has been identifying discontinuous entities, which are often fragmented within the text. To date, methods to address Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition have not been explored using ensemble learning to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, the rise of large language models, such as ChatGPT in recent years, has shown significant effectiveness across many NLP tasks. Most existing approaches, however, have primarily utilized ChatGPT as a problem-solving tool rather than exploring its potential as an integrative element within ensemble learning algorithms. In this study, we investigated the integration of ChatGPT as an arbitrator within an ensemble method, aiming to enhance performance on DNER tasks. Our method combines five state-of-the-art NER models with ChatGPT using custom prompt engineering to assess the robustness and generalization capabilities of the ensemble algorithm. We conducted experiments on three benchmark medical datasets, comparing our method against the five SOTA models, individual applications of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and a voting ensemble method. The results indicate that our proposed fusion of ChatGPT with the ensemble learning algorithm outperforms the SOTA results in the CADEC, ShARe13, and ShARe14 datasets, showcasing its potential to enhance NLP applications in the healthcare domain.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Long Video Generation Consistency without Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the considerable progress achieved in the long video generation problem, there is still significant room to improve the consistency of the generated videos, particularly in terms of their smoothness and transitions between scenes. We address these issues to enhance the consistency and coherence of videos generated with either single or multiple prompts. We propose the Time-frequency based temporal Attention Reweighting Algorithm (TiARA), which judiciously edits the attention score matrix based on the Discrete Short-Time Fourier Transform. This method is supported by a frequency-based analysis, ensuring that the edited attention score matrix achieves improved consistency across frames. It represents the first-of-its-kind for frequency-based methods in video diffusion models. For videos generated by multiple prompts, we further uncover key factors such as the alignment of the prompts affecting prompt interpolation quality. Inspired by our analyses, we propose PromptBlend, an advanced prompt interpolation pipeline that systematically aligns the prompts. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating consistent and substantial improvements over multiple baselines.</description>

      <title>Mask Approximation Net: A Novel Diffusion Model Approach for Remote Sensing Change Captioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing image change description represents an innovative multimodal task within the realm of remote sensing processing.This task not only facilitates the detection of alterations in surface conditions, but also provides comprehensive descriptions of these changes, thereby improving human interpretability and interactivity.Current deep learning methods typically adopt a three stage framework consisting of feature extraction, feature fusion, and change localization, followed by text generation. Most approaches focus heavily on designing complex network modules but lack solid theoretical guidance, relying instead on extensive empirical experimentation and iterative tuning of network components. This experience-driven design paradigm may lead to overfitting and design bottlenecks, thereby limiting the model's generalizability and adaptability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a paradigm that shift towards data distribution learning using diffusion models, reinforced by frequency-domain noise filtering, to provide a theoretically motivated and practically effective solution to multimodal remote sensing change description.The proposed method primarily includes a simple multi-scale change detection module, whose output features are subsequently refined by a well-designed diffusion model.Furthermore, we introduce a frequency-guided complex filter module to boost the model performance by managing high-frequency noise throughout the diffusion process. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed method across several datasets for remote sensing change detection and description, showcasing its superior performance compared to existing techniques.

      <title>On the Expressiveness and Length Generalization of Selective State-Space Models on Regular Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Selective state-space models (SSMs) are an emerging alternative to the Transformer, offering the unique advantage of parallel training and sequential inference. Although these models have shown promising performance on a variety of tasks, their formal expressiveness and length generalization properties remain underexplored. In this work, we provide insight into the workings of selective SSMs by analyzing their expressiveness and length generalization performance on regular language tasks, i.e., finite-state automaton (FSA) emulation. We address certain limitations of modern SSM-based architectures by introducing the Selective Dense State-Space Model (SD-SSM), the first selective SSM that exhibits perfect length generalization on a set of various regular language tasks using a single layer. It utilizes a dictionary of dense transition matrices, a softmax selection mechanism that creates a convex combination of dictionary matrices at each time step, and a readout consisting of layer normalization followed by a linear map. We then proceed to evaluate variants of diagonal selective SSMs by considering their empirical performance on commutative and non-commutative automata. We explain the experimental results with theoretical considerations. Our code is available at https://github.com/IBM/selective-dense-state-space-model.</description>

      <title>Random weights of DNNs and emergence of fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a special class of deep neural networks (DNNs) where the input and the output vectors have the same dimension. Such DNNs are widely used in applications, e.g., autoencoders. The training of such networks can be characterized by their fixed points (FPs). We are concerned with the dependence of the FPs number and their stability on the distribution of randomly initialized DNNs' weight matrices. Specifically, we consider the i.i.d. random weights with heavy and light-tail distributions. Our objectives are twofold. First, the dependence of FPs number and stability of FPs on the type of the distribution tail. Second, the dependence of the number of FPs on the DNNs' architecture. We perform extensive simulations and show that for light tails (e.g., Gaussian), which are typically used for initialization, a single stable FP exists for broad types of architectures. In contrast, for heavy tail distributions (e.g., Cauchy), which typically appear in trained DNNs, a number of FPs emerge. We further observe that these FPs are stable attractors and their basins of attraction partition the domain of input vectors. Finally, we observe an intriguing non-monotone dependence of the number of fixed points $Q(L)$ on the DNNs' depth $L$. The above results were first obtained for untrained DNNs with two types of distributions at initialization and then verified by considering DNNs in which the heavy tail distributions arise in training.</description>

      <title>Static Segmentation by Tracking: A Label-Efficient Approach for Fine-Grained Specimen Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study image segmentation in the biological domain, particularly trait segmentation from specimen images (e.g., butterfly wing stripes, beetle elytra). This fine-grained task is crucial for understanding the biology of organisms, but it traditionally requires manually annotating segmentation masks for hundreds of images per species, making it highly labor-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a label-efficient approach, Static Segmentation by Tracking (SST), based on a key insight: while specimens of the same species exhibit natural variation, the traits of interest show up consistently. This motivates us to concatenate specimen images into a ``pseudo-video'' and reframe trait segmentation as a tracking problem. Specifically, SST generates masks for unlabeled images by propagating annotated or predicted masks from the ``pseudo-preceding'' images. Built upon recent video segmentation models, such as Segment Anything Model 2, SST achieves high-quality trait segmentation with only one labeled image per species, marking a breakthrough in specimen image analysis. To further enhance segmentation quality, we introduce a cycle-consistent loss for fine-tuning, again requiring only one labeled image. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader potential of SST, including one-shot instance segmentation in natural images and trait-based image retrieval.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing self driving laboratories (SDLs) for materials research, promising unprecedented acceleration of scientific discovery. However, current SDL implementations rely on rigid protocols that fail to capture the adaptability and intuition of expert scientists in dynamic experimental settings. We introduce Artificially Intelligent Lab Assistant (AILA), a framework automating atomic force microscopy through LLM driven agents. Further, we develop AFMBench a comprehensive evaluation suite challenging AI agents across the complete scientific workflow from experimental design to results analysis. We find that state of the art models struggle with basic tasks and coordination scenarios. Notably, Claude 3.5 sonnet performs unexpectedly poorly despite excelling in materials domain question answering (QA) benchmarks, revealing that domain specific QA proficiency does not necessarily translate to effective agentic capabilities. Additionally, we observe that LLMs can deviate from instructions, raising safety alignment concerns for SDL applications. Our ablations reveal that multi agent frameworks outperform single-agent architectures. We also observe significant prompt fragility, where slight modifications in prompt structure cause substantial performance variations in capable models like GPT 4o. Finally, we evaluate AILA's effectiveness in increasingly advanced experiments AFM calibration, feature detection, mechanical property measurement, graphene layer counting, and indenter detection. Our findings underscore the necessity for rigorous benchmarking protocols and prompt engineering strategies before deploying AI laboratory assistants in scientific research environments.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Table Instruction Tuning</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in table understanding have focused on instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) for table-related tasks. However, existing research has overlooked the impact of hyperparameter choices, and also lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the out-of-domain table understanding ability and the general capabilities of these table LLMs. In this paper, we evaluate these abilities in existing table LLMs, and find significant declines in both out-of-domain table understanding and general capabilities as compared to their base models. Through systematic analysis, we show that hyperparameters, such as learning rate, can significantly influence both table-specific and general capabilities. Contrary to the previous table instruction-tuning work, we demonstrate that smaller learning rates and fewer training instances can enhance table understanding while preserving general capabilities. Based on our findings, we introduce TAMA, a TAble LLM instruction-tuned from LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, which achieves performance on par with, or surpassing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on table tasks, while maintaining strong out-of-domain generalization and general capabilities. Our findings highlight the potential for reduced data annotation costs and more efficient model development through careful hyperparameter selection. We open-source the project and our models.</description>

      <title>In-Context Meta LoRA Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities for task specific fine-tuning. However, in scenarios that involve multiple tasks, training a separate LoRA model for each one results in considerable inefficiency in terms of storage and inference. Moreover, existing parameter generation methods fail to capture the correlations among these tasks, making multi-task LoRA parameter generation challenging. To address these limitations, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA (ICM-LoRA), a novel approach that efficiently achieves task-specific customization of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we use training data from all tasks to train a tailored generator, Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE). CVAE takes task descriptions as inputs and produces task-aware LoRA weights as outputs. These LoRA weights are then merged with LLMs to create task-specialized models without the need for additional fine-tuning. Furthermore, we utilize in-context meta-learning for knowledge enhancement and task mapping, to capture the relationship between tasks and parameter distributions. As a result, our method achieves more accurate LoRA parameter generation for diverse tasks using CVAE. ICM-LoRA enables more accurate LoRA parameter reconstruction than current parameter reconstruction methods and is useful for implementing task-specific enhancements of LoRA parameters. At the same time, our method occupies 283MB, only 1\% storage compared with the original LoRA.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for Mental Health Emergency Returns: Integrating LLMs with Predictive Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00025v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Importance: Emergency department (ED) returns for mental health conditions pose a major healthcare burden, with 24-27% of patients returning within 30 days. Traditional machine learning models for predicting these returns often lack interpretability for clinical use.
  Objective: To assess whether integrating large language models (LLMs) with machine learning improves predictive accuracy and clinical interpretability of ED mental health return risk models.
  Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 42,464 ED visits for 27,904 unique mental health patients at an academic medical center in the Deep South from January 2018 to December 2022.
  Main Outcomes and Measures: Two primary outcomes were evaluated: (1) 30-day ED return prediction accuracy and (2) model interpretability using a novel LLM-enhanced framework integrating SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values with clinical knowledge.
  Results: For chief complaint classification, LLaMA 3 (8B) with 10-shot learning outperformed traditional models (accuracy: 0.882, F1-score: 0.86). In SDoH classification, LLM-based models achieved 0.95 accuracy and 0.96 F1-score, with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Substance Abuse performing best (F1: 0.96-0.89), while Exercise and Home Environment showed lower performance (F1: 0.70-0.67). The LLM-based interpretability framework achieved 99% accuracy in translating model predictions into clinically relevant explanations. LLM-extracted features improved XGBoost AUC from 0.74 to 0.76 and AUC-PR from 0.58 to 0.61.
  Conclusions and Relevance: Integrating LLMs with machine learning models yielded modest but consistent accuracy gains while significantly enhancing interpretability through automated, clinically relevant explanations. This approach provides a framework for translating predictive analytics into actionable clinical insights.</description>

      <title>Learning Traffic Anomalies from Generative Models on Real-Time Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01391v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate detection of traffic anomalies is crucial for effective urban traffic management and congestion mitigation. We use the Spatiotemporal Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) framework combining Graph Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data. We apply STGAN to real-time, minute-by-minute observations from 42 traffic cameras across Gothenburg, Sweden, collected over several months in 2020. The images are processed to compute a flow metric representing vehicle density, which serves as input for the model. Training is conducted on data from April to November 2020, and validation is performed on a separate dataset from November 14 to 23, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the model effectively detects traffic anomalies with high precision and low false positive rates. The detected anomalies include camera signal interruptions, visual artifacts, and extreme weather conditions affecting traffic flow.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Local Search Approach for Polarized Community Discovery in Signed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signed networks, where edges are labeled as positive or negative to represent friendly or antagonistic interactions, offer a natural framework for analyzing polarization, trust, and conflict in social systems. Detecting meaningful group structures in such networks is crucial for understanding online discourse, political divisions, and trust dynamics. A key challenge is to identify communities that are internally cohesive and externally antagonistic, while allowing for neutral or unaligned vertices. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying $k$ polarized communities that addresses a major limitation of prior methods: their tendency to produce highly size-imbalanced solutions. We introduce a novel optimization objective that avoids such imbalance. In addition, it is well known that approximation algorithms based on local search are highly effective for clustering signed networks when neutral vertices are not allowed. We build on this idea and design the first local search algorithm that extends to the setting with neutral vertices while scaling to large networks. By connecting our approach to block-coordinate Frank-Wolfe optimization, we prove a linear convergence rate, enabled by the structure of our objective. Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality, while remaining competitive in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Code Simulation as a Proxy for High-order Tasks in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03568v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many reasoning, planning, and problem-solving tasks share an intrinsic algorithmic nature: correctly simulating each step is a sufficient condition to solve them correctly. We collect pairs of naturalistic and synthetic reasoning tasks to assess the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM). While naturalistic tasks often require careful human handcrafting, we show that synthetic data is, in many cases, a good proxy that is much easier to collect at scale. We leverage common constructs in programming as the counterpart of the building blocks of naturalistic reasoning tasks, such as straight-line programs, code that contains critical paths, and approximate and redundant instructions. We further assess the capabilities of LLMs on sorting problems and repeated operations via sorting algorithms and nested loops. Our synthetic datasets further reveal that while the most powerful LLMs exhibit relatively strong execution capabilities, the process is fragile: it is negatively affected by memorisation and seems to rely heavily on pattern recognition. Our contribution builds upon synthetically testing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs as a scalable complement to handcrafted human-annotated problems.</description>

      <title>UniForm: A Unified Multi-Task Diffusion Transformer for Audio-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03897v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of diffusion models, audio-video generation has been revolutionized. However, most existing methods rely on separate modules for each modality, with limited exploration of unified generative architectures. In addition, many are confined to a single task and small-scale datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce UniForm, a unified multi-task diffusion transformer that generates both audio and visual modalities in a shared latent space. By using a unified denoising network, UniForm captures the inherent correlations between sound and vision. Additionally, we propose task-specific noise schemes and task tokens, enabling the model to support multiple tasks with a single set of parameters, including video-to-audio, audio-to-video and text-to-audio-video generation. Furthermore, by leveraging large language models and a large-scale text-audio-video combined dataset, UniForm achieves greater generative diversity than prior approaches. Experiments show that UniForm achieves performance close to the state-of-the-art single-task models across three generation tasks, with generated content that is not only highly aligned with real-world data distributions but also enables more diverse and fine-grained generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) has emerged as a robust solution for collaborative model training in dynamic environments, where data samples are continuously generated and distributed across multiple devices. This survey provides a comprehensive review of FCL, focusing on key challenges such as heterogeneity, model stability, communication overhead, and privacy preservation. We explore various forms of heterogeneity and their impact on model performance. Solutions to non-IID data, resource-constrained platforms, and personalized learning are reviewed in an effort to show the complexities of handling heterogeneous data distributions. Next, we review techniques for ensuring model stability and avoiding catastrophic forgetting, which are critical in non-stationary environments. Privacy-preserving techniques are another aspect of FCL that have been reviewed in this work. This survey has integrated insights from federated learning and continual learning to present strategies for improving the efficacy and scalability of FCL systems, making it applicable to a wide range of real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>FairFare: A Tool for Crowdsourcing Rideshare Data to Empower Labor Organizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rideshare workers experience unpredictable working conditions due to gig work platforms' reliance on opaque AI and algorithmic systems. In response to these challenges, we found that labor organizers want data to help them advocate for legislation to increase the transparency and accountability of these platforms. To address this need, we collaborated with a Colorado-based rideshare union to develop FairFare, a tool that crowdsources and analyzes workers' data to estimate the take rate -- the percentage of the rider price retained by the rideshare platform. We deployed FairFare with our partner organization that collaborated with us in collecting data on 76,000+ trips from 45 drivers over 18 months. During evaluation interviews, organizers reported that FairFare helped influence the bill language and passage of Colorado Senate Bill 24-75, calling for greater transparency and data disclosure of platform operations, and create a national narrative. Finally, we reflect on complexities of translating quantitative data into policy outcomes, nature of community based audits, and design implications for future transparency tools.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs Understand the Safety of Their Inputs? Training-Free Moderation via Latent Prototypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of LLMs, ensuring model safety and alignment has become a critical concern. While modern instruction-finetuned LLMs incorporate alignment during training, they still frequently require moderation tools to prevent unsafe behavior. The most common approach to moderation are guard models that flag unsafe inputs. However, guards require costly training and are typically limited to fixed-size, pre-trained options, making them difficult to adapt to evolving risks and resource constraints. We hypothesize that instruction-finetuned LLMs already encode safety-relevant information internally and explore training-free safety assessment methods that work with off-the-shelf models. We show that simple prompting allows models to recognize harmful inputs they would otherwise mishandle. We also demonstrate that safe and unsafe prompts are distinctly separable in the models' latent space. Building on this, we introduce the Latent Prototype Moderator (LPM), a training-free moderation method that uses Mahalanobis distance in latent space to assess input safety. LPM is a lightweight, customizable add-on that generalizes across model families and sizes. Our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art guard models across multiple safety benchmarks, offering a practical and flexible solution for scalable LLM moderation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for graded neural networks (GNNs) built over graded vector spaces $\V_\w^n$, extending classical neural architectures by incorporating algebraic grading. Leveraging a coordinate-wise grading structure with scalar action $\lambda \star \x = (\lambda^{q_i} x_i)$, defined by a tuple $\w = (q_0, \ldots, q_{n-1})$, we introduce graded neurons, layers, activation functions, and loss functions that adapt to feature significance. Theoretical properties of graded spaces are established, followed by a comprehensive GNN design, addressing computational challenges like numerical stability and gradient scaling. Potential applications span machine learning and photonic systems, exemplified by high-speed laser-based implementations. This work offers a foundational step toward graded computation, unifying mathematical rigor with practical potential, with avenues for future empirical and hardware exploration.</description>

      <title>Integrating Biological and Machine Intelligence: Attention Mechanisms in Brain-Computer Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, attention mechanisms have become indispensable in electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis, significantly enhancing Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. This paper presents a comprehensive review of traditional and Transformer-based attention mechanisms, their embedding strategies, and their applications in EEG-based BCI, with a particular emphasis on multimodal data fusion. By capturing EEG variations across time, frequency, and spatial channels, attention mechanisms improve feature extraction, representation learning, and model robustness. These methods can be broadly categorized into traditional attention mechanisms, which typically integrate with convolutional and recurrent networks, and Transformer-based multi-head self-attention, which excels in capturing long-range dependencies. Beyond single-modality analysis, attention mechanisms also enhance multimodal EEG applications, facilitating effective fusion between EEG and other physiological or sensory data. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and emerging trends in attention-based EEG modeling, highlighting future directions for advancing BCI technology. This review aims to provide valuable insights for researchers seeking to leverage attention mechanisms for improved EEG interpretation and application.</description>

Abstract: While internet-scale image and textual data have enabled strong generalization in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the absence of internet-scale control data has impeded the development of similar generalization in standard reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Although VLMs are fundamentally limited in their ability to solve control tasks due to their lack of action-conditioned training data, their capacity for image understanding allows them to provide valuable feedback in RL tasks by recognizing successful outcomes. A key challenge in Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) is determining how best to integrate VLM-derived signals into the learning process. We explore this question in the context of offline RL and introduce a class of methods called Sub-Trajectory Filtered Optimization (SFO). We identify three key insights. First, trajectory length plays a crucial role in offline RL, as full-trajectory preference learning exacerbates the stitching problem, necessitating the use of sub-trajectories. Second, even in Markovian environments, a non-Markovian reward signal from a sequence of images is required to assess trajectory improvement, as VLMs do not interpret control actions and must rely on visual cues over time. Third, a simple yet effective approach--filtered and weighted behavior cloning--consistently outperforms more complex RLHF-based methods. We propose Sub-Trajectory Filtered Behavior Cloning (SFBC), a method that leverages VLM feedback on sub-trajectories while incorporating a retrospective filtering mechanism that removes sub-trajectories preceding failures to improve robustness and prevent turbulence.

      <title>Language Models can Self-Improve at State-Value Estimation for Better Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02878</link>

Abstract: Collecting ground-truth rewards or human demonstrations for multi-step reasoning tasks is often prohibitively expensive and time consuming, especially in interactive domains like web tasks. To address this bottleneck, we present self-taught lookahead (STL), a self-supervised method that leverages state-transition dynamics to improve a value model capable of effectively guiding language model-controlled search without any labeled data. We find that moderately sized (8 billion parameters) open-weight value models improved with STL can match the performance of using a gpt-4o value model. Furthermore, we find that specialized value models learned with STL can be deployed with computationally lightweight search algorithms, achieving performance that matches that of more expensive tree search methods, while reducing costs by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Probing Latent Subspaces in LLM for AI Security: Identifying and Manipulating Adversarial States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations such as jailbreaking via prompt injection attacks. These attacks bypass safety mechanisms to generate restricted or harmful content. In this study, we investigated the underlying latent subspaces of safe and jailbroken states by extracting hidden activations from a LLM. Inspired by attractor dynamics in neuroscience, we hypothesized that LLM activations settle into semi stable states that can be identified and perturbed to induce state transitions. Using dimensionality reduction techniques, we projected activations from safe and jailbroken responses to reveal latent subspaces in lower dimensional spaces. We then derived a perturbation vector that when applied to safe representations, shifted the model towards a jailbreak state. Our results demonstrate that this causal intervention results in statistically significant jailbreak responses in a subset of prompts. Next, we probed how these perturbations propagate through the model's layers, testing whether the induced state change remains localized or cascades throughout the network. Our findings indicate that targeted perturbations induced distinct shifts in activations and model responses. Our approach paves the way for potential proactive defenses, shifting from traditional guardrail based methods to preemptive, model agnostic techniques that neutralize adversarial states at the representation level.</description>

Abstract: Effective long-term memory management is crucial for language models handling extended contexts. We introduce a novel framework that dynamically ranks memory entries based on relevance. Unlike previous works, our model introduces a novel relevance scoring and a pointwise re-ranking model for key-value embeddings, inspired by learning-to-rank techniques in information retrieval.

      <title>MASS: Mathematical Data Selection via Skill Graphs for Pretraining Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-quality data plays a critical role in the pretraining and fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), even determining their performance ceiling to some degree. Consequently, numerous data selection methods have been proposed to identify subsets of data that can effectively and efficiently enhance model performance. However, most of these methods focus on general data selection and tend to overlook the specific nuances of domain-related data. In this paper, we introduce MASS, a \textbf{MA}thematical data \textbf{S}election framework using the \textbf{S}kill graph for pretraining LLMs in the mathematical reasoning domain. By taking into account the unique characteristics of mathematics and reasoning, we construct a skill graph that captures the mathematical skills and their interrelations from a reference dataset. This skill graph guides us in assigning quality scores to the target dataset, enabling us to select the top-ranked subset which is further used to pretrain LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of MASS across different model sizes (1B and 7B) and pretraining datasets (web data and synthetic data). Specifically, in terms of efficiency, models trained on subsets selected by MASS can achieve similar performance to models trained on the original datasets, with a significant reduction in the number of trained tokens - ranging from 50\% to 70\% fewer tokens. In terms of effectiveness, when trained on the same amount of tokens, models trained on the data selected by MASS outperform those trained on the original datasets by 3.3\% to 5.9\%. These results underscore the potential of MASS to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of pretraining LLMs.</description>

      <title>Neural Discrete Token Representation Learning for Extreme Token Reduction in Video Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16980v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Token-based video representation has emerged as a promising approach for enabling large language models (LLMs) to interpret video content. However, existing token reduction techniques, such as pruning and merging, often disrupt essential positional embeddings and rely on continuous visual tokens sampled from nearby pixels with similar spatial-temporal locations. By removing only a small fraction of tokens, these methods still produce relatively lengthy continuous sequences, which falls short of the extreme compression required to balance computational efficiency and token count in video LLMs. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of Extreme Short Token Reduction, which aims to represent entire videos using a minimal set of discrete tokens. We propose VQToken, a neural discrete token representation framework that (i) applies adaptive vector quantization to continuous ViT embeddings to learn a compact codebook and (ii) preserves spatial-temporal positions via a token hash function by assigning each grid-level token to its nearest codebook entry. On the Extreme Short Token Reduction task, our VQToken compresses sequences to just 0.07 percent of their original length while incurring only a 0.66 percent drop in accuracy on the NextQA-MC benchmark. It also achieves comparable performance on ActNet-QA, Long Video Bench, and VideoMME. We further introduce the Token Information Density (TokDense) metric and formalize fixed-length and adaptive-length subtasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in both settings. Our approach dramatically lowers theoretical complexity, increases information density, drastically reduces token counts, and enables efficient video LLMs in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>PVChat: Personalized Video Chat with One-Shot Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video large language models (ViLLMs) excel in general video understanding, e.g., recognizing activities like talking and eating, but struggle with identity-aware comprehension, such as "Wilson is receiving chemotherapy" or "Tom is discussing with Sarah", limiting their applicability in smart healthcare and smart home environments. To address this limitation, we propose a one-shot learning framework PVChat, the first personalized ViLLM that enables subject-aware question answering (QA) from a single video for each subject. Our approach optimizes a Mixture-of-Heads (MoH) enhanced ViLLM on a synthetically augmented video-QA dataset, leveraging a progressive image-to-video learning strategy. Specifically, we introduce an automated augmentation pipeline that synthesizes identity-preserving positive samples and retrieves hard negatives from existing video corpora, generating a diverse training dataset with four QA types: existence, appearance, action, and location inquiries. To enhance subject-specific learning, we propose a ReLU Routing MoH attention mechanism, alongside two novel objectives: (1) Smooth Proximity Regularization for progressive learning through exponential distance scaling and (2) Head Activation Enhancement for balanced attention routing. Finally, we adopt a two-stage training strategy, transitioning from image pre-training to video fine-tuning, enabling a gradual learning process from static attributes to dynamic representations. We evaluate PVChat on diverse datasets covering medical scenarios, TV series, anime, and real-world footage, demonstrating its superiority in personalized feature understanding after learning from a single video, compared to state-of-the-art ViLLMs.</description>

      <title>Construction Identification and Disambiguation Using BERT: A Case Study of NPN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Construction Grammar hypothesizes that knowledge of a language consists chiefly of knowledge of form-meaning pairs (''constructions'') that include vocabulary, general grammar rules, and even idiosyncratic patterns. Recent work has shown that transformer language models represent at least some constructional patterns, including ones where the construction is rare overall. In this work, we probe BERT's representation of the form and meaning of a minor construction of English, the NPN (noun-preposition-noun) construction -- exhibited in such expressions as face to face and day to day -- which is known to be polysemous. We construct a benchmark dataset of semantically annotated corpus instances (including distractors that superficially resemble the construction). With this dataset, we train and evaluate probing classifiers. They achieve decent discrimination of the construction from distractors, as well as sense disambiguation among true instances of the construction, revealing that BERT embeddings carry indications of the construction's semantics. Moreover, artificially permuting the word order of true construction instances causes them to be rejected, indicating sensitivity to matters of form. We conclude that BERT does latently encode at least some knowledge of the NPN construction going beyond a surface syntactic pattern and lexical cues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a fundamental technology for numerous human - centered intelligent applications. Although deep learning methods have been utilized to accelerate feature extraction, issues such as multimodal data mixing, activity heterogeneity, and complex model deployment remain largely unresolved. The aim of this paper is to address issues such as multimodal data mixing, activity heterogeneity, and complex model deployment in sensor-based human activity recognition. We propose a spatiotemporal attention modal decomposition alignment fusion strategy to tackle the problem of the mixed distribution of sensor data. Key discriminative features of activities are captured through cross-modal spatio-temporal disentangled representation, and gradient modulation is combined to alleviate data heterogeneity. In addition, a wearable deployment simulation system is constructed. We conducted experiments on a large number of public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces UnityAI-Guard, a framework for binary toxicity classification targeting low-resource Indian languages. While existing systems predominantly cater to high-resource languages, UnityAI-Guard addresses this critical gap by developing state-of-the-art models for identifying toxic content across diverse Brahmic/Indic scripts. Our approach achieves an impressive average F1-score of 84.23% across seven languages, leveraging a dataset of 567k training instances and 30k manually verified test instances. By advancing multilingual content moderation for linguistically diverse regions, UnityAI-Guard also provides public API access to foster broader adoption and application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microfluidic Live-Cell Imaging (MLCI) yields data on microbial cell factories. However, continuous acquisition is challenging as high-throughput experiments often lack real-time insights, delaying responses to stochastic events. We introduce three components in the Experiment Automation Pipeline for Event-Driven Microscopy to Smart Microfluidic Single-Cell Analysis (EAP4EMSIG): a fast, accurate Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)-based autofocusing method predicting the focus offset, an evaluation of real-time segmentation methods and a real-time data analysis dashboard. Our MLP-based autofocusing achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.105 $\mu$m with inference times from 87 ms. Among eleven evaluated Deep Learning (DL) segmentation methods, Cellpose reached a Panoptic Quality (PQ) of 93.36 %, while a distance-based method was fastest (121 ms, Panoptic Quality 93.02 %).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective conversational agents like large language models (LLMs) must personalize their interactions to adapt to user preferences, personalities, and attributes across diverse domains like education and healthcare. Current methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often prioritize helpfulness and safety but fall short in fostering truly empathetic, adaptive, and personalized dialogues. Existing personalization approaches typically rely on extensive user history, limiting their effectiveness for new or context-limited users. To address these limitations, we propose leveraging a user model to incorporate a curiosity-based intrinsic reward into multi-turn RLHF. This novel reward mechanism encourages the LLM agent to actively infer user traits by optimizing conversations to improve its user model's accuracy. Consequently, the agent delivers more personalized interactions by learning more about the user. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness in two distinct domains: significantly improving personalization performance in a conversational recommendation task, and personalizing conversations for different learning styles in an educational setting. We show improved generalization capabilities compared to traditional multi-turn RLHF, all while maintaining conversation quality. Our method offers a promising solution for creating more personalized, adaptive, and engaging conversational agents.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Robustness: A Benchmarking Framework for Deep Learning Forecasting in Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in domains such as manufacturing and energy distribution generate complex time series data crucial for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). While Deep Learning (DL) methods have demonstrated strong forecasting capabilities, their adoption in industrial CPS remains limited due insufficient robustness. Existing robustness evaluations primarily focus on formal verification or adversarial perturbations, inadequately representing the complexities encountered in real-world CPS scenarios. To address this, we introduce a practical robustness definition grounded in distributional robustness, explicitly tailored to industrial CPS, and propose a systematic framework for robustness evaluation. Our framework simulates realistic disturbances, such as sensor drift, noise and irregular sampling, enabling thorough robustness analyses of forecasting models on real-world CPS datasets. The robustness definition provides a standardized score to quantify and compare model performance across diverse datasets, assisting in informed model selection and architecture design. Through extensive empirical studies evaluating prominent DL architectures (including recurrent, convolutional, attention-based, modular, and structured state-space models) we demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our approach. We publicly release our robustness benchmark to encourage further research and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Breach in the Shield: Unveiling the Vulnerabilities of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to carefully crafted perturbations. In this study, we seek to pinpoint the sources of this fragility by identifying parameters and input dimensions (pixels or token embeddings) that are susceptible to such perturbations. To this end, we propose a stability measure called \textbf{FI}, \textbf{F}irst order local \textbf{I}nfluence, which is rooted in information geometry and quantifies the sensitivity of individual parameter and input dimensions. Our extensive analysis across LLMs and VLMs (from 1.5B to 13B parameters) reveals that: (I) A small subset of parameters or input dimensions with high FI values disproportionately contribute to model brittleness. (II) Mitigating the influence of these vulnerable parameters during model merging leads to improved performance.</description>

      <title>NativQA Framework: Enabling LLMs with Native, Local, and Everyday Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about cultural bias, fairness, and their applicability in diverse linguistic and underrepresented regional contexts. To enhance and benchmark the capabilities of LLMs, there is a need to develop large-scale resources focused on multilingual, local, and cultural contexts. In this study, we propose the NativQA framework, which can seamlessly construct large-scale, culturally and regionally aligned QA datasets in native languages. The framework utilizes user-defined seed queries and leverages search engines to collect location-specific, everyday information. It has been evaluated across 39 locations in 24 countries and in 7 languages -- ranging from extremely low-resource to high-resource languages -- resulting in over 300K Question-Answer (QA) pairs. The developed resources can be used for LLM benchmarking and further fine-tuning. The framework has been made publicly available for the community (https://gitlab.com/nativqa/nativqa-framework).</description>

      <title>TerraMind: Large-Scale Generative Multimodality for Earth Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11171v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present TerraMind, the first any-to-any generative, multimodal foundation model for Earth observation (EO). Unlike other multimodal models, TerraMind is pretrained on dual-scale representations combining both token-level and pixel-level data across modalities. On a token level, TerraMind encodes high-level contextual information to learn cross-modal relationships, while on a pixel level, TerraMind leverages fine-grained representations to capture critical spatial nuances. We pretrained TerraMind on nine geospatial modalities of a global, large-scale dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate that (i) TerraMind's dual-scale early fusion approach unlocks a range of zero-shot and few-shot applications for Earth observation, (ii) TerraMind introduces "Thinking-in-Modalities" (TiM) -- the capability of generating additional artificial data during finetuning and inference to improve the model output -- and (iii) TerraMind achieves beyond state-of-the-art performance in community-standard benchmarks for EO like PANGAEA. The pretraining dataset, the model weights, and our code are open-sourced under a permissive license.</description>

      <title>Towards Explainable Fusion and Balanced Learning in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) faces two critical challenges: the lack of interpretability in the decision logic of multimodal fusion and modality imbalance caused by disparities in inter-modal information density. To address these issues, we propose KAN-MCP, a novel framework that integrates the interpretability of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with the robustness of the Multimodal Clean Pareto (MCPareto) framework. First, KAN leverages its univariate function decomposition to achieve transparent analysis of cross-modal interactions. This structural design allows direct inspection of feature transformations without relying on external interpretation tools, thereby ensuring both high expressiveness and interpretability. Second, the proposed MCPareto enhances robustness by addressing modality imbalance and noise interference. Specifically, we introduce the Dimensionality Reduction and Denoising Modal Information Bottleneck (DRD-MIB) method, which jointly denoises and reduces feature dimensionality. This approach provides KAN with discriminative low-dimensional inputs to reduce the modeling complexity of KAN while preserving critical sentiment-related information. Furthermore, MCPareto dynamically balances gradient contributions across modalities using the purified features output by DRD-MIB, ensuring lossless transmission of auxiliary signals and effectively alleviating modality imbalance. This synergy of interpretability and robustness not only achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets such as CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS v2 but also offers an intuitive visualization interface through KAN's interpretable architecture. Our code is released on https://github.com/LuoMSen/KAN-MCP.</description>

      <title>AI for the Open-World: the Learning Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the past decades, numerous successes of AI has been made on "specific capabilities", named closed-world, such as artificial environments or specific real-world tasks. This well-defined narrow capability brings two nice benefits, a clear criterion of success and the opportunity to collect a lot of examples. The criteria not only reveal whether a machine has achieved a goal, but reveal how the machine falls short of the goal. As a result, human designers can fix the problems one after the other until the machine is deemed good enough for the task. Furthermore, the large set of collected examples reduces the difficulty of this problem-fixing process (by the central limit theorem).
  Do the success in closed-world translate into broad open-world, where a machine is required to perform any task that a human could possibly undertake with fewer examples and less priori knowledge from human designers? No. Because competence in a specific task provides little insight in handling other tasks, the valuable criteria for specific tasks become helpless when handling broader unseen tasks. Furthermore, due to the shortage of examples in unseen tasks, central limit theorem does not stand on our side. At the end, human designers lose the oscilloscope to "hack" an AI system for the open-world.
  Achieving AI for the open-world requires unique learning principles and innovated techniques, which are different from the ones in building AI for the closed-world. This thesis explores necessary learning principles required to construct AI for the open-world, including rich features (analogy a large tool box), disentangled representation (an organized tool box), and inference-time learning (a tool-savvy hand). Driven by the learning principles, this thesis further proposes techniques to use the learning principles, conducts enormous large-scale experiments to verify the learning principles.</description>

      <title>EasyEdit2: An Easy-to-use Steering Framework for Editing Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce EasyEdit2, a framework designed to enable plug-and-play adjustability for controlling Large Language Model (LLM) behaviors. EasyEdit2 supports a wide range of test-time interventions, including safety, sentiment, personality, reasoning patterns, factuality, and language features. Unlike its predecessor, EasyEdit2 features a new architecture specifically designed for seamless model steering. It comprises key modules such as the steering vector generator and the steering vector applier, which enable automatic generation and application of steering vectors to influence the model's behavior without modifying its parameters. One of the main advantages of EasyEdit2 is its ease of use-users do not need extensive technical knowledge. With just a single example, they can effectively guide and adjust the model's responses, making precise control both accessible and efficient. Empirically, we report model steering performance across different LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques. We have released the source code on GitHub at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit along with a demonstration notebook. In addition, we provide a demo video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkfoiPfp5rQ for a quick introduction.</description>

      <title>The Role of Open-Source LLMs in Shaping the Future of GeoAI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), offering new capabilities in data processing, spatial analysis, and decision support. This paper examines the open-source paradigm's critical role in this transformation. While proprietary LLMs offer accessibility, they often limit the customization, interoperability, and transparency vital for specialized geospatial tasks. Conversely, open-source alternatives significantly advance Geographic Information Science (GIScience) by fostering greater adaptability, reproducibility, and community-driven innovation. Open frameworks empower researchers to tailor solutions, integrate cutting-edge methodologies (e.g., reinforcement learning, advanced spatial indexing), and align with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. However, the growing reliance on any LLM necessitates careful consideration of security vulnerabilities, ethical risks, and robust governance for AI-generated geospatial outputs. This paper argues that GIScience advances best not through a single model type, but by cultivating a diverse, interoperable ecosystem combining open-source foundations for innovation, custom geospatial models, and interdisciplinary collaboration. By critically evaluating the opportunities and challenges of open-source LLMs within the broader GeoAI landscape, this work contributes to a thorough discourse on leveraging LLMs to effectively advance spatial research, policy, and decision-making in an equitable, sustainable, and scientifically rigorous manner.</description>

      <title>Rewriting Pre-Training Data Boosts LLM Performance in Math and Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) in program synthesis and mathematical reasoning is fundamentally limited by the quality of their pre-training corpora. We introduce two openly licensed datasets, released under the Llama 3.3 Community License, that significantly enhance LLM performance by systematically rewriting public data. SwallowCode (approximately 16.1 billion tokens) refines Python snippets from The-Stack-v2 through a novel four-stage pipeline: syntax validation, pylint-based style filtering, and a two-stage LLM rewriting process that enforces style conformity and transforms snippets into self-contained, algorithmically efficient examples. Unlike prior methods that rely on exclusionary filtering or limited transformations, our transform-and-retain approach upgrades low-quality code, maximizing data utility. SwallowMath (approximately 2.3 billion tokens) enhances Finemath-4+ by removing boilerplate, restoring context, and reformatting solutions into concise, step-by-step explanations. Within a fixed 50 billion token training budget, continual pre-training of Llama-3.1-8B with SwallowCode boosts pass@1 by +17.0 on HumanEval and +17.7 on HumanEval+ compared to Stack-Edu, surpassing the baseline model's code generation capabilities. Similarly, substituting SwallowMath yields +12.4 accuracy on GSM8K and +7.6 on MATH. Ablation studies confirm that each pipeline stage contributes incrementally, with rewriting delivering the largest gains. All datasets, prompts, and checkpoints are publicly available, enabling reproducible research and advancing LLM pre-training for specialized domains.</description>

      <title>Explainable Coarse-to-Fine Ancient Manuscript Duplicates Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ancient manuscripts are the primary source of ancient linguistic corpora. However, many ancient manuscripts exhibit duplications due to unintentional repeated publication or deliberate forgery. The Dead Sea Scrolls, for example, include counterfeit fragments, whereas Oracle Bones (OB) contain both republished materials and fabricated specimens. Identifying ancient manuscript duplicates is of great significance for both archaeological curation and ancient history study. In this work, we design a progressive OB duplicate discovery framework that combines unsupervised low-level keypoints matching with high-level text-centric content-based matching to refine and rank the candidate OB duplicates with semantic awareness and interpretability. We compare our model with state-of-the-art content-based image retrieval and image matching methods, showing that our model yields comparable recall performance and the highest simplified mean reciprocal rank scores for both Top-5 and Top-15 retrieval results, and with significantly accelerated computation efficiency. We have discovered over 60 pairs of new OB duplicates in real-world deployment, which were missed by domain experts for decades. Code, model and real-world results are available at: https://github.com/cszhangLMU/OBD-Finder/.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Satellite Object Localization with Dilated Convolutions and Attention-aided Spatial Pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object localization in satellite imagery is particularly challenging due to the high variability of objects, low spatial resolution, and interference from noise and dominant features such as clouds and city lights. In this research, we focus on three satellite datasets: upper atmospheric Gravity Waves (GW), mesospheric Bores (Bore), and Ocean Eddies (OE), each presenting its own unique challenges. These challenges include the variability in the scale and appearance of the main object patterns, where the size, shape, and feature extent of objects of interest can differ significantly. To address these challenges, we introduce YOLO-DCAP, a novel enhanced version of YOLOv5 designed to improve object localization in these complex scenarios. YOLO-DCAP incorporates a Multi-scale Dilated Residual Convolution (MDRC) block to capture multi-scale features at scale with varying dilation rates, and an Attention-aided Spatial Pooling (AaSP) module to focus on the global relevant spatial regions, enhancing feature selection. These structural improvements help to better localize objects in satellite imagery. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLO-DCAP significantly outperforms both the YOLO base model and state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average improvement of 20.95% in mAP50 and 32.23% in IoU over the base model, and 7.35% and 9.84% respectively over state-of-the-art alternatives, consistently across all three satellite datasets. These consistent gains across all three satellite datasets highlight the robustness and generalizability of the proposed approach. Our code is open sourced at https://github.com/AI-4-atmosphere-remote-sensing/satellite-object-localization.</description>

      <title>PRUNE: A Patching Based Repair Framework for Certifiable Unlearning of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is often desirable to remove (a.k.a. unlearn) a specific part of the training data from a trained neural network model. A typical application scenario is to protect the data holder's right to be forgotten, which has been promoted by many recent regulation rules. Existing unlearning methods involve training alternative models with remaining data, which may be costly and challenging to verify from the data holder or a thirdparty auditor's perspective. In this work, we provide a new angle and propose a novel unlearning approach by imposing carefully crafted "patch" on the original neural network to achieve targeted "forgetting" of the requested data to delete. Specifically, inspired by the research line of neural network repair, we propose to strategically seek a lightweight minimum "patch" for unlearning a given data point with certifiable guarantee. Furthermore, to unlearn a considerable amount of data points (or an entire class), we propose to iteratively select a small subset of representative data points to unlearn, which achieves the effect of unlearning the whole set. Extensive experiments on multiple categorical datasets demonstrates our approach's effectiveness, achieving measurable unlearning while preserving the model's performance and being competitive in efficiency and memory consumption compared to various baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Aggregating Concepts of Fairness and Accuracy in Prediction Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An algorithm that outputs predictions about the state of the world will almost always be designed with the implicit or explicit goal of outputting accurate predictions (i.e., predictions that are likely to be true). In addition, the rise of increasingly powerful predictive algorithms brought about by the recent revolution in artificial intelligence has led to an emphasis on building predictive algorithms that are fair, in the sense that their predictions do not systematically evince bias or bring about harm to certain individuals or groups. This state of affairs presents two conceptual challenges. First, the goals of accuracy and fairness can sometimes be in tension, and there are no obvious normative guidelines for managing the trade-offs between these two desiderata when they arise. Second, there are many distinct ways of measuring both the accuracy and fairness of a predictive algorithm; here too, there are no obvious guidelines on how to aggregate our preferences for predictive algorithms that satisfy disparate measures of fairness and accuracy to various extents. The goal of this paper is to address these challenges by arguing that there are good reasons for using a linear combination of accuracy and fairness metrics to measure the all-things-considered value of a predictive algorithm for agents who care about both accuracy and fairness. My argument depends crucially on a classic result in the preference aggregation literature due to Harsanyi. After making this formal argument, I apply my result to an analysis of accuracy-fairness trade-offs using the COMPAS dataset compiled by Angwin et al.</description>

      <title>An Exploration of Default Images in Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the creative practice of text-to-image generation (TTI), images are generated from text prompts. However, TTI models are trained to always yield an output, even if the prompt contains unknown terms. In this case, the model may generate what we call "default images": images that closely resemble each other across many unrelated prompts. We argue studying default images is valuable for designing better solutions for TTI and prompt engineering. In this paper, we provide the first investigation into default images on Midjourney, a popular image generator. We describe our systematic approach to create input prompts triggering default images, and present the results of our initial experiments and several small-scale ablation studies. We also report on a survey study investigating how default images affect user satisfaction. Our work lays the foundation for understanding default images in TTI and highlights challenges and future research directions.</description>

      <title>ReviewInstruct: A Review-Driven Multi-Turn Conversations Generation Method for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in conversational AI is hindered by their reliance on single-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data, which limits contextual coherence in multi-turn dialogues. Existing methods for generating multi-turn dialogue data struggle to ensure both diversity and quality in instructions. To address this, we propose Review-Instruct, a novel framework that synthesizes multi-turn conversations through an iterative "Ask-Respond-Review" process involving three agent roles: a Candidate, multiple Reviewers, and a Chairman. The framework iteratively refines instructions by incorporating Reviewer feedback, enhancing dialogue diversity and difficulty. We construct a multi-turn dataset using the Alpaca dataset and fine-tune the LLaMA2-13B model. Evaluations on MT-Bench, MMLU-Pro, and Auto-Arena demonstrate significant improvements, achieving absolute gains of 2.9\% on MMLU-Pro and 2\% on MT-Bench compared to prior state-of-the-art models based on LLaMA2-13B. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the Review stage and the use of multiple Reviewers in boosting instruction diversity and difficulty. Our work highlights the potential of review-driven, multi-agent frameworks for generating high-quality conversational data at scale.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Semantics With Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11764v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) is a linguistic theory based on a universal set of semantic primes: simple, primitive word-meanings that have been shown to exist in most, if not all, languages of the world. According to this framework, any word, regardless of complexity, can be paraphrased using these primes, revealing a clear and universally translatable meaning. These paraphrases, known as explications, can offer valuable applications for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but producing them has traditionally been a slow, manual process. In this work, we present the first study of using large language models (LLMs) to generate NSM explications. We introduce automatic evaluation methods, a tailored dataset for training and evaluation, and fine-tuned models for this task. Our 1B and 8B models outperform GPT-4o in producing accurate, cross-translatable explications, marking a significant step toward universal semantic representation with LLMs and opening up new possibilities for applications in semantic analysis, translation, and beyond.

      <title>Domain Adaptation of VLM for Soccer Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in multi-modal tasks by effectively aligning visual and textual representations. However, most video understanding VLM research has been domain-agnostic, leaving the understanding of their transfer learning capability to specialized domains under-explored. In this work, we address this by exploring the adaptability of open-source VLMs to specific domains, and focusing on soccer as an initial case study. Our approach uses large-scale soccer datasets and LLM to create instruction-following data, and use them to iteratively fine-tune the general-domain VLM in a curriculum learning fashion (first teaching the model key soccer concepts to then question answering tasks). The final adapted model, trained using a curated dataset of 20k video clips, exhibits significant improvement in soccer-specific tasks compared to the base model, with a 37.5% relative improvement for the visual question-answering task and an accuracy improvement from 11.8% to 63.5% for the downstream soccer action classification task.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Inference-Time Scaling via Cyclic Diffusion Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across domains ranging from image synthesis to complex reasoning tasks. However, most inference-time scaling methods rely on fixed denoising schedules, limiting their ability to allocate computation based on instance difficulty or task-specific demands adaptively. We introduce the challenge of adaptive inference-time scaling-dynamically adjusting computational effort during inference-and propose Adaptive Bi-directional Cyclic Diffusion (ABCD), a flexible, search-based inference framework. ABCD refines outputs through bi-directional diffusion cycles while adaptively controlling exploration depth and termination. It comprises three components: Cyclic Diffusion Search, Automatic Exploration-Exploitation Balancing, and Adaptive Thinking Time. Experiments show that ABCD improves performance across diverse tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Better Safe Than Sorry? Overreaction Problem of Vision Language Models in Visual Emergency Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown capabilities in interpreting visual content, but their reliability in safety-critical everyday life scenarios remains insufficiently explored. We introduce VERI (Visual Emergency Recognition Dataset), a diagnostic benchmark comprising 200 images organized into 100 contrastive pairs. Each emergency scene is paired with a visually similar but safe counterpart through human verification and refinement. Using a two-stage evaluation protocol - risk identification and emergency response - we assess 14 VLMs (2B to 124B parameters) across medical emergencies, accidents, and natural disasters. Our analysis reveals an "overreaction problem", where models accurately identify genuine emergencies (70-100 percent success rate) but produce high false-positive rates, misclassifying 31-96 percent of safe situations as dangerous. Ten safe scenarios were universally misclassified by all models regardless of scale. This "better-safe-than-sorry" bias primarily results from contextual overinterpretation (88-93 percent of errors), challenging VLM reliability in safety-critical applications. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in current VLM architectures, which persist despite increased model scale. Our results demonstrate an urgent need for strategies specifically improving contextual reasoning in ambiguous visual situations. The consistently low performance of the model indicates that these data serve effectively as a diagnostic dataset.</description>

      <title>Extended Inductive Reasoning for Personalized Preference Inference from Behavioral Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success in complex reasoning tasks such as math and coding. In contrast to these tasks where deductive reasoning predominates, inductive reasoning-the ability to derive general rules from incomplete evidence, remains underexplored. This paper investigates extended inductive reasoning in LLMs through the lens of personalized preference inference, a critical challenge in LLM alignment where current approaches struggle to capture diverse user preferences. The task demands strong inductive reasoning capabilities as user preferences are typically embedded implicitly across various interaction forms, requiring models to synthesize consistent preference patterns from scattered signals. We propose AlignXplore, a model that leverages extended reasoning chains to enable systematic preference inference from behavioral signals in users' interaction histories. Such explicit preference articulation enables efficient streaming inference: when new behavioral signals emerge, the model can directly build upon previously inferred preference descriptions rather than reprocessing historical signals from scratch, while also supporting iterative refinement to the inferred preferences. We develop AlignXplore by combining cold-start training based on synthetic data with subsequent online reinforcement learning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that AlignXplore achieves substantial improvements over the backbone model by an average of 15.49\% on in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization ability across different input formats and downstream models. Further analyses establish best practices for preference inference learning through systematic comparison of reward modeling strategies, while revealing the emergence of human-like inductive reasoning patterns during training.</description>

      <title>Deep Retrieval at CheckThat! 2025: Identifying Scientific Papers from Implicit Social Media Mentions via Hybrid Retrieval and Re-Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the methodology and results of the Deep Retrieval team for subtask 4b of the CLEF CheckThat! 2025 competition, which focuses on retrieving relevant scientific literature for given social media posts. To address this task, we propose a hybrid retrieval pipeline that combines lexical precision, semantic generalization, and deep contextual re-ranking, enabling robust retrieval that bridges the informal-to-formal language gap. Specifically, we combine BM25-based keyword matching with a FAISS vector store using a fine-tuned INF-Retriever-v1 model for dense semantic retrieval. BM25 returns the top 30 candidates, and semantic search yields 100 candidates, which are then merged and re-ranked via a large language model (LLM)-based cross-encoder.
  Our approach achieves a mean reciprocal rank at 5 (MRR@5) of 76.46% on the development set and 66.43% on the hidden test set, securing the 1st position on the development leaderboard and ranking 3rd on the test leaderboard (out of 31 teams), with a relative performance gap of only 2 percentage points compared to the top-ranked system. We achieve this strong performance by running open-source models locally and without external training data, highlighting the effectiveness of a carefully designed and fine-tuned retrieval pipeline.</description>

      <title>SC-LoRA: Balancing Efficient Fine-tuning and Knowledge Preservation via Subspace-Constrained LoRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, particularly Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), are indispensable for efficiently customizing Large Language Models (LLMs). However, vanilla LoRA suffers from slow convergence speed and knowledge forgetting problems. Recent studies have leveraged the power of designed LoRA initialization, to enhance the fine-tuning efficiency, or to preserve knowledge in the pre-trained LLM. However, none of these works can address the two cases at the same time. To this end, we introduce Subspace-Constrained LoRA (SC-LoRA), a novel LoRA initialization framework engineered to navigate the trade-off between efficient fine-tuning and knowledge preservation. We achieve this by constraining the output of trainable LoRA adapters in a low-rank subspace, where the context information of fine-tuning data is most preserved while the context information of preserved knowledge is least retained, in a balanced way. Such constraint enables the trainable weights to primarily focus on the main features of fine-tuning data while avoiding damaging the preserved knowledge features. We provide theoretical analysis on our method, and conduct extensive experiments including safety preservation and world knowledge preservation, on various downstream tasks. In our experiments, SC-LoRA succeeds in delivering superior fine-tuning performance while markedly diminishing knowledge forgetting, surpassing contemporary LoRA initialization methods.</description>

      <title>Playing with Transformer at 30+ FPS via Next-Frame Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive video models offer distinct advantages over bidirectional diffusion models in creating interactive video content and supporting streaming applications with arbitrary duration. In this work, we present Next-Frame Diffusion (NFD), an autoregressive diffusion transformer that incorporates block-wise causal attention, enabling iterative sampling and efficient inference via parallel token generation within each frame. Nonetheless, achieving real-time video generation remains a significant challenge for such models, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with diffusion sampling and the hardware inefficiencies inherent to autoregressive generation. To address this, we introduce two innovations: (1) We extend consistency distillation to the video domain and adapt it specifically for video models, enabling efficient inference with few sampling steps; (2) To fully leverage parallel computation, motivated by the observation that adjacent frames often share the identical action input, we propose speculative sampling. In this approach, the model generates next few frames using current action input, and discard speculatively generated frames if the input action differs. Experiments on a large-scale action-conditioned video generation benchmark demonstrate that NFD beats autoregressive baselines in terms of both visual quality and sampling efficiency. We, for the first time, achieves autoregressive video generation at over 30 Frames Per Second (FPS) on an A100 GPU using a 310M model.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Information Theoretic Approach to Tractable Probabilistic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By recursively nesting sums and products, probabilistic circuits have emerged in recent years as an attractive class of generative models as they enjoy, for instance, polytime marginalization of random variables. In this work we study these machine learning models using the framework of quantum information theory, leading to the introduction of positive unital circuits (PUnCs), which generalize circuit evaluations over positive real-valued probabilities to circuit evaluations over positive semi-definite matrices. As a consequence, PUnCs strictly generalize probabilistic circuits as well as recently introduced circuit classes such as PSD circuits.</description>

      <title>BiMa: Towards Biases Mitigation for Text-Video Retrieval via Scene Element Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-video retrieval (TVR) systems often suffer from visual-linguistic biases present in datasets, which cause pre-trained vision-language models to overlook key details. To address this, we propose BiMa, a novel framework designed to mitigate biases in both visual and textual representations. Our approach begins by generating scene elements that characterize each video by identifying relevant entities/objects and activities. For visual debiasing, we integrate these scene elements into the video embeddings, enhancing them to emphasize fine-grained and salient details. For textual debiasing, we introduce a mechanism to disentangle text features into content and bias components, enabling the model to focus on meaningful content while separately handling biased information. Extensive experiments and ablation studies across five major TVR benchmarks (i.e., MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo) demonstrate the competitive performance of BiMa. Additionally, the model's bias mitigation capability is consistently validated by its strong results on out-of-distribution retrieval tasks.</description>

      <title>RewardAnything: Generalizable Principle-Following Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reward Models, essential for guiding Large Language Model optimization, are typically trained on fixed preference datasets, resulting in rigid alignment to single, implicit preference distributions. This prevents adaptation to diverse real-world needs-from conciseness in one task to detailed explanations in another. The standard practice of collecting task-specific preference data and retraining reward models is resource-intensive, often producing biased rewards, and limits practical application. We introduce generalizable, principle-following reward models. We propose that RMs should understand and adhere to dynamically provided natural language specifications of reward principles, similar to instruction-following in LLMs. To measure this capability, we develop RABench, a comprehensive benchmark for RMs focusing on generalization across diverse principles. Evaluations on RABench reveal poor generalization of current RMs. As a solution, we present RewardAnything, a novel RM designed and trained to explicitly follow natural language principles. We achieve SotA performance with RewardAnything in traditional RM benchmark simply by specifying a well-defined principle, and results on RABench show we excel in adapting to novel principles without retraining. Furthermore, RewardAnything integrates seamlessly with existing RLHF methods and we show by a case study on how to automatically and efficiently align LLMs with only natural language principles.</description>

      <title>SLAC: Simulation-Pretrained Latent Action Space for Whole-Body Real-World RL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04147v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building capable household and industrial robots requires mastering the control of versatile, high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems such as mobile manipulators. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for autonomously acquiring robot control policies, scaling it to high-DoF embodiments remains challenging. Direct RL in the real world demands both safe exploration and high sample efficiency, which are difficult to achieve in practice. Sim-to-real RL, on the other hand, is often brittle due to the reality gap. This paper introduces SLAC, a method that renders real-world RL feasible for complex embodiments by leveraging a low-fidelity simulator to pretrain a task-agnostic latent action space. SLAC trains this latent action space via a customized unsupervised skill discovery method designed to promote temporal abstraction, disentanglement, and safety, thereby facilitating efficient downstream learning. Once a latent action space is learned, SLAC uses it as the action interface for a novel off-policy RL algorithm to autonomously learn downstream tasks through real-world interactions. We evaluate SLAC against existing methods on a suite of bimanual mobile manipulation tasks, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLAC learns contact-rich whole-body tasks in under an hour of real-world interactions, without relying on any demonstrations or hand-crafted behavior priors.

      <title>HAVIR: HierArchical Vision to Image Reconstruction using CLIP-Guided Versatile Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and multifaceted semantic information.
  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1) The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior, capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing models.</description>

      <title>Recommender systems, stigmergy, and the tyranny of popularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific recommender systems, such as Google Scholar and Web of Science, are essential tools for discovery. Search algorithms that power work through stigmergy, a collective intelligence mechanism that surfaces useful paths through repeated engagement. While generally effective, this "rich-get-richer" dynamic results in a small number of high-profile papers that dominate visibility. This essay argues argue that these algorithm over-reliance on popularity fosters intellectual homogeneity and exacerbates structural inequities, stifling innovative and diverse perspectives critical for scientific progress. We propose an overhaul of search platforms to incorporate user-specific calibration, allowing researchers to manually adjust the weights of factors like popularity, recency, and relevance. We also advise platform developers on how text embeddings and LLMs could be implemented in ways that increase user autonomy. While our suggestions are particularly pertinent to aligning recommender systems with scientific values, these ideas are broadly applicable to information access systems in general. Designing platforms that increase user autonomy is an important step toward more robust and dynamic information</description>

      <title>FinBERT2: A Specialized Bidirectional Encoder for Bridging the Gap in Finance-Specific Deployment of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In natural language processing (NLP), the focus has shifted from encoder-only tiny language models like BERT to decoder-only large language models(LLMs) such as GPT-3. However, LLMs' practical application in the financial sector has revealed three limitations: (1) LLMs often perform worse than fine-tuned BERT on discriminative tasks despite costing much higher computational resources, such as market sentiment analysis in financial reports; (2) Application on generative tasks heavily relies on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods to provide current and specialized information, with general retrievers showing suboptimal performance on domain-specific retrieval tasks; (3) There are additional inadequacies in other feature-based scenarios, such as topic modeling. We introduce FinBERT2, a specialized bidirectional encoder pretrained on a high-quality, financial-specific corpus of 32b tokens. This represents the largest known Chinese financial pretraining corpus for models of this parameter size. As a better backbone, FinBERT2 can bridge the gap in the financial-specific deployment of LLMs through the following achievements: (1) Discriminative fine-tuned models (Fin-Labelers) outperform other (Fin)BERT variants by 0.4%-3.3% and leading LLMs by 9.7%-12.3% on average across five financial classification tasks. (2) Contrastive fine-tuned models (Fin-Retrievers) outperform both open-source (e.g., +6.8\% avg improvement over BGE-base-zh) and proprietary (e.g., +4.2\% avg improvement over OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large) embedders across five financial retrieval tasks; (3) Building on FinBERT2 variants, we construct the Fin-TopicModel, which enables superior clustering and topic representation for financial titles. Our work revisits financial BERT models through comparative analysis with contemporary LLMs and offers practical insights for effectively utilizing FinBERT in the LLMs era.</description>

Abstract: Deploying a Machine Learning (ML) training pipeline into production requires good software engineering practices. Unfortunately, the typical data science workflow often leads to code that lacks critical software quality attributes. This experience report investigates this problem in SPIRA, a project whose goal is to create an ML-Enabled System (MLES) to pre-diagnose insufficiency respiratory via speech analysis. This paper presents an overview of the architecture of the MLES, then compares three versions of its Continuous Training subsystem: from a proof of concept Big Ball of Mud (v1), to a design pattern-based Modular Monolith (v2), to a test-driven set of Microservices (v3) Each version improved its overall extensibility, maintainability, robustness, and resiliency. The paper shares challenges and lessons learned in this process, offering insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to productionize their pipelines.</description>

      <title>Graph-Assisted Stitching for Offline Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing offline hierarchical reinforcement learning methods rely on high-level policy learning to generate subgoal sequences. However, their efficiency degrades as task horizons increase, and they lack effective strategies for stitching useful state transitions across different trajectories. We propose Graph-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel framework that formulates subgoal selection as a graph search problem rather than learning an explicit high-level policy. By embedding states into a Temporal Distance Representation (TDR) space, GAS clusters semantically similar states from different trajectories into unified graph nodes, enabling efficient transition stitching. A shortest-path algorithm is then applied to select subgoal sequences within the graph, while a low-level policy learns to reach the subgoals. To improve graph quality, we introduce the Temporal Efficiency (TE) metric, which filters out noisy or inefficient transition states, significantly enhancing task performance. GAS outperforms prior offline HRL methods across locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks. Notably, in the most stitching-critical task, it achieves a score of 88.3, dramatically surpassing the previous state-of-the-art score of 1.0.

      <title>TrajFlow: Multi-modal Motion Prediction via Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate motion prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and informed decision-making in autonomous driving, particularly under dynamic real-world conditions that necessitate multi-modal forecasts. We introduce TrajFlow, a novel flow matching-based motion prediction framework that addresses the scalability and efficiency challenges of existing generative trajectory prediction methods. Unlike conventional generative approaches that employ i.i.d. sampling and require multiple inference passes to capture diverse outcomes, TrajFlow predicts multiple plausible future trajectories in a single pass, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining coherence across predictions. Moreover, we propose a ranking loss based on the Plackett-Luce distribution to improve uncertainty estimation of predicted trajectories. Additionally, we design a self-conditioning training technique that reuses the model's own predictions to construct noisy inputs during a second forward pass, thereby improving generalization and accelerating inference. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) demonstrate that TrajFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across various key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness for safety-critical autonomous driving applications. The code and other details are available on the project website https://traj-flow.github.io/.</description>

      <title>The Geometries of Truth Are Orthogonal Across Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization capabilities across various tasks, but their claim to practical relevance is still mired by concerns on their reliability. Recent works have proposed examining the activations produced by an LLM at inference time to assess whether its answer to a question is correct. Some works claim that a "geometry of truth" can be learned from examples, in the sense that the activations that generate correct answers can be distinguished from those leading to mistakes with a linear classifier. In this work, we underline a limitation of these approaches: we observe that these "geometries of truth" are intrinsically task-dependent and fail to transfer across tasks. More precisely, we show that linear classifiers trained across distinct tasks share little similarity and, when trained with sparsity-enforcing regularizers, have almost disjoint supports. We show that more sophisticated approaches (e.g., using mixtures of probes and tasks) fail to overcome this limitation, likely because activation vectors commonly used to classify answers form clearly separated clusters when examined across tasks.</description>

      <title>Towards Practical Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis: A Lightweight and Interpretable Spiking Neural Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), especially at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage, is vital yet hindered by subjective assessments and the high cost of multimodal imaging modalities. Although deep learning methods offer automated alternatives, their energy inefficiency and computational demands limit real-world deployment, particularly in resource-constrained settings. As a brain-inspired paradigm, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are inherently well-suited for modeling the sparse, event-driven patterns of neural degeneration in AD, offering a promising foundation for interpretable and low-power medical diagnostics. However, existing SNNs often suffer from weak expressiveness and unstable training, which restrict their effectiveness in complex medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose FasterSNN, a hybrid neural architecture that integrates biologically inspired LIF neurons with region-adaptive convolution and multi-scale spiking attention. This design enables sparse, efficient processing of 3D MRI while preserving diagnostic accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FasterSNN achieves competitive performance with substantially improved efficiency and stability, supporting its potential for practical AD screening.

      <title>HPCTransCompile: An AI Compiler Generated Dataset for High-Performance CUDA Transpilation and LLM Preliminary Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has driven exponential increases in model parameters and computational demands. NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks. However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The speedup ratio of the CPU operators has an average improvemnet of 43.8\%, highlighting the potential of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

      <title>AutoMind: Adaptive Knowledgeable Agent for Automated Data Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.</description>

      <title>LearnAlign: Reasoning Data Selection for Reinforcement Learning in Large Language Models Based on Improved Gradient Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training. To overcome the issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%). Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection. To facilitate future work, we will release code.</description>

      <title>Robust Molecular Property Prediction via Densifying Scarce Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A widely recognized limitation of molecular prediction models is their reliance on structures observed in the training data, resulting in poor generalization to out-of-distribution compounds. Yet in drug discovery, the compounds most critical for advancing research often lie beyond the training set, making the bias toward the training data particularly problematic. This mismatch introduces substantial covariate shift, under which standard deep learning models produce unstable and inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, the scarcity of labeled data, stemming from the onerous and costly nature of experimental validation, further exacerbates the difficulty of achieving reliable generalization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel meta-learning-based approach that leverages unlabeled data to interpolate between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, enabling the model to meta-learn how to generalize beyond the training distribution. We demonstrate significant performance gains on challenging real-world datasets with substantial covariate shift, supported by t-SNE visualizations highlighting our interpolation method.</description>

      <title>Discrete Diffusion in Large Language and Multimodal Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs). Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. Recently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x acceleration in inference speed.
  The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven by progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs and MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and foundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing domain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete diffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and dMLLMs research in early 2025.
  In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative models. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains. We conclude by discussing future directions for research and deployment.

      <title>Casper: Inferring Diverse Intents for Assistive Teleoperation with Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assistive teleoperation, where control is shared between a human and a robot, enables efficient and intuitive human-robot collaboration in diverse and unstructured environments. A central challenge in real-world assistive teleoperation is for the robot to infer a wide range of human intentions from user control inputs and to assist users with correct actions. Existing methods are either confined to simple, predefined scenarios or restricted to task-specific data distributions at training, limiting their support for real-world assistance. We introduce Casper, an assistive teleoperation system that leverages commonsense knowledge embedded in pre-trained visual language models (VLMs) for real-time intent inference and flexible skill execution. Casper incorporates an open-world perception module for a generalized understanding of novel objects and scenes, a VLM-powered intent inference mechanism that leverages commonsense reasoning to interpret snippets of teleoperated user input, and a skill library that expands the scope of prior assistive teleoperation systems to support diverse, long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive empirical evaluation, including human studies and system ablations, demonstrates that Casper improves task performance, reduces human cognitive load, and achieves higher user satisfaction than direct teleoperation and assistive teleoperation baselines.

      <title>Human2LocoMan: Learning Versatile Quadrupedal Manipulation with Human Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots have demonstrated impressive locomotion capabilities in complex environments, but equipping them with autonomous versatile manipulation skills in a scalable way remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment imitation learning system for quadrupedal manipulation, leveraging data collected from both humans and LocoMan, a quadruped equipped with multiple manipulation modes. Specifically, we develop a teleoperation and data collection pipeline, which unifies and modularizes the observation and action spaces of the human and the robot. To effectively leverage the collected data, we propose an efficient modularized architecture that supports co-training and pretraining on structured modality-aligned data across different embodiments. Additionally, we construct the first manipulation dataset for the LocoMan robot, covering various household tasks in both unimanual and bimanual modes, supplemented by a corresponding human dataset. We validate our system on six real-world manipulation tasks, where it achieves an average success rate improvement of 41.9% overall and 79.7% under out-of-distribution (OOD) settings compared to the baseline. Pretraining with human data contributes a 38.6% success rate improvement overall and 82.7% under OOD settings, enabling consistently better performance with only half the amount of robot data.

      <title>RoboMonkey: Scaling Test-Time Sampling and Verification for Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visuomotor control, yet ensuring their robustness in unstructured real-world environments remains a persistent challenge. In this paper, we investigate test-time scaling through the lens of sampling and verification as means to enhance the robustness and generalization of VLAs. We first demonstrate that the relationship between action error and the number of generated samples follows an exponentiated power law across a range of VLAs, indicating the existence of inference-time scaling laws. Building on these insights, we introduce RoboMonkey, a test-time scaling framework for VLAs. At deployment, RoboMonkey samples a small set of actions from a VLA, applies Gaussian perturbation and majority voting to construct an action proposal distribution, and then uses a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based verifier to select the optimal action. We propose a synthetic data generation pipeline for training such VLM-based action verifiers, and demonstrate that scaling the synthetic dataset consistently improves verification and downstream accuracy. Through extensive simulated and hardware experiments, we show that pairing existing VLAs with RoboMonkey yields significant performance gains, achieving a 25% absolute improvement on out-of-distribution tasks and 9% on in-distribution tasks. Additionally, when adapting to new robot setups, we show that fine-tuning both VLAs and action verifiers yields a 7% performance increase compared to fine-tuning VLAs alone.</description>

      <title>Comparative Evaluation of ChatGPT and DeepSeek Across Key NLP Tasks: Strengths, Weaknesses, and Domain-Specific Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP) tasks has sparked significant interest in evaluating their effectiveness across diverse applications. While models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek have shown strong results in many NLP domains, a comprehensive evaluation is needed to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and domain-specific abilities. This is critical as these models are applied to various tasks, from sentiment analysis to more nuanced tasks like textual entailment and translation. This study aims to evaluate ChatGPT and DeepSeek across five key NLP tasks: sentiment analysis, topic classification, text summarization, machine translation, and textual entailment. A structured experimental protocol is used to ensure fairness and minimize variability. Both models are tested with identical, neutral prompts and evaluated on two benchmark datasets per task, covering domains like news, reviews, and formal/informal texts. The results show that DeepSeek excels in classification stability and logical reasoning, while ChatGPT performs better in tasks requiring nuanced understanding and flexibility. These findings provide valuable insights for selecting the appropriate LLM based on task requirements.</description>

      <title>NOVA: Navigation via Object-Centric Visual Autonomy for High-Speed Target Tracking in Unstructured GPS-Denied Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous aerial target tracking in unstructured and GPS-denied environments remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. Many existing methods rely on motion capture systems, pre-mapped scenes, or feature-based localization to ensure safety and control, limiting their deployment in real-world conditions. We introduce NOVA, a fully onboard, object-centric framework that enables robust target tracking and collision-aware navigation using only a stereo camera and an IMU. Rather than constructing a global map or relying on absolute localization, NOVA formulates perception, estimation, and control entirely in the target's reference frame. A tightly integrated stack combines a lightweight object detector with stereo depth completion, followed by histogram-based filtering to infer robust target distances under occlusion and noise. These measurements feed a visual-inertial state estimator that recovers the full 6-DoF pose of the robot relative to the target. A nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) plans dynamically feasible trajectories in the target frame. To ensure safety, high-order control barrier functions are constructed online from a compact set of high-risk collision points extracted from depth, enabling real-time obstacle avoidance without maps or dense representations. We validate NOVA across challenging real-world scenarios, including urban mazes, forest trails, and repeated transitions through buildings with intermittent GPS loss and severe lighting changes that disrupt feature-based localization. Each experiment is repeated multiple times under similar conditions to assess resilience, showing consistent and reliable performance. NOVA achieves agile target following at speeds exceeding 50 km/h. These results show that high-speed vision-based tracking is possible in the wild using only onboard sensing, with no reliance on external localization or environment assumptions.</description>

      <title>Why Do Open-Source LLMs Struggle with Data Analysis? A Systematic Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks, yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate models across three dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Position: Machine Learning Conferences Should Establish a "Refutations and Critiques" Track</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Science progresses by iteratively advancing and correcting humanity's understanding of the world. In machine learning (ML) research, rapid advancements have led to an explosion of publications, but have also led to misleading, incorrect, flawed or perhaps even fraudulent studies being accepted and sometimes highlighted at ML conferences due to the fallibility of peer review. While such mistakes are understandable, ML conferences do not offer robust processes to help the field systematically correct when such errors are made. This position paper argues that ML conferences should establish a dedicated "Refutations and Critiques" (R&amp;C) Track. This R&amp;C Track would provide a high-profile, reputable platform to support vital research that critically challenges prior research, thereby fostering a dynamic self-correcting research ecosystem. We discuss key considerations including track design, review principles, potential pitfalls, and provide an illustrative example submission concerning a recent ICLR 2025 Oral. We conclude that ML conferences should create official, reputable mechanisms to help ML research self-correct.</description>

      <title>Inside you are many wolves: Using cognitive models to interpret value trade-offs in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigating everyday social situations often requires juggling conflicting goals, such as conveying a harsh truth, maintaining trust, all while still being mindful of another person's feelings. These value trade-offs are an integral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools for interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are limited. In cognitive science, so-called "cognitive models" provide formal accounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a speaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In this work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the extent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to systematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings: degrees of reasoning "effort" in frontier black-box models, and RL post-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of higher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in open-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning. Our findings from LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in training with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining data, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. We show that our method is responsive to diverse aspects of the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, with insights for forming hypotheses about other high-level behaviors, shaping training regimes for reasoning models, and better controlling trade-offs between values during model training.</description>

      <title>SEAL: Vision-Language Model-Based Safe End-to-End Cooperative Autonomous Driving with Adaptive Long-Tail Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving technologies face significant safety challenges while operating under rare, diverse, and visually degraded weather scenarios. These challenges become more critical in cooperative settings, where vehicles and infrastructure jointly perceive and reason across complex environments. To address these issues, we propose SEAL, a vision-language model-based framework with adaptive multimodal learning for robust cooperative autonomous driving under long-tail scenarios. SEAL introduces three core innovations: (i) a prompt-driven long-tail scenario generation and evaluation pipeline that leverages foundation models to synthesize realistic long-tail conditions such as snow and fog across vehicle- and infrastructure-side views, enriching training diversity efficiently; (ii) a gated multi-scenario adaptive attention module that modulates the visual stream using scenario priors to recalibrate ambiguous or corrupted features; and (iii) a multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning objective that improves multimodal alignment and promotes cross-scenario feature separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEAL significantly outperforms existing baselines in reasoning, safety, and planning accuracy under complex, challenging driving conditions, advancing the safety, robustness, and scalability of autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding the Cognitive Habits of Large Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which autonomously produce a reasoning Chain of Thought (CoT) before producing final responses, offer a promising approach to interpreting and monitoring model behaviors. Inspired by the observation that certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' -- consistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like cognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of cognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce CogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits. CogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks, and employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit identification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16 widely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that LRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also adaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses further uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit profiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and DeepSeek-R1). Extending the study to safety-related tasks, we observe that certain habits, such as Taking Responsible Risks, are strongly associated with the generation of harmful responses. These findings suggest that studying persistent behavioral patterns in LRMs' CoTs is a valuable step toward deeper understanding of LLM misbehavior.

      <title>EFRame: Deeper Reasoning via Exploration-Filter-Replay Reinforcement Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient variant of PPO that lowers RL's computational cost, still faces limited exploration, low sample efficiency and instability, constraining its performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce EFRame, an Exploration-Filter-Replay framework that systematically augments GRPO along three critical dimensions. EFRame performs additional rollouts to explore high-quality trajectories, applies online filtering to eliminate low-quality samples that introduce noise and variance, and leverages experience replay to repeatedly exploit rare but informative samples. EFRame establishes a complete and stable learning cycle, guiding the model through a structured transition from exploration to convergence. Our experiments across a variety of reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EFRame not only improves the robustness and efficiency of training, but also enables access to deeper reasoning capabilities that remain unattainable under vanilla GRPO. Furthermore, EFRame not only enables fine-grained categorization of training samples for deeper insight into their contributions, but also introduces an efficient and precise mechanism for entropy control, which is critical for balancing exploration and convergence in RL training. Our code is available at https://github.com/597358816/EFRame.</description>

Abstract: Large language models are thought to have potential to aid in medical decision making. We investigate this here. We start with the treatment problem, the patient's core medical decision-making task, which is solved in collaboration with a healthcare provider. We discuss approaches to solving the treatment problem, including -- within evidence-based medicine -- trials and observational data. We then discuss the chat problem, and how this differs from the treatment problem -- in particular as it relates to imitation. We then discuss how a large language model might be used to solve the treatment problem and highlight some of the challenges that emerge. We finally discuss how these challenges relate to evidence-based medicine, and how this might inform next steps.</description>

      <title>CRISP-SAM2: SAM2 with Cross-Modal Interaction and Semantic Prompting for Multi-Organ Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-organ medical segmentation is a crucial component of medical image processing, essential for doctors to make accurate diagnoses and develop effective treatment plans. Despite significant progress in this field, current multi-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details, dependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal Interaction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a promising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual descriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual inputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive cross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into the image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information. To eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting strategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of challenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy for memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical imaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on seven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models. Extensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby confirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations mentioned earlier. Our code is available at: https://github.com/YU-deep/CRISP_SAM2.git.</description>

      <title>Implicit Reward as the Bridge: A Unified View of SFT and DPO Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-training processes are essential phases in grounding pre-trained language models to real-world tasks, with learning from demonstrations or preference signals playing a crucial role in this adaptation. We present a unified theoretical framework bridging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and preference learning in Large Language Model (LLM) post-training. Through rigorous mathematical derivation, we demonstrate that both SFT and preference learning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) operate within the same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT representing a special case of implicit reward learning. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation in conventional SFT: the KL divergence term in distribution matching becomes constant with respect to the policy during optimization, failing to constrain model updates. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective learning rate reduction approach that yields significant performance improvements (up to \textbf{25\%} relative gain and \textbf{6\%} absolute win rate increase in instruction following tasks. Additionally, we derive alternative SFT objectives from various f-divergence functions that preserve the KL term during optimization, further enhancing post-DPO model performance. Finally, we extend the theoretical relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference learning to the SFT context, providing mathematical derivations and experimental validation.</description>

Abstract: Gated Linear Units (GLU) have shown great potential in enhancing neural network performance. In this paper, I introduce a novel attention mechanism called GLU Attention, which introduces nonlinearity into the values of Attention. My experiments demonstrate that GLU Attention improves both model performance and convergence speed across text and vision modalities with zero additional parameters and negligible computational costs. GLU Attention is lightweight and can seamlessly integrate with other technologies, such as Flash Attention, Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), and various Multi-Head Attention (MHA) variants such as Grouped-Query Attention (GQA).

      <description>arXiv:2507.00467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random Forest (RF) is a widely used ensemble learning technique known for its robust classification performance across diverse domains. However, it often relies on hundreds of trees and all input features, leading to high inference cost and model redundancy. In this work, our goal is to grow trees dynamically only on informative features and then enforce maximal diversity by clustering and retaining uncorrelated trees. Therefore, we propose a Refined Random Forest Classifier that iteratively refines itself by first removing the least informative features and then analytically determines how many new trees should be grown, followed by correlation-based clustering to remove redundant trees. The classification accuracy of our model was compared against the standard RF on the same number of trees. Experiments on 8 multiple benchmark datasets, including binary and multiclass datasets, demonstrate that the proposed model achieves improved accuracy compared to standard RF.</description>

Abstract: Humans are able to recognize objects based on both local texture cues and the configuration of object parts, yet contemporary vision models primarily harvest local texture cues, yielding brittle, non-compositional features. Work on shape-vs-texture bias has pitted shape and texture representations in opposition, measuring shape relative to texture, ignoring the possibility that models (and humans) can simultaneously rely on both types of cues, and obscuring the absolute quality of both types of representation. We therefore recast shape evaluation as a matter of absolute configural competence, operationalized by the Configural Shape Score (CSS), which (i) measures the ability to recognize both images in Object-Anagram pairs that preserve local texture while permuting global part arrangement to depict different object categories. Across 86 convolutional, transformer, and hybrid models, CSS (ii) uncovers a broad spectrum of configural sensitivity with fully self-supervised and language-aligned transformers -- exemplified by DINOv2, SigLIP2 and EVA-CLIP -- occupying the top end of the CSS spectrum. Mechanistic probes reveal that (iii) high-CSS networks depend on long-range interactions: radius-controlled attention masks abolish performance showing a distinctive U-shaped integration profile, and representational-similarity analyses expose a mid-depth transition from local to global coding. A BagNet control remains at chance (iv), ruling out "border-hacking" strategies. Finally, (v) we show that configural shape score also predicts other shape-dependent evals. Overall, we propose that the path toward truly robust, generalizable, and human-like vision systems may not lie in forcing an artificial choice between shape and texture, but rather in architectural and learning frameworks that seamlessly integrate both local-texture and global configural shape.</description>

      <title>Horus: A Protocol for Trustless Delegation Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00631v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correctness is an emergent property of systems where exposing error is cheaper than committing it. In dynamic, low-trust environments, autonomous AI agents benefit from delegating work to sub-agents, yet correctness cannot be assured through upfront specification or centralized oversight. We propose a protocol that enforces correctness through collateralized claims in a recursive verification game. Tasks are published as intents, and solvers compete to fulfill them. Selected solvers carry out tasks under risk, with correctness checked post hoc by verifiers. Any challenger can challenge a result by staking against it to trigger the verification process. Incorrect agents are slashed and correct opposition is rewarded, with an escalation path that penalizes erroneous verifiers themselves. When incentives are aligned across solvers, challengers, and verifiers, falsification conditions make correctness the Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>LD-RPS: Zero-Shot Unified Image Restoration via Latent Diffusion Recurrent Posterior Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unified image restoration is a significantly challenging task in low-level vision. Existing methods either make tailored designs for specific tasks, limiting their generalizability across various types of degradation, or rely on training with paired datasets, thereby suffering from closed-set constraints. To address these issues, we propose a novel, dataset-free, and unified approach through recurrent posterior sampling utilizing a pretrained latent diffusion model. Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition. Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent refinement for posterior sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and robustness. Our code and data will be available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/LD-RPS.</description>

      <title>Robotic Manipulation by Imitating Generated Videos Without Physical Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces Robots Imitating Generated Videos (RIGVid), a system that enables robots to perform complex manipulation tasks--such as pouring, wiping, and mixing--purely by imitating AI-generated videos, without requiring any physical demonstrations or robot-specific training. Given a language command and an initial scene image, a video diffusion model generates potential demonstration videos, and a vision-language model (VLM) automatically filters out results that do not follow the command. A 6D pose tracker then extracts object trajectories from the video, and the trajectories are retargeted to the robot in an embodiment-agnostic fashion. Through extensive real-world evaluations, we show that filtered generated videos are as effective as real demonstrations, and that performance improves with generation quality. We also show that relying on generated videos outperforms more compact alternatives such as keypoint prediction using VLMs, and that strong 6D pose tracking outperforms other ways to extract trajectories, such as dense feature point tracking. These findings suggest that videos produced by a state-of-the-art off-the-shelf model can offer an effective source of supervision for robotic manipulation.</description>

      <title>On-Policy Optimization of ANFIS Policies Using Proximal Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning method for training neuro-fuzzy controllers using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Unlike prior approaches that used Deep Q-Networks (DQN) with Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS), our PPO-based framework leverages a stable on-policy actor-critic setup. Evaluated on the CartPole-v1 environment across multiple seeds, PPO-trained fuzzy agents consistently achieved the maximum return of 500 with zero variance after 20000 updates, outperforming ANFIS-DQN baselines in both stability and convergence speed. This highlights PPO's potential for training explainable neuro-fuzzy agents in reinforcement learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Text Detoxification: Data Efficiency, Semantic Preservation and Model Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread dissemination of toxic content on social media poses a serious threat to both online environments and public discourse, highlighting the urgent need for detoxification methods that effectively remove toxicity while preserving the original semantics. However, existing approaches often struggle to simultaneously achieve strong detoxification performance, semantic preservation, and robustness to out-of-distribution data. Moreover, they typically rely on costly, manually annotated parallel corpora while showing poor data efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage training framework that jointly optimizes for data efficiency, semantic preservation, and model generalization. We first perform supervised fine-tuning on a small set of high-quality, filtered parallel data to establish a strong initialization. Then, we leverage unlabeled toxic inputs and a custom-designed reward model to train the LLM using Group Relative Policy Optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the trade-offs faced by previous work, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved generalization and significantly reduced dependence on annotated data.

      <title>GPU-based complete search for nonlinear minimization subject to bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a GPU-based complete search method to enclose the global minimum of a nonlinear function subject to simple bounds on the variables. Using interval analysis, coupled with the computational power and architecture of GPU, the method iteratively rules out the regions in the search domain where the global minimum cannot exist and leaves a finite set of regions where the global minimum must exist. For effectiveness, because of the rigor of interval analysis, the method is guaranteed to enclose the global minimum of the nonlinear function even in the presence of rounding errors. For efficiency, the method employs a novel GPU-based single program, single data parallel programming style to circumvent major GPU performance bottlenecks, and a variable cycling technique is also integrated into the method to reduce computational cost when minimizing large-scale nonlinear functions. The method is validated by minimizing 10 multimodal benchmark test functions with scalable dimensions, including the well-known Ackley function, Griewank function, Levy function, and Rastrigin function. These benchmark test functions represent grand challenges of global optimization, and enclosing the guaranteed global minimum of these benchmark test functions with more than 80 dimensions has not been reported in the literature. Our method completely searches the feasible domain and successfully encloses the guaranteed global minimum of these 10 benchmark test functions with up to 10,000 dimensions using only one GPU in a reasonable computation time, far exceeding the reported results in the literature due to the unique method design and implementation based on GPU architecture.</description>

      <title>AC-DiT: Adaptive Coordination Diffusion Transformer for Mobile Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, mobile manipulation has attracted increasing attention for enabling language-conditioned robotic control in household tasks. However, existing methods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator, primarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly model the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily leads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand, they treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual observation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct multimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile manipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion Transformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination for end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base directly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body conditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion representations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body actions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact of the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at different stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware multimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights between various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features tailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for example, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial for action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric information when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT through extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Order Acquisition Under Competitive Pressure: A Rapidly Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Approach for Ride-Hailing Subsidy Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing aggregator platforms presents significant growth opportunities for ride-service providers by increasing order volume and gross merchandise value (GMV). On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms, service providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and, consequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive ranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt coupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as order volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability. Thus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to market fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints is a critical research challenge. However, existing studies in this area remain scarce.
  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based subsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing adjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition Adaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget constraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape. Furthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment tailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation and benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising real-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse market conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for ride-hailing service providers.</description>

      <title>MAGIC: Mask-Guided Diffusion Inpainting with Multi-Level Perturbations and Context-Aware Alignment for Few-Shot Anomaly Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly tasks.</description>

      <title>Hita: Holistic Tokenizer for Autoregressive Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vanilla autoregressive image generation models generate visual tokens step-by-step, limiting their ability to capture holistic relationships among token sequences. Moreover, because most visual tokenizers map local image patches into latent tokens, global information is limited. To address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens. Hita incorporates two key strategies to better align with the AR generation process: 1) {arranging} a sequential structure with holistic tokens at the beginning, followed by patch-level tokens, and using causal attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) adopting a lightweight fusion module before feeding the de-quantized tokens into the decoder to control information flow and prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID} and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. Detailed analysis of the holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image properties, such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

      <title>DNN-Based Precoding in RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Systems With Practical Phase Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight (LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network (DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase. These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.</description>
