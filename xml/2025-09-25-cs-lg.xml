      <title>Machine Learnability as a Measure of Order in Aperiodic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on the distribution of prime numbers has revealed a dual character: deterministic in definition yet exhibiting statistical behavior reminiscent of random processes. In this paper we show that it is possible to use an image-focused machine learning model to measure the comparative regularity of prime number fields at specific regions of an Ulam spiral. Specifically, we demonstrate that in pure accuracy terms, models trained on blocks extracted from regions of the spiral in the vicinity of 500m outperform models trained on blocks extracted from the region representing integers lower than 25m. This implies existence of more easily learnable order in the former region than in the latter. Moreover, a detailed breakdown of precision and recall scores seem to imply that the model is favouring a different approach to classification in different regions of the spiral, focusing more on identifying prime patterns at lower numbers and more on eliminating composites at higher numbers. This aligns with number theory conjectures suggesting that at higher orders of magnitude we should see diminishing noise in prime number distributions, with averages (density, AP equidistribution) coming to dominate, while local randomness regularises after scaling by log x. Taken together, these findings point toward an interesting possibility: that machine learning can serve as a new experimental instrument for number theory. Notably, the method shows potential 1 for investigating the patterns in strong and weak primes for cryptographic purposes.</description>

      <title>Data Valuation and Selection in a Federated Model Marketplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), marketplaces have become essential platforms for facilitating the exchange of data products to foster data sharing. Model transactions provide economic solutions in data marketplaces that enhance data reusability and ensure the traceability of data ownership. To establish trustworthy data marketplaces, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to enable collaborative learning across siloed datasets while safeguarding data privacy. However, effective data valuation and selection from heterogeneous sources in the FL setup remain key challenges. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework centered on a Wasserstein-based estimator tailored for FL. The estimator not only predicts model performance across unseen data combinations but also reveals the compatibility between data heterogeneity and FL aggregation algorithms. To ensure privacy, we propose a distributed method to approximate Wasserstein distance without requiring access to raw data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that model performance can be reliably extrapolated under the neural scaling law, enabling effective data selection without full-scale training. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios, such as label skew, mislabeled, and unlabeled sources, show that our approach consistently identifies high-performing data combinations, paving the way for more reliable FL-based model marketplaces.</description>

      <title>BULL-ODE: Bullwhip Learning with Neural ODEs and Universal Differential Equations under Stochastic Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study learning of continuous-time inventory dynamics under stochastic demand and quantify when structure helps or hurts forecasting of the bullwhip effect. BULL-ODE compares a fully learned Neural ODE (NODE) that models the entire right-hand side against a physics-informed Universal Differential Equation (UDE) that preserves conservation and order-up-to structure while learning a small residual policy term. Classical supply chain models explain the bullwhip through control/forecasting choices and information sharing, while recent physics-informed and neural differential equation methods blend domain constraints with learned components. It is unclear whether structural bias helps or hinders forecasting under different demand regimes. We address this by using a single-echelon testbed with three demand regimes - AR(1) (autocorrelated), i.i.d. Gaussian, and heavy-tailed lognormal. Training is done on varying fractions of each trajectory, followed by evaluation of multi-step forecasts for inventory I, order rate O, and demand D. Across the structured regimes, UDE consistently generalizes better: with 90% of the training horizon, inventory RMSE drops from 4.92 (NODE) to 0.26 (UDE) under AR(1) and from 5.96 to 0.95 under Gaussian demand. Under heavy-tailed lognormal shocks, the flexibility of NODE is better. These trends persist as train18 ing data shrinks, with NODE exhibiting phase drift in extrapolation while UDE remains stable but underreacts to rare spikes. Our results provide concrete guidance: enforce structure when noise is light-tailed or temporally correlated; relax structure when extreme events dominate. Beyond inventory control, the results offer guidance for hybrid modeling in scientific and engineering systems: enforce known structure when conservation laws and modest noise dominate, and relax structure to capture extremes in settings where rare events drive dynamics.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Transfer Learning for Real-Time Damage Assessment of Bridge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing use of permanent monitoring systems has increased data availability, offering new opportunities for structural assessment but also posing scalability challenges, especially across large bridge networks. Managing multiple structures requires tracking and comparing long-term behaviour efficiently. To address this, knowledge transfer between similar structures becomes essential. This study proposes a model-based transfer learning approach using neural network surrogate models, enabling a model trained on one bridge to be adapted to another with similar characteristics. These models capture shared damage mechanisms, supporting a scalable and generalizable monitoring framework. The method was validated using real data from two bridges. The transferred model was integrated into a Bayesian inference framework for continuous damage assessment based on modal features from monitoring data. Results showed high sensitivity to damage location, severity, and extent. This approach enhances real-time monitoring and enables cross-structure knowledge transfer, promoting smart monitoring strategies and improved resilience at the network level.</description>

      <title>AdaMixT: Adaptive Weighted Mixture of Multi-Scale Expert Transformers for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting involves predicting future values based on historical observations. However, existing approaches primarily rely on predefined single-scale patches or lack effective mechanisms for multi-scale feature fusion. These limitations hinder them from fully capturing the complex patterns inherent in time series, leading to constrained performance and insufficient generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel architecture named Adaptive Weighted Mixture of Multi-Scale Expert Transformers (AdaMixT). Specifically, AdaMixT introduces various patches and leverages both General Pre-trained Models (GPM) and Domain-specific Models (DSM) for multi-scale feature extraction. To accommodate the heterogeneity of temporal features, AdaMixT incorporates a gating network that dynamically allocates weights among different experts, enabling more accurate predictions through adaptive multi-scale fusion. Comprehensive experiments on eight widely used benchmarks, including Weather, Traffic, Electricity, ILI, and four ETT datasets, consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaMixT in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Solve it with EASE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents EASE (Effortless Algorithmic Solution Evolution), an open-source and fully modular framework for iterative algorithmic solution generation leveraging large language models (LLMs). EASE integrates generation, testing, analysis, and evaluation into a reproducible feedback loop, giving users full control over error handling, analysis, and quality assessment. Its architecture supports the orchestration of multiple LLMs in complementary roles-such as generator, analyst, and evaluator. By abstracting the complexity of prompt design and model management, EASE provides a transparent and extensible platform for researchers and practitioners to co-design algorithms and other generative solutions across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Classification of Vessel Types in Straits Using AIS Tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate recognition of vessel types from Automatic Identification System (AIS) tracks is essential for safety oversight and combating illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) activity. This paper presents a strait-scale, machine-learning pipeline that classifies moving vessels using only AIS data. We analyze eight days of historical AIS from the Danish Maritime Authority covering the Bornholm Strait in the Baltic Sea (January 22-30, 2025). After forward/backward filling voyage records, removing kinematic and geospatial outliers, and segmenting per-MMSI tracks while excluding stationary periods ($\ge 1$ h), we derive 31 trajectory-level features spanning kinematics (e.g., SOG statistics), temporal, geospatial (Haversine distances, spans), and ship-shape attributes computed from AIS A/B/C/D reference points (length, width, aspect ratio, bridge-position ratio). To avoid leakage, we perform grouped train/test splits by MMSI and use stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Across five classes (cargo, tanker, passenger, high-speed craft, fishing; N=1{,}910 trajectories; test=382), tree-based models dominate: a Random Forest with SMOTE attains 92.15% accuracy (macro-precision 94.11%, macro-recall 92.51%, macro-F1 93.27%) on the held-out test set, while a tuned RF reaches one-vs-rest ROC-AUC up to 0.9897. Feature-importance analysis highlights the bridge-position ratio and maximum SOG as the most discriminative signals; principal errors occur between cargo and tanker, reflecting similar transit behavior. We demonstrate operational value by backfilling missing ship types on unseen data and discuss improvements such as DBSCAN based trip segmentation and gradient-boosted ensembles to handle frequent-stop ferries and further lift performance. The results show that lightweight features over AIS trajectories enable real-time vessel type classification in straits.</description>

      <title>Localized PCA-Net Neural Operators for Scalable Solution Reconstruction of Elliptic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operator learning has emerged as a powerful approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in a data-driven manner. However, applying principal component analysis (PCA) to high-dimensional solution fields incurs significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose a patch-based PCA-Net framework that decomposes the solution fields into smaller patches, applies PCA within each patch, and trains a neural operator in the reduced PCA space. We investigate two different patch-based approaches that balance computational efficiency and reconstruction accuracy: (1) local-to-global patch PCA, and (2) local-to-local patch PCA. The trade-off between computational cost and accuracy is analyzed, highlighting the advantages and limitations of each approach. Furthermore, within each approach, we explore two refinements for the most computationally efficient method: (i) introducing overlapping patches with a smoothing filter and (ii) employing a two-step process with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for refinement. Our results demonstrate that patch-based PCA significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy, reducing end-to-end pipeline processing time by a factor of 3.7 to 4 times compared to global PCA, thefore making it a promising technique for efficient operator learning in PDE-based systems.</description>

      <title>Prompt Optimization Meets Subspace Representation Learning for Few-shot Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in open-world settings depends heavily on their ability to flag out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs unseen during training. Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled promising few-shot OOD detection frameworks using only a handful of in-distribution (ID) samples. However, existing prompt learning-based OOD methods rely solely on softmax probabilities, overlooking the rich discriminative potential of the feature embeddings learned by VLMs trained on millions of samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel context optimization (CoOp)-based framework that integrates subspace representation learning with prompt tuning. Our approach improves ID-OOD separability by projecting the ID features into a subspace spanned by prompt vectors, while projecting ID-irrelevant features into an orthogonal null space. To train such OOD detection framework, we design an easy-to-handle end-to-end learning criterion that ensures strong OOD detection performance as well as high ID classification accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets showcase the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Large language models surpass domain-specific architectures for antepartum electronic fetal monitoring analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across diverse domains through training on massive datasets. These models have demonstrated exceptional performance in healthcare applications, yet their potential for electronic fetal monitoring (EFM)/cardiotocography (CTG) analysis, a critical technology for evaluating fetal well-being, remains largely underexplored. Antepartum CTG interpretation presents unique challenges due to the complex nature of fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns and uterine activity, requiring sophisticated analysis of long time-series data. The assessment of CTG is heavily based on subjective clinical interpretation, often leading to variability in diagnostic accuracy and deviation from timely pregnancy care. This study presents the first comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art AI approaches for automated antepartum CTG analysis. We systematically compare time-series FMs and LLMs against established CTG-specific architectures. Our evaluation encompasses over 500 CTG recordings of varying durations reflecting real-world clinical recordings, providing robust performance benchmarks across different modelling paradigms. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve superior performance compared to both foundation models and domain-specific approaches, offering a promising alternative pathway for clinical CTG interpretation. These findings provide critical insights into the relative strengths of different AI methodologies for fetal monitoring applications and establish a foundation for future clinical AI development in prenatal care.</description>

      <title>A Study of Skews, Imbalances, and Pathological Conditions in LLM Inference Deployment on GPU Clusters detectable from DPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive inference in large transformer-based language models (LLMs) presents significant challenges for runtime efficiency, particularly during the decode phase where load imbalance across GPU shards can cause throughput degradation and latency spikes. A DPU-assisted framework leveraged by BlueField-3 Data Processing Units can enable real-time detection and mitigation of load imbalance in multi-node tensor-parallel inference. By offloading monitoring tasks to the DPU and analyzing GPU telemetry and inter-node communication patterns, the resulting system can provide actionable feedback to inference controllers and schedulers. The goal of this study is three-fold i) identify the reported skews/imbalances/pathological conditions that arise in muti-GPU execution of a) LLM tensor computing (both during training and inference), b) identify their impact on computational performance, and c) make a critical assessment if those can be tracked for potential mitigation from a DPU network.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable and Structured Spatiotemporal Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial Balance Attention block for spatiotemporal forecasting. To strike a balance between obeying spatial proximity and capturing global correlation, we partition the spatial graph into a set of subgraphs and instantiate Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local spatial correlation within each subgraph; to capture the global spatial correlation, we further aggregate the nodes to produce subgraph representations and achieve message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph Attention. Building on the proposed Spatial Balance Attention block, we develop a multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting model by progressively increasing the subgraph scales. The resulting model is both scalable and able to produce structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it is easy to implement. We evaluate its efficacy and efficiency against the existing models on real-world spatiotemporal datasets from medium to large sizes. The experimental results show that it can achieve performance improvements up to 7.7% over the baseline methods at low running costs.</description>

      <title>Amortized Latent Steering: Low-Cost Alternative to Test-Time Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time optimization remains impractical at scale due to prohibitive inference costs\textemdash techniques like iterative refinement and multi-step verification can require $10$--$100\times$ more compute per query than standard decoding. Latent space test-time optimization methods like LatentSeek offer a more direct approach by steering hidden representations, but still demand expensive per-query optimization loops with multiple backward passes. We propose Amortized Latent Steering (ALS), which collapses this iterative optimization into a single offline-computed vector applied at constant cost during inference. ALS computes the mean difference between hidden states from successful versus unsuccessful generations, then uses this direction to calibrate the model's hidden representations: when decoding drifts away from the success manifold, ALS nudges activations back toward it. Across GSM8K and MATH-$500$ benchmarks, ALS achieves $2$--$5\times$ speedup over iterative methods while matching or surpassing greedy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Consistency baselines, yielding up to 101\% improvement in efficiency--accuracy trade-off. These results show that much of latent optimization's benefit can be captured offline, making sophisticated reasoning techniques viable for production deployment.

      <title>Robust and continuous machine learning of usage habits to adapt digital interfaces to user needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a machine learning approach to design digital interfaces that can dynamically adapt to different users and usage strategies. The algorithm uses Bayesian statistics to model users' browsing behavior, focusing on their habits rather than group preferences. It is distinguished by its online incremental learning, allowing reliable predictions even with little data and in the case of a changing environment. This inference method generates a task model, providing a graphical representation of navigation with the usage statistics of the current user. The algorithm learns new tasks while preserving prior knowledge. The theoretical framework is described, and simulations show the effectiveness of the approach in stationary and non-stationary environments. In conclusion, this research paves the way for adaptive systems that improve the user experience by helping them to better navigate and act on their interface.</description>

      <title>Decentor-V: Lightweight ML Training on Low-Power RISC-V Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern IoT devices increasingly rely on machine learning solutions to process data locally. However, the lack of graphics processing units (GPUs) or dedicated accelerators on most platforms makes on-device training largely infeasible, often requiring cloud-based services to perform this task. This procedure often raises privacy-related concerns, and creates dependency on reliable and always-on connectivity. Federated Learning (FL) is a new trend that addresses these issues by enabling decentralized and collaborative training directly on devices, but it requires highly efficient optimization algorithms. L-SGD, a lightweight variant of stochastic gradient descent, has enabled neural network training on Arm Cortex-M Microcontroller Units (MCUs). This work extends L-SGD to RISC-V-based MCUs, an open and emerging architecture that still lacks robust support for on-device training. L-SGD was evaluated on both Arm and RISC-V platforms using 32-bit floating-point arithmetic, highlighting the performance impact of the absence of Floating-Point Units (FPUs) in RISC-V MCUs. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce an 8-bit quantized version of L-SGD for RISC-V, which achieves nearly 4x reduction in memory usage and a 2.2x speedup in training time, with negligible accuracy degradation.</description>

      <title>MobileRL: Online Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Mobile GUI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building general-purpose graphical user interface (GUI) agents has become increasingly promising with the progress in vision language models. However, developing effective mobile GUI agents with reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to the heavy-tailed distribution of task difficulty and the inefficiency of large-scale environment sampling. We present an online agentic reinforcement learning framework MOBILERL to enhance GUI agents in mobile environments. Its core component is the Difficulty-Adaptive GRPO (ADAGRPO) algorithm. In ADAGRPO, we design difficulty-adaptive positive replay and failure curriculum filtering to adapt the model to different task difficulties. We introduce the shortest path reward adjustment strategy to reshape rewards concerning the task length in multi-turn agentic tasks. Those strategies jointly stabilize RL training, improve sample efficiency, and generate strong performance across diverse mobile apps and tasks. We apply MOBILERL to two open models (Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and GLM-4.1V-9B-Base). The resultant MOBILERL-9B model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of success rates on both AndroidWorld (75.8%) and AndroidLab (46.8%). The MOBILERL framework is adopted in the AutoGLM products, and also open-sourced at https://github.com/THUDM/MobileRL.</description>

      <title>A Coopetitive-Compatible Data Generation Framework for Cross-silo Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (CFL) enables organizations (e.g., hospitals or banks) to collaboratively train artificial intelligence (AI) models while preserving data privacy by keeping data local. While prior work has primarily addressed statistical heterogeneity across organizations, a critical challenge arises from economic competition, where organizations may act as market rivals, making them hesitant to participate in joint training due to potential utility loss (i.e., reduced net benefit). Furthermore, the combined effects of statistical heterogeneity and inter-organizational competition on organizational behavior and system-wide social welfare remain underexplored. In this paper, we propose CoCoGen, a coopetitive-compatible data generation framework, leveraging generative AI (GenAI) and potential game theory to model, analyze, and optimize collaborative learning under heterogeneous and competitive settings. Specifically, CoCoGen characterizes competition and statistical heterogeneity through learning performance and utility-based formulations and models each training round as a weighted potential game. We then derive GenAI-based data generation strategies that maximize social welfare. Experimental results on the Fashion-MNIST dataset reveal how varying heterogeneity and competition levels affect organizational behavior and demonstrate that CoCoGen consistently outperforms baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Coffee Ratings Based On Influential Attributes Using SelectKBest and Optimal Hyperparameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the application of supervised machine learning algorithms to predict coffee ratings based on a combination of influential textual and numerical attributes extracted from user reviews. Through careful data preprocessing including text cleaning, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and selection with SelectKBest, the study identifies key factors contributing to coffee quality assessments. Six models (Decision Tree, KNearest Neighbors, Multi-layer Perceptron, Random Forest, Extra Trees, and XGBoost) were trained and evaluated using optimized hyperparameters. Model performance was assessed primarily using F1-score, Gmean, and AUC metrics. Results demonstrate that ensemble methods (Extra Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost), as well as Multi-layer Perceptron, consistently outperform simpler classifiers (Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors) in terms of evaluation metrics such as F1 scores, G-mean and AUC. The findings highlight the essence of rigorous feature selection and hyperparameter tuning in building robust predictive systems for sensory product evaluation, offering a data driven approach to complement traditional coffee cupping by expertise of trained professionals.</description>

      <title>NurseSchedRL: Attention-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Nurse-Patient Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Healthcare systems face increasing pressure to allocate limited nursing resources efficiently while accounting for skill heterogeneity, patient acuity, staff fatigue, and continuity of care. Traditional optimization and heuristic scheduling methods struggle to capture these dynamic, multi-constraint environments. I propose NurseSchedRL, a reinforcement learning framework for nurse-patient assignment that integrates structured state encoding, constrained action masking, and attention-based representations of skills, fatigue, and geographical context. NurseSchedRL uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with feasibility masks to ensure assignments respect real-world constraints, while dynamically adapting to patient arrivals and varying nurse availability. In simulation with realistic nurse and patient data, NurseSchedRL achieves improved scheduling efficiency, better alignment of skills to patient needs, and reduced fatigue compared to baseline heuristic and unconstrained RL approaches. These results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning for decision support in complex, high-stakes healthcare workforce management.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection in Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Using Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized training framework widely used in IoT ecosystems that preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, making it ideal for IoT-enabled cyber-physical systems with sensing and communication like Smart Grids (SGs), Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV), and Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS). With the rapid expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure, securing these IoT-based charging stations against cyber threats has become critical. Centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) raise privacy concerns due to sensitive network and user data, making FL a promising alternative. However, current FL-based IDS evaluations overlook practical challenges such as system heterogeneity and non-IID data. To address these challenges, we conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of federated learning for anomaly detection in EV charging stations under system and data heterogeneity. We used FedAvg and FedAvgM, widely studied optimization approaches, to analyze their effectiveness in anomaly detection. Under IID settings, FedAvg achieves superior performance to centralized models using the same neural network. However, performance degrades with non-IID data and system heterogeneity. FedAvgM consistently outperforms FedAvg in heterogeneous settings, showing better convergence and higher anomaly detection accuracy. Our results demonstrate that FL can handle heterogeneity in IoT-based EVCS without significant performance loss, with FedAvgM as a promising solution for robust, privacy-preserving EVCS security.</description>

      <title>Safe-SAIL: Towards a Fine-grained Safety Landscape of Large Language Models via Sparse Autoencoder Interpretation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications raises significant safety concerns. Most existing safety research focuses on evaluating LLM outputs or specific safety tasks, limiting their ability to ad- dress broader, undefined risks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) facilitate interpretability research to clarify model behavior by explaining single-meaning atomic features decomposed from entangled signals. jHowever, prior applications on SAEs do not interpret features with fine-grained safety-related con- cepts, thus inadequately addressing safety-critical behaviors, such as generating toxic responses and violating safety regu- lations. For rigorous safety analysis, we must extract a rich and diverse set of safety-relevant features that effectively capture these high-risk behaviors, yet face two challenges: identifying SAEs with the greatest potential for generating safety concept-specific neurons, and the prohibitively high cost of detailed feature explanation. In this paper, we pro- pose Safe-SAIL, a framework for interpreting SAE features within LLMs to advance mechanistic understanding in safety domains. Our approach systematically identifies SAE with best concept-specific interpretability, explains safety-related neurons, and introduces efficient strategies to scale up the in- terpretation process. We will release a comprehensive toolkit including SAE checkpoints and human-readable neuron ex- planations, which supports empirical analysis of safety risks to promote research on LLM safety.</description>

      <title>Accounting for Uncertainty in Machine Learning Surrogates: A Gauss-Hermite Quadrature Approach to Reliability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning surrogates are increasingly employed to replace expensive computational models for physics-based reliability analysis. However, their use introduces epistemic uncertainty from model approximation errors, which couples with aleatory uncertainty in model inputs, potentially compromising the accuracy of reliability predictions. This study proposes a Gauss-Hermite quadrature approach to decouple these nested uncertainties and enable more accurate reliability analysis. The method evaluates conditional failure probabilities under aleatory uncertainty using First and Second Order Reliability Methods and then integrates these probabilities across realizations of epistemic uncertainty. Three examples demonstrate that the proposed approach maintains computational efficiency while yielding more trustworthy predictions than traditional methods that ignore model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Research on Metro Transportation Flow Prediction Based on the STL-GRU Combined Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the metro intelligent transportation system, accurate transfer passenger flow prediction is a key link in optimizing operation plans and improving transportation efficiency. To further improve the theory of metro internal transfer passenger flow prediction and provide more reliable support for intelligent operation decisions, this paper innovatively proposes a metro transfer passenger flow prediction model that integrates the Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) method and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).In practical application, the model first relies on the deep learning library Keras to complete the construction and training of the GRU model, laying the foundation for subsequent prediction; then preprocesses the original metro card swiping data, uses the graph-based depth-first search algorithm to identify passengers' travel paths, and further constructs the transfer passenger flow time series; subsequently adopts the STL time series decomposition algorithm to decompose the constructed transfer passenger flow time series into trend component, periodic component and residual component, and uses the 3{\sigma} principle to eliminate and fill the outliers in the residual component, and finally completes the transfer passenger flow prediction.Taking the transfer passenger flow data of a certain metro station as the research sample, the validity of the model is verified. The results show that compared with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and the combined model of STL time series decomposition method and Long Short-Term Memory (STL-LSTM), the STL-GRU combined prediction model significantly improves the prediction accuracy of transfer passenger flow on weekdays (excluding Fridays), Fridays and rest days, with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the prediction results reduced by at least 2.3, 1.36 and 6.42 percentage points respectively.</description>

      <title>Two ways to knowledge?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the weight matrices of transformer-based machine learning applications to the solution of two representative physical applications show a random-like character which bears no directly recognizable link to the physical and mathematical structure of the physical problem under study. This suggests that machine learning and the scientific method may represent two distinct and potentially complementary paths to knowledge, even though a strict notion of explainability in terms of direct correspondence between network parameters and physical structures may remain out of reach. It is also observed that drawing a parallel between transformer operation and (generalized) path-integration techniques may account for the random-like nature of the weights, but still does not resolve the tension with explainability. We conclude with some general comments on the hazards of gleaning knowledge without the benefit of Insight.</description>

      <title>Self-Evolving LLMs via Continual Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world industrial settings, large language models (LLMs) must learn continually to keep pace with diverse and evolving tasks, requiring self-evolution to refine knowledge under dynamic data distributions. However, existing continual learning (CL) approaches, such as replay and parameter isolation, often suffer from catastrophic forgetting: training on new tasks degrades performance on earlier ones by overfitting to the new distribution and weakening generalization.We propose MoE-CL, a parameter-efficient adversarial mixture-of-experts framework for industrial-scale, self-evolving continual instruction tuning of LLMs. MoE-CL uses a dual-expert design: (1) a dedicated LoRA expert per task to preserve task-specific knowledge via parameter independence, mitigating forgetting; and (2) a shared LoRA expert to enable cross-task transfer. To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the shared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The discriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned information during sequential training. Through adversarial learning, the shared expert acquires generalized representations that mimic the discriminator, while dedicated experts retain task-specific details, balancing knowledge retention and cross-task generalization and thereby supporting self-evolution.Extensive experiments on the public MTL5 benchmark and an industrial Tencent3 benchmark validate the effectiveness of MoE-CL for continual instruction tuning. In real-world A/B testing for content compliance review on the Tencent Video platform, MoE-CL reduced manual review costs by 15.3%. These results demonstrate that MoE-CL is practical for large-scale industrial deployment where continual adaptation and stable transfer are critical.</description>

      <title>A Weighted Gradient Tracking Privacy-Preserving Method for Distributed Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the privacy-preserving distributed optimization problem, aiming to protect agents' private information from potential attackers during the optimization process. Gradient tracking, an advanced technique for improving the convergence rate in distributed optimization, has been applied to most first-order algorithms in recent years. We first reveal the inherent privacy leakage risk associated with gradient tracking. Building upon this insight, we propose a weighted gradient tracking distributed privacy-preserving algorithm, eliminating the privacy leakage risk in gradient tracking using decaying weight factors. Then, we characterize the convergence of the proposed algorithm under time-varying heterogeneous step sizes. We prove the proposed algorithm converges precisely to the optimal solution under mild assumptions. Finally, numerical simulations validate the algorithm's effectiveness through a classical distributed estimation problem and the distributed training of a convolutional neural network.</description>

      <title>SDGF: Fusing Static and Multi-Scale Dynamic Correlations for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inter-series correlations are crucial for accurate multivariate time series forecasting, yet these relationships often exhibit complex dynamics across different temporal scales. Existing methods are limited in modeling these multi-scale dependencies and struggle to capture their intricate and evolving nature. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Static-Dynamic Graph Fusion network (SDGF), whose core lies in capturing multi-scale inter-series correlations through a dual-path graph structure learning approach. Specifically, the model utilizes a static graph based on prior knowledge to anchor long-term, stable dependencies, while concurrently employing Multi-level Wavelet Decomposition to extract multi-scale features for constructing an adaptively learned dynamic graph to capture associations at different scales. We design an attention-gated module to fuse these two complementary sources of information intelligently, and a multi-kernel dilated convolutional network is then used to deepen the understanding of temporal patterns. Comprehensive experiments on multiple widely used real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.</description>

      <title>From Parameters to Performance: A Data-Driven Study on LLM Structure and Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, driving significant technological advancements and innovations. Despite the rapid growth in model scale and capability, systematic, data-driven research on how structural configurations affect performance remains scarce. To address this gap, we present a large-scale dataset encompassing diverse open-source LLM structures and their performance across multiple benchmarks. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct a systematic, data mining-driven analysis to validate and quantify the relationship between structural configurations and performance. Our study begins with a review of the historical development of LLMs and an exploration of potential future trends. We then analyze how various structural choices impact performance across benchmarks and further corroborate our findings using mechanistic interpretability techniques. By providing data-driven insights into LLM optimization, our work aims to guide the targeted development and application of future models. We will release our dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/DX0369/LLM-Structure-Performance-Dataset</description>

      <title>LoRALib: A Standardized Benchmark for Evaluating LoRA-MoE Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) can save significant costs in storage and computing, but its strong adaptability to a single task is often accompanied by insufficient cross-task generalization capabilities. To improve this, existing work combines LoRA with mixture-of-experts (MoE) to enhance the model's adaptability through expert modules and routing mechanisms. However, existing LoRA-MoE methods lack unified standards in models, datasets, hyperparameters, and evaluation methods, making it difficult to conduct fair comparisons between different methods. To this end, we proposed a unified benchmark named LoRALib. Specifically, we standardized datasets from $40$ downstream tasks into a unified format, fine-tuned them using the same hyperparameters and obtained $680$ LoRA modules across $17$ model architectures. Based on this LoRA library, we conduct large-scale experiments on $3$ representative LoRA-MoE methods and different LoRA selection mechanisms using the open-sourced testing tool OpenCompass.

      <title>Rank-Induced PL Mirror Descent: A Rank-Faithful Second-Order Algorithm for Sleeping Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm, \emph{Rank-Induced Plackett--Luce Mirror Descent (RIPLM)}, which leverages the structural equivalence between the \emph{rank benchmark} and the \emph{distributional benchmark} established in \citet{BergamOzcanHsu2022}. Unlike prior approaches that operate on expert identities, RIPLM updates directly in the \emph{rank-induced Plackett--Luce (PL)} parameterization. This ensures that the algorithm's played distributions remain within the class of rank-induced distributions at every round, preserving the equivalence with the rank benchmark. To our knowledge, RIPLM is the first algorithm that is both (i) \emph{rank-faithful} and (ii) \emph{variance-adaptive} in the sleeping experts setting.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of FOLD-SE vs. FOLD-R++ in Binary Classification and XGBoost in Multi-Category Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the demand for Machine Learning (ML) models that can balance accuracy, efficiency, and interpreability has grown significantly. Traditionally, there has been a tradeoff between accuracy and explainability in predictive models, with models such as Neural Networks achieving high accuracy on complex datasets while sacrificing internal transparency. As such, new rule-based algorithms such as FOLD-SE have been developed that provide tangible justification for predictions in the form of interpretable rule sets. The primary objective of this study was to compare FOLD-SE and FOLD-R++, both rule-based classifiers, in binary classification and evaluate how FOLD-SE performs against XGBoost, a widely used ensemble classifier, when applied to multi-category classification. We hypothesized that because FOLD-SE can generate a condensed rule set in a more explainable manner, it would lose upwards of an average of 3 percent in accuracy and F1 score when compared with XGBoost and FOLD-R++ in multiclass and binary classification, respectively. The research used data collections for classification, with accuracy, F1 scores, and processing time as the primary performance measures. Outcomes show that FOLD-SE is superior to FOLD-R++ in terms of binary classification by offering fewer rules but losing a minor percentage of accuracy and efficiency in processing time; in tasks that involve multi-category classifications, FOLD-SE is more precise and far more efficient compared to XGBoost, in addition to generating a comprehensible rule set. The results point out that FOLD-SE is a better choice for both binary tasks and classifications with multiple categories. Therefore, these results demonstrate that rule-based approaches like FOLD-SE can bridge the gap between explainability and performance, highlighting their potential as viable alternatives to black-box models in diverse classification tasks.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Framework for Pathway-Driven Therapeutic Target Discovery in Metabolic Disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metabolic disorders, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), represent a significant global health burden, disproportionately impacting genetically predisposed populations such as the Pima Indians (a Native American tribe from south central Arizona). This study introduces a novel machine learning (ML) framework that integrates predictive modeling with gene-agnostic pathway mapping to identify high-risk individuals and uncover potential therapeutic targets. Using the Pima Indian dataset, logistic regression and t-tests were applied to identify key predictors of T2DM, yielding an overall model accuracy of 78.43%. To bridge predictive analytics with biological relevance, we developed a pathway mapping strategy that links identified predictors to critical signaling networks, including insulin signaling, AMPK, and PPAR pathways. This approach provides mechanistic insights without requiring direct molecular data. Building upon these connections, we propose therapeutic strategies such as dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists, AMPK activators, SIRT1 modulators, and phytochemical, further validated through pathway enrichment analyses. Overall, this framework advances precision medicine by offering interpretable and scalable solutions for early detection and targeted intervention in metabolic disorders. The key contributions of this work are: (1) development of an ML framework combining logistic regression and principal component analysis (PCA) for T2DM risk prediction; (2) introduction of a gene-agnostic pathway mapping approach to generate mechanistic insights; and (3) identification of novel therapeutic strategies tailored for high-risk populations.</description>

      <title>KM-GPT: An Automated Pipeline for Reconstructing Individual Patient Data from Kaplan-Meier Plots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing individual patient data (IPD) from Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots provides valuable insights for evidence synthesis in clinical research. However, existing approaches often rely on manual digitization, which is error-prone and lacks scalability. To address these limitations, we develop KM-GPT, the first fully automated, AI-powered pipeline for reconstructing IPD directly from KM plots with high accuracy, robustness, and reproducibility. KM-GPT integrates advanced image preprocessing, multi-modal reasoning powered by GPT-5, and iterative reconstruction algorithms to generate high-quality IPD without manual input or intervention. Its hybrid reasoning architecture automates the conversion of unstructured information into structured data flows and validates data extraction from complex KM plots. To improve accessibility, KM-GPT is equipped with a user-friendly web interface and an integrated AI assistant, enabling researchers to reconstruct IPD without requiring programming expertise. KM-GPT was rigorously evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, consistently demonstrating superior accuracy. To illustrate its utility, we applied KM-GPT to a meta-analysis of gastric cancer immunotherapy trials, reconstructing IPD to facilitate evidence synthesis and biomarker-based subgroup analyses. By automating traditionally manual processes and providing a scalable, web-based solution, KM-GPT transforms clinical research by leveraging reconstructed IPD to enable more informed downstream analyses, supporting evidence-based decision-making.</description>

      <title>AdaSTI: Conditional Diffusion Models with Adaptive Dependency Modeling for Spatio-Temporal Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal data abounds in domain like traffic and environmental monitoring. However, it often suffers from missing values due to sensor malfunctions, transmission failures, etc. Recent years have seen continued efforts to improve spatio-temporal data imputation performance. Recently diffusion models have outperformed other approaches in various tasks, including spatio-temporal imputation, showing competitive performance. Extracting and utilizing spatio-temporal dependencies as conditional information is vital in diffusion-based methods. However, previous methods introduce error accumulation in this process and ignore the variability of the dependencies in the noisy data at different diffusion steps. In this paper, we propose AdaSTI (Adaptive Dependency Model in Diffusion-based Spatio-Temporal Imputation), a novel spatio-temporal imputation approach based on conditional diffusion model. Inside AdaSTI, we propose a BiS4PI network based on a bi-directional S4 model for pre-imputation with the imputed result used to extract conditional information by our designed Spatio-Temporal Conditionalizer (STC)network. We also propose a Noise-Aware Spatio-Temporal (NAST) network with a gated attention mechanism to capture the variant dependencies across diffusion steps. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that AdaSTI outperforms existing methods in all the settings, with up to 46.4% reduction in imputation error.</description>

      <title>Early Prediction of Multi-Label Care Escalation Triggers in the Intensive Care Unit Using Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients often present with complex, overlapping signs of physiological deterioration that require timely escalation of care. Traditional early warning systems, such as SOFA or MEWS, are limited by their focus on single outcomes and fail to capture the multi-dimensional nature of clinical decline. This study proposes a multi-label classification framework to predict Care Escalation Triggers (CETs), including respiratory failure, hemodynamic instability, renal compromise, and neurological deterioration, using the first 24 hours of ICU data. Using the MIMIC-IV database, CETs are defined through rule-based criteria applied to data from hours 24 to 72 (for example, oxygen saturation below 90, mean arterial pressure below 65 mmHg, creatinine increase greater than 0.3 mg/dL, or a drop in Glasgow Coma Scale score greater than 2). Features are extracted from the first 24 hours and include vital sign aggregates, laboratory values, and static demographics. We train and evaluate multiple classification models on a cohort of 85,242 ICU stays (80 percent training: 68,193; 20 percent testing: 17,049). Evaluation metrics include per-label precision, recall, F1-score, and Hamming loss. XGBoost, the best performing model, achieves F1-scores of 0.66 for respiratory, 0.72 for hemodynamic, 0.76 for renal, and 0.62 for neurologic deterioration, outperforming baseline models. Feature analysis shows that clinically relevant parameters such as respiratory rate, blood pressure, and creatinine are the most influential predictors, consistent with the clinical definitions of the CETs. The proposed framework demonstrates practical potential for early, interpretable clinical alerts without requiring complex time-series modeling or natural language processing.</description>

      <title>ConceptFlow: Hierarchical and Fine-grained Concept-Based Explanation for Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept-based interpretability for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) aims to align internal model representations with high-level semantic concepts, but existing approaches largely overlook the semantic roles of individual filters and the dynamic propagation of concepts across layers. To address these limitations, we propose ConceptFlow, a concept-based interpretability framework that simulates the internal "thinking path" of a model by tracing how concepts emerge and evolve across layers. ConceptFlow comprises two key components: (i) concept attentions, which associate each filter with relevant high-level concepts to enable localized semantic interpretation, and (ii) conceptual pathways, derived from a concept transition matrix that quantifies how concepts propagate and transform between filters. Together, these components offer a unified and structured view of internal model reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that ConceptFlow yields semantically meaningful insights into model reasoning, validating the effectiveness of concept attentions and conceptual pathways in explaining decision behavior. By modeling hierarchical conceptual pathways, ConceptFlow provides deeper insight into the internal logic of CNNs and supports the generation of more faithful and human-aligned explanations.</description>

      <title>Sparse Training Scheme for Multimodal LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across a variety of domains. However, training MLLMs is often inefficient due to the significantly longer input sequences introduced by multimodal data and the low utilization of inter-layer computations. To address this challenge, we shift the focus to the training process itself and propose a novel training-efficient framework based on sparse representations, termed the Sparse Training Scheme (STS). This scheme consists of two key components: the Visual Token Compressor, which reduces the information load by compressing visual tokens, and the Layer Dynamic Skipper, which mitigates the computational overhead by dynamically skipping unnecessary layers in the language model during both forward and backward passes. Our approach is broadly applicable to diverse MLLM architectures and has been extensively evaluated on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>HyperNAS: Enhancing Architecture Representation for NAS Predictor via Hypernetwork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-intensive performance evaluations significantly impede progress in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). To address this, neural predictors leverage surrogate models trained on proxy datasets, allowing for direct performance predictions for new architectures. However, these predictors often exhibit poor generalization due to their limited ability to capture intricate relationships among various architectures. In this paper, we propose HyperNAS, a novel neural predictor paradigm for enhancing architecture representation learning. HyperNAS consists of two primary components: a global encoding scheme and a shared hypernetwork. The global encoding scheme is devised to capture the comprehensive macro-structure information, while the shared hypernetwork serves as an auxiliary task to enhance the investigation of inter-architecture patterns. To ensure training stability, we further develop a dynamic adaptive multi-task loss to facilitate personalized exploration on the Pareto front. Extensive experiments across five representative search spaces, including ViTs, demonstrate the advantages of HyperNAS, particularly in few-shot scenarios. For instance, HyperNAS strikes new state-of-the-art results, with 97.60\% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 82.4\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, using at least 5.0$\times$ fewer samples.</description>

      <title>WLFM: A Well-Logs Foundation Model for Multi-Task and Cross-Well Geological Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Well-log interpretation is fundamental for subsurface characterization but remains challenged by heterogeneous tool responses, noisy signals, and limited labels. We propose WLFM, a foundation model pretrained on multi-curve logs from 1200 wells, comprising three stages: tokenization of log patches into geological tokens, self-supervised pretraining with masked-token modeling and stratigraphy-aware contrastive learning, and multi-task adaptation with few-shot fine-tuning. WLFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 0.0041 MSE in porosity estimation and 74.13\% accuracy in lithology classification, while WLFM-Finetune further improves to 0.0038 MSE and 78.10\% accuracy. Beyond predictive accuracy, WLFM exhibits emergent layer-awareness, learns a reusable geological vocabulary, and reconstructs masked curves with reasonable fidelity, though systematic offsets are observed in shallow and ultra-deep intervals. Although boundary detection is not explicitly evaluated here, clustering analyses suggest strong potential for future extension. These results establish WLFM as a scalable, interpretable, and transferable backbone for geological AI, with implications for multi-modal integration of logs, seismic, and textual data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is projected to cause up to 10 million deaths annually by 2050, underscoring the urgent need for new antibiotics. Here we present ApexAmphion, a deep-learning framework for de novo design of antibiotics that couples a 6.4-billion-parameter protein language model with reinforcement learning. The model is first fine-tuned on curated peptide data to capture antimicrobial sequence regularities, then optimised with proximal policy optimization against a composite reward that combines predictions from a learned minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) classifier with differentiable physicochemical objectives. In vitro evaluation of 100 designed peptides showed low MIC values (nanomolar range in some cases) for all candidates (100% hit rate). Moreover, 99 our of 100 compounds exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against at least two clinically relevant bacteria. The lead molecules killed bacteria primarily by potently targeting the cytoplasmic membrane. By unifying generation, scoring and multi-objective optimization with deep reinforcement learning in a single pipeline, our approach rapidly produces diverse, potent candidates, offering a scalable route to peptide antibiotics and a platform for iterative steering toward potency and developability within hours.</description>

      <title>MiniCPM-V 4.5: Cooking Efficient MLLMs via Architecture, Data, and Training Recipe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are undergoing rapid progress and represent the frontier of AI development. However, their training and inference efficiency have emerged as a core bottleneck in making MLLMs more accessible and scalable. To address the challenges, we present MiniCPM-V 4.5, an 8B parameter model designed for high efficiency and strong performance. We introduce three core improvements in model architecture, data strategy and training method: a unified 3D-Resampler model architecture for highly compact encoding over images and videos, a unified learning paradigm for document knowledge and text recognition without heavy data engineering, and a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy for proficiency in both short and long reasoning modes. Comprehensive experimental results in OpenCompass evaluation show that MiniCPM-V 4.5 surpasses widely used proprietary models such as GPT-4o-latest, and significantly larger open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL 72B. Notably, the strong performance is achieved with remarkable efficiency. For example, on the widely adopted VideoMME benchmark, MiniCPM-V 4.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance among models under 30B size, using just 46.7\% GPU memory cost and 8.7\% inference time of Qwen2.5-VL 7B.</description>

      <title>Developing Training Procedures for Piecewise-linear Spline Activation Functions in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Activation functions in neural networks are typically selected from a set of empirically validated, commonly used static functions such as ReLU, tanh, or sigmoid. However, by optimizing the shapes of a network's activation functions, we can train models that are more parameter-efficient and accurate by assigning more optimal activations to the neurons. In this paper, I present and compare 9 training methodologies to explore dual-optimization dynamics in neural networks with parameterized linear B-spline activation functions. The experiments realize up to 94% lower end model error rates in FNNs and 51% lower rates in CNNs compared to traditional ReLU-based models. These gains come at the cost of additional development and training complexity as well as end model latency.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Reproducible Hybrid Solver for a Truck-Drone VRP with Recharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study last-mile delivery with one truck and one drone under explicit battery management: the drone flies at twice the truck speed; each sortie must satisfy an endurance budget; after every delivery the drone recharges on the truck before the next launch. We introduce a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) solver that couples an ALNS-based truck tour (with 2/3-opt and Or-opt) with a small pointer/attention policy that schedules drone sorties. The policy decodes launch--serve--rendezvous triplets with hard feasibility masks for endurance and post-delivery recharge; a fast, exact timeline simulator enforces launch/recovery handling and computes the true makespan used by masked greedy/beam decoding. On Euclidean instances with $N{=}50$, $E{=}0.7$, and $R{=}0.1$, the method achieves an average makespan of \textbf{5.203}$\pm$0.093, versus \textbf{5.349}$\pm$0.038 for ALNS and \textbf{5.208}$\pm$0.124 for NN -- i.e., \textbf{2.73\%} better than ALNS on average and within \textbf{0.10\%} of NN. Per-seed, the RL scheduler never underperforms ALNS on the same instance and ties or beats NN on two of three seeds. A decomposition of the makespan shows the expected truck--wait trade-off across heuristics; the learned scheduler balances both to minimize the total completion time. We provide a config-first implementation with plotting and significance-test utilities to support replication.</description>

      <title>DSFT: Inspiring Diffusion Large Language Models to Comprehend Mathematical and Logical Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a new architecture following auto regressive models. Their denoising process offers a powerful generative advantage, but they present significant challenges in learning and understanding numerically sensitive mathematical and order-sensitive logical tasks. Current training methods, including pre-training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, focus primarily on improving general knowledge retention and reasoning abilities, but lack a comprehensive understanding of mathematical and logical patterns. We propose DSFT, a simple yet effective Diffusion SFT strategy, by adjusting the masking strategy and loss function, guiding models to understand mathematical and logical patterns. This strategy can be flexibly combined with pre-training, reinforcement learning, and other training methods. Validated on models such as LLaDA and Dream series, we prove that DSFT on small-scale data can achieve improvements of 5-10% and approximately 2% on mathematical and logical problems, respectively. This inspiring masking approach offers insights for future learning of specific patterns, which can be easily and efficiently combined with other training methods and applied to various dLLMs. Our code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DSFT-0FFB/</description>

      <title>MobiGPT: A Foundation Model for Mobile Wireless Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of mobile communication technologies, future mobile networks will offer vast services and resources for commuting, production, daily life, and entertainment. Accurate and efficient forecasting of mobile data (e.g., cell traffic, user behavior, channel quality) helps operators monitor network state changes, orchestrate wireless resources, and schedule infrastructure and users, thereby improving supply efficiency and service quality. However, current forecasting paradigms rely on customized designs with tailored models for exclusive data types. Such approaches increase complexity and deployment costs under large-scale, heterogeneous networks involving base stations, users, and channels. In this paper, we design a foundation model for mobile data forecasting, MobiGPT, with a unified structure capable of forecasting three data types: base station traffic, user app usage, and channel quality. We propose a soft-prompt learning method to help the model understand features of different data types, and introduce a temporal masking mechanism to guide the model through three forecasting tasks: short-term prediction, long-term prediction, and distribution generation, supporting diverse optimization scenarios. Evaluations on real-world datasets with over 100,000 samples show that MobiGPT achieves accurate multi-type forecasting. Compared to existing models, it improves forecasting accuracy by 27.37%, 20.08%, and 7.27%, reflecting strong generalization. Moreover, MobiGPT exhibits superior zero/few-shot performance in unseen scenarios, with over 21.51% improvement, validating its strong transferability as a foundation model.</description>

      <title>PiMoE: Token-Level Routing for Integrating High-Precision Computation and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems typically rely on high-precision numerical computation to support decisions, but current large language models (LLMs) cannot yet incorporate such computations as an intrinsic and interpretable capability with existing architectures. Mainstream multi-agent approaches can leverage external experts, but inevitably introduce communication overhead and suffer from inefficient multimodal emergent capability and limited scalability. To this end, we propose PiMoE (Physically-isolated Mixture of Experts), a training and inference architecture for integrating computation and reasoning. Instead of the workflow paradigm of tool invocation, PiMoE endogenously integrates computational capabilities into neural networks after separately training experts, a text-to-computation module, and a router. At inference, the router directs computation and reasoning at the token level, thereby enabling iterative alternation within a single chain of thought. We evaluate PiMoE on two reasoning-computation tasks against LLM finetuning and the multi-agent system approaches. Results show that the PiMoE architecture achieves not only higher accuracy than directly finetuning LLMs but also significant improvements in response latency, token usage, and GPU energy consumption compared with mainstream multi-agent approaches. PiMoE offers an efficient, interpretable, and scalable paradigm for next-generation scientific or industrial intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>FedIA: A Plug-and-Play Importance-Aware Gradient Pruning Aggregation Method for Domain-Robust Federated Graph Learning on Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) under domain skew -- as observed on platforms such as \emph{Twitch Gamers} and multilingual \emph{Wikipedia} networks -- drives client models toward incompatible representations, rendering naive aggregation both unstable and ineffective. We find that the culprit is not the weighting scheme but the \emph{noisy gradient signal}: empirical analysis of baseline methods suggests that a vast majority of gradient dimensions can be dominated by domain-specific variance. We therefore shift focus from "aggregation-first" to a \emph{projection-first} strategy that denoises client updates \emph{before} they are combined. The proposed FedIA framework realises this \underline{I}mportance-\underline{A}ware idea through a two-stage, plug-and-play pipeline: (i) a server-side top-$\rho$ mask keeps only the most informative about 5% of coordinates, and (ii) a lightweight influence-regularised momentum weight suppresses outlier clients. FedIA adds \emph{no extra uplink traffic and only negligible server memory}, making it readily deployable. On both homogeneous (Twitch Gamers) and heterogeneous (Wikipedia) graphs, it yields smoother, more stable convergence and higher final accuracy than nine strong baselines. A convergence sketch further shows that dynamic projection maintains the optimal $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{2}/\sqrt{T})$ rate.</description>

      <title>SBVR: Summation of BitVector Representation for Efficient LLM Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), numerous Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) strategies have been proposed to alleviate deployment barriers created by their enormous parameter counts. Quantization achieves compression by limiting the number of representable points in the data. Therefore, the key to achieving efficient quantization is selecting the optimal combination of representation points, or codes, for the given data. Existing PTQ solutions adopt two major approaches to this problem: Round-To-Nearest (RTN)-based methods and codebook-based methods. RTN-based methods map LLM weights onto uniformly distributed integer grids, failing to account for the Gaussian-like weight distribution of LLM weights. Codebook-based methods mitigate this issue by constructing distribution-aware codebooks; however, they suffer from random and strided memory access patterns, resulting in degraded inference speed that is exacerbated by the limited size of GPU L1 cache. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LLM quantization method, SBVR (Summation of BitVector Representation), that enables Gaussian-like code representation in a hardware-friendly manner for fast inference. SBVR maps weight values to non-uniform representation points whose distribution follows the actual distribution of LLM weights, enabling more accurate compression. Additionally, we design a custom CUDA kernel that allows matrix-vector multiplication directly in the SBVR format without decompression, thereby enabling high-performance execution of SBVR-compressed models. Our evaluations of SBVR on various models demonstrate state-of-the-art perplexity and accuracy benchmark performance while delivering a 2.21x- 3.04x end-to-end token-generation speedup over naive FP16 models in the 4-bit quantization regime.</description>

      <title>TurnBack: A Geospatial Route Cognition Benchmark for Large Language Models through Reverse Route</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans can interpret geospatial information through natural language, while the geospatial cognition capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain underexplored. Prior research in this domain has been constrained by non-quantifiable metrics, limited evaluation datasets and unclear research hierarchies. Therefore, we propose a large-scale benchmark and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the geospatial route cognition of LLMs. We create a large-scale evaluation dataset comprised of 36000 routes from 12 metropolises worldwide. Then, we introduce PathBuilder, a novel tool for converting natural language instructions into navigation routes, and vice versa, bridging the gap between geospatial information and natural language. Finally, we propose a new evaluation framework and metrics to rigorously assess 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on the task of route reversal. The benchmark reveals that LLMs exhibit limitation to reverse routes: most reverse routes neither return to the starting point nor are similar to the optimal route. Additionally, LLMs face challenges such as low robustness in route generation and high confidence for their incorrect answers.

      <title>Conversational Orientation Reasoning: Egocentric-to-Allocentric Navigation with Multimodal Chain-of-Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational agents must translate egocentric utterances (e.g., "on my right") into allocentric orientations (N/E/S/W). This challenge is particularly critical in indoor or complex facilities where GPS signals are weak and detailed maps are unavailable. While chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has advanced reasoning in language and vision tasks, its application to multimodal spatial orientation remains underexplored. We introduce Conversational Orientation Reasoning (COR), a new benchmark designed for Traditional Chinese conversational navigation projected from real-world environments, addressing egocentric-to-allocentric reasoning in non-English and ASR-transcribed scenarios. We propose a multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) framework, which integrates ASR-transcribed speech with landmark coordinates through a structured three-step reasoning process: (1) extracting spatial relations, (2) mapping coordinates to absolute directions, and (3) inferring user orientation. A curriculum learning strategy progressively builds these capabilities on Taiwan-LLM-13B-v2.0-Chat, a mid-sized model representative of resource-constrained settings. Experiments show that MCoT achieves 100% orientation accuracy on clean transcripts and 98.1% with ASR transcripts, substantially outperforming unimodal and non-structured baselines. Moreover, MCoT demonstrates robustness under noisy conversational conditions, including ASR recognition errors and multilingual code-switching. The model also maintains high accuracy in cross-domain evaluation and resilience to linguistic variation, domain shift, and referential ambiguity. These findings highlight the potential of structured MCoT spatial reasoning as a path toward interpretable and resource-efficient embodied navigation.</description>

      <title>Variational Task Vector Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task vectors capture how a model changes during fine-tuning by recording the difference between pre-trained and task-specific weights. The composition of task vectors, a key operator in task arithmetic, enables models to integrate knowledge from multiple tasks without incurring additional inference costs. In this paper, we propose variational task vector composition, where composition coefficients are taken as latent variables and estimated in a Bayesian inference framework. Unlike previous methods that operate at the task level, our framework focuses on sample-specific composition. Motivated by the observation of structural redundancy in task vectors, we introduce a Spike-and-Slab prior that promotes sparsity and preserves only the most informative components. To further address the high variance and sampling inefficiency in sparse, high-dimensional spaces, we develop a gated sampling mechanism that constructs a controllable posterior by filtering the composition coefficients based on both uncertainty and importance. This yields a more stable and interpretable variational framework by deterministically selecting reliable task components, reducing sampling variance while improving transparency and generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches across all datasets by selectively leveraging the most reliable and informative components in task vectors. These findings highlight the practical value of our approach, establishing a new standard for efficient and effective task vector composition.</description>

Abstract: The size, diversity, and quality of pretraining datasets critically determine the generalization ability of foundation models. Despite their growing importance in chemoinformatics, the effectiveness of molecular representation learning has been hindered by limitations in existing small molecule datasets. To address this gap, we present MolPILE, large-scale, diverse, and rigorously curated collection of 222 million compounds, constructed from 6 large-scale databases using an automated curation pipeline. We present a comprehensive analysis of current pretraining datasets, highlighting considerable shortcomings for training ML models, and demonstrate how retraining existing models on MolPILE yields improvements in generalization performance. This work provides a standardized resource for model training, addressing the pressing need for an ImageNet-like dataset in molecular chemistry.</description>

      <title>FastMTP: Accelerating LLM Inference with Enhanced Multi-Token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly powerful, the sequential nature of autoregressive generation creates a fundamental throughput bottleneck that limits the practical deployment. While Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has demonstrated remarkable benefits for model training efficiency and performance, its inherent potential for inference acceleration remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces FastMTP, a simple yet effective method that improves multi-step draft quality by aligning MTP training with its inference pattern, significantly enhancing speculative decoding performance. Our approach fine-tunes a single MTP head with position-shared weights on self-distilled data, enabling it to capture dependencies among consecutive future tokens and maintain high acceptance rates across multiple recursive draft steps. By integrating language-aware dynamic vocabulary compression into the MTP head, we further reduce computational overhead in the drafting process. Experimental results across seven diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FastMTP achieves an average of 2.03x speedup compared to standard next token prediction with lossless output quality, outperforming vanilla MTP by 82%. FastMTP requires only lightweight training and seamlessly integrates with existing inference frameworks, offering a practical and rapidly deployable solution for accelerating LLM inference.</description>

      <title>Multi-Worker Selection based Distributed Swarm Learning for Edge IoT with Non-i.i.d. Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in distributed swarm learning (DSL) offer a promising paradigm for edge Internet of Things. Such advancements enhance data privacy, communication efficiency, energy saving, and model scalability. However, the presence of non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data pose a significant challenge for multi-access edge computing, degrading learning performance and diverging training behavior of vanilla DSL. Further, there still lacks theoretical guidance on how data heterogeneity affects model training accuracy, which requires thorough investigation. To fill the gap, this paper first study the data heterogeneity by measuring the impact of non-i.i.d. datasets under the DSL framework. This then motivates a new multi-worker selection design for DSL, termed M-DSL algorithm, which works effectively with distributed heterogeneous data. A new non-i.i.d. degree metric is introduced and defined in this work to formulate the statistical difference among local datasets, which builds a connection between the measure of data heterogeneity and the evaluation of DSL performance. In this way, our M-DSL guides effective selection of multiple works who make prominent contributions for global model updates. We also provide theoretical analysis on the convergence behavior of our M-DSL, followed by extensive experiments on different heterogeneous datasets and non-i.i.d. data settings. Numerical results verify performance improvement and network intelligence enhancement provided by our M-DSL beyond the benchmarks.</description>

      <title>GnnXemplar: Exemplars to Explanations - Natural Language Rules for Global GNN Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used for node classification, yet their opaque decision-making limits trust and adoption. While local explanations offer insights into individual predictions, global explanation methods, those that characterize an entire class, remain underdeveloped. Existing global explainers rely on motif discovery in small graphs, an approach that breaks down in large, real-world settings where subgraph repetition is rare, node attributes are high-dimensional, and predictions arise from complex structure-attribute interactions. We propose GnnXemplar, a novel global explainer inspired from Exemplar Theory from cognitive science. GnnXemplar identifies representative nodes in the GNN embedding space, exemplars, and explains predictions using natural language rules derived from their neighborhoods. Exemplar selection is framed as a coverage maximization problem over reverse k-nearest neighbors, for which we provide an efficient greedy approximation. To derive interpretable rules, we employ a self-refining prompt strategy using large language models (LLMs). Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that GnnXemplar significantly outperforms existing methods in fidelity, scalability, and human interpretability, as validated by a user study with 60 participants.</description>

      <title>Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory anomaly detection is essential for identifying unusual and unexpected movement patterns in applications ranging from intelligent transportation systems to urban safety and fraud prevention.
  Existing methods only consider limited aspects of the trajectory nature and its movement space by treating trajectories as sequences of sampled locations, with sampling determined by positioning technology, e.g., GPS, or by high-level abstractions such as staypoints. Trajectories are analyzed in Euclidean space, neglecting the constraints and connectivity information of the underlying movement network, e.g., road or transit networks.
  The proposed Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection (GETAD) framework tightly integrates road network topology, segment semantics, and historical travel patterns to model trajectory data. GETAD uses a Graph Attention Network to learn road-aware embeddings that capture both physical attributes and transition behavior, and augments these with graph-based positional encodings that reflect the spatial layout of the road network.
  A Transformer-based decoder models sequential movement, while a multiobjective loss function combining autoregressive prediction and supervised link prediction ensures realistic and structurally coherent representations.
  To improve the robustness of anomaly detection, we introduce Confidence Weighted Negative Log Likelihood (CW NLL), an anomaly scoring function that emphasizes high-confidence deviations.
  Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GETAD achieves consistent improvements over existing methods, particularly in detecting subtle anomalies in road-constrained environments. These results highlight the benefits of incorporating graph structure and contextual semantics into trajectory modeling, enabling more precise and context-aware anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Towards Provable Emergence of In-Context Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typically, a modern reinforcement learning (RL) agent solves a task by updating its neural network parameters to adapt its policy to the task. Recently, it has been observed that some RL agents can solve a wide range of new out-of-distribution tasks without parameter updates after pretraining on some task distribution. When evaluated in a new task, instead of making parameter updates, the pretrained agent conditions its policy on additional input called the context, e.g., the agent's interaction history in the new task. The agent's performance increases as the information in the context increases, with the agent's parameters fixed. This phenomenon is typically called in-context RL (ICRL). The pretrained parameters of the agent network enable the remarkable ICRL phenomenon. However, many ICRL works perform the pretraining with standard RL algorithms. This raises the central question this paper aims to address: Why can the RL pretraining algorithm generate network parameters that enable ICRL? We hypothesize that the parameters capable of ICRL are minimizers of the pretraining loss. This work provides initial support for this hypothesis through a case study. In particular, we prove that when a Transformer is pretrained for policy evaluation, one of the global minimizers of the pretraining loss can enable in-context temporal difference learning.</description>

      <title>Development of Deep Learning Optimizers: Approaches, Concepts, and Update Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning optimizers are optimization algorithms that enable deep neural networks to learn. The effectiveness of learning is highly dependent on the optimizer employed in the training process. Alongside the rapid advancement of deep learning, a wide range of optimizers with different approaches have been developed. This study aims to provide a review of various optimizers that have been proposed and received attention in the literature. From Stochastic gradient descent to the most recent ones such as Momentum, AdamW, Sophia, and Muon in chronological order, optimizers are examined individually, and their distinctive features are highlighted in the study. The update rule of each optimizer is presented in detail, with an explanation of the associated concepts and variables. The techniques applied by these optimizers, their contributions to the optimization process, and their default hyperparameter settings are also discussed. In addition, insights are offered into the open challenges encountered in the optimization of deep learning models. Thus, a comprehensive resource is provided both for understanding the current state of optimizers and for identifying potential areas of future development.</description>

      <title>Explicit Path CGR: Maintaining Sequence Fidelity in Geometric Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel information-preserving Chaos Game Representation (CGR) method, also called Reverse-CGR (R-CGR), for biological sequence analysis that addresses the fundamental limitation of traditional CGR approaches - the loss of sequence information during geometric mapping. Our method introduces complete sequence recovery through explicit path encoding combined with rational arithmetic precision control, enabling perfect sequence reconstruction from stored geometric traces. Unlike purely geometric approaches, our reversibility is achieved through comprehensive path storage that maintains both positional and character information at each step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of R-CGR on biological sequence classification tasks, achieving competitive performance compared to traditional sequence-based methods while providing interpretable geometric visualizations. The approach generates feature-rich images suitable for deep learning while maintaining complete sequence information through explicit encoding, opening new avenues for interpretable bioinformatics analysis where both accuracy and sequence recovery are essential.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Policies with Offline and Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Promoting Physical Activity in Older Adults Using Wearable Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing offline reinforcement learning (RL) with real-world clinical data is getting increasing attention in AI for healthcare. However, implementation poses significant challenges. Defining direct rewards is difficult, and inverse RL (IRL) struggles to infer accurate reward functions from expert behavior in complex environments. Offline RL also encounters challenges in aligning learned policies with observed human behavior in healthcare applications. To address challenges in applying offline RL to physical activity promotion for older adults at high risk of falls, based on wearable sensor activity monitoring, we introduce Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and Diffusion Policies for Offline Inverse Reinforcement Learning (KANDI). By leveraging the flexible function approximation in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, we estimate reward functions by learning free-living environment behavior from low-fall-risk older adults (experts), while diffusion-based policies within an Actor-Critic framework provide a generative approach for action refinement and efficiency in offline RL. We evaluate KANDI using wearable activity monitoring data in a two-arm clinical trial from our Physio-feedback Exercise Program (PEER) study, emphasizing its practical application in a fall-risk intervention program to promote physical activity among older adults. Additionally, KANDI outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the D4RL benchmark. These results underscore KANDI's potential to address key challenges in offline RL for healthcare applications, offering an effective solution for activity promotion intervention strategies in healthcare.</description>

      <title>MeshODENet: A Graph-Informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equation Neural Network for Simulating Mesh-Based Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of complex physical systems using a discretized mesh is a cornerstone of applied mechanics, but traditional numerical solvers are often computationally prohibitive for many-query tasks. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogate models for mesh-based data, their standard autoregressive application for long-term prediction is often plagued by error accumulation and instability. To address this, we introduce MeshODENet, a general framework that synergizes the spatial reasoning of GNNs with the continuous-time modeling of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and versatility on a series of challenging structural mechanics problems, including one- and two-dimensional elastic bodies undergoing large, non-linear deformations. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline models in long-term predictive accuracy and stability, while achieving substantial computational speed-ups over traditional solvers. This work presents a powerful and generalizable approach for developing data-driven surrogates to accelerate the analysis and modeling of complex structural systems.</description>

      <title>Fast Linear Solvers via AI-Tuned Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based Matrix Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large, sparse linear systems are pervasive in modern science and engineering, and Krylov subspace solvers are an established means of solving them. Yet convergence can be slow for ill-conditioned matrices, so practical deployments usually require preconditioners. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based matrix inversion can generate such preconditioners and accelerate Krylov iterations, but its effectiveness depends on parameters whose optima vary across matrices; manual or grid search is costly. We present an AI-driven framework recommending MCMC parameters for a given linear system. A graph neural surrogate predicts preconditioning speed from $A$ and MCMC parameters. A Bayesian acquisition function then chooses the parameter sets most likely to minimise iterations. On a previously unseen ill-conditioned system, the framework achieves better preconditioning with 50\% of the search budget of conventional methods, yielding about a 10\% reduction in iterations to convergence. These results suggest a route for incorporating MCMC-based preconditioners into large-scale systems.</description>

      <title>GluMind: Multimodal Parallel Attention and Knowledge Retention for Robust Cross-Population Blood Glucose Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes GluMind, a transformer-based multimodal framework designed for continual and long-term blood glucose forecasting. GluMind devises two attention mechanisms, including cross-attention and multi-scale attention, which operate in parallel and deliver accurate predictive performance. Cross-attention effectively integrates blood glucose data with other physiological and behavioral signals such as activity, stress, and heart rate, addressing challenges associated with varying sampling rates and their adverse impacts on robust prediction. Moreover, the multi-scale attention mechanism captures long-range temporal dependencies. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, GluMind incorporates a knowledge retention technique into the transformer-based forecasting model. The knowledge retention module not only enhances the model's ability to retain prior knowledge but also boosts its overall forecasting performance. We evaluate GluMind on the recently released AIREADI dataset, which contains behavioral and physiological data collected from healthy people, individuals with prediabetes, and those with type 2 diabetes. We examine the performance stability and adaptability of GluMind in learning continuously as new patient cohorts are introduced. Experimental results show that GluMind consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art forecasting models, achieving approximately 15% and 9% improvements in root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), respectively.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Geometric Principal Component Analysis with application to neural data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is critical across various domains of science including neuroscience. Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) is a prominent dimensionality reduction method that provides a probabilistic approach unlike the deterministic approach of PCA and serves as a connection between PCA and Factor Analysis (FA). Despite their power, PPCA and its extensions are mainly based on linear models and can only describe the data in a Euclidean coordinate system. However, in many neuroscience applications, data may be distributed around a nonlinear geometry (i.e., manifold) rather than lying in the Euclidean space. We develop Probabilistic Geometric Principal Component Analysis (PGPCA) for such datasets as a new dimensionality reduction algorithm that can explicitly incorporate knowledge about a given nonlinear manifold that is first fitted from these data. Further, we show how in addition to the Euclidean coordinate system, a geometric coordinate system can be derived for the manifold to capture the deviations of data from the manifold and noise. We also derive a data-driven EM algorithm for learning the PGPCA model parameters. As such, PGPCA generalizes PPCA to better describe data distributions by incorporating a nonlinear manifold geometry. In simulations and brain data analyses, we show that PGPCA can effectively model the data distribution around various given manifolds and outperforms PPCA for such data. Moreover, PGPCA provides the capability to test whether the new geometric coordinate system better describes the data than the Euclidean one. Finally, PGPCA can perform dimensionality reduction and learn the data distribution both around and on the manifold. These capabilities make PGPCA valuable for enhancing the efficacy of dimensionality reduction for analysis of high-dimensional data that exhibit noise and are distributed around a nonlinear manifold.</description>

      <title>Discrete-time diffusion-like models for speech synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. These models view speech generation as a continuous-time process. For efficient training, this process is typically restricted to additive Gaussian noising, which is limiting. For inference, the time is typically discretized, leading to the mismatch between continuous training and discrete sampling conditions. Recently proposed discrete-time processes, on the other hand, usually do not have these limitations, may require substantially fewer inference steps, and are fully consistent between training/inference conditions. This paper explores some diffusion-like discrete-time processes and proposes some new variants. These include processes applying additive Gaussian noise, multiplicative Gaussian noise, blurring noise and a mixture of blurring and Gaussian noises. The experimental results suggest that discrete-time processes offer comparable subjective and objective speech quality to their widely popular continuous counterpart, with more efficient and consistent training and inference schemas.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding vectors are widely used for representing unstructured data and searching through it for semantically similar items. However, the large size of these vectors, due to their high-dimensionality, creates problems for modern vector search techniques: retrieving large vectors from memory/storage is expensive and their footprint is costly. In this work, we present NVQ (non-uniform vector quantization), a new vector compression technique that is computationally and spatially efficient in the high-fidelity regime. The core in NVQ is to use novel parsimonious and computationally efficient nonlinearities for building non-uniform vector quantizers. Critically, these quantizers are \emph{individually} learned for each indexed vector. Our experimental results show that NVQ exhibits improved accuracy compared to the state of the art with a minimal computational cost.</description>

      <title>SimpleFold: Folding Proteins is Simpler than You Think</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein folding models have achieved groundbreaking results typically via a combination of integrating domain knowledge into the architectural blocks and training pipelines. Nonetheless, given the success of generative models across different but related problems, it is natural to question whether these architectural designs are a necessary condition to build performant models. In this paper, we introduce SimpleFold, the first flow-matching based protein folding model that solely uses general purpose transformer blocks. Protein folding models typically employ computationally expensive modules involving triangular updates, explicit pair representations or multiple training objectives curated for this specific domain. Instead, SimpleFold employs standard transformer blocks with adaptive layers and is trained via a generative flow-matching objective with an additional structural term. We scale SimpleFold to 3B parameters and train it on approximately 9M distilled protein structures together with experimental PDB data. On standard folding benchmarks, SimpleFold-3B achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, in addition SimpleFold demonstrates strong performance in ensemble prediction which is typically difficult for models trained via deterministic reconstruction objectives. Due to its general-purpose architecture, SimpleFold shows efficiency in deployment and inference on consumer-level hardware. SimpleFold challenges the reliance on complex domain-specific architectures designs in protein folding, opening up an alternative design space for future progress.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed time series analysis with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks under Ehrenfest constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of quantum dynamical responses lies at the heart of modern physics. Yet, modeling these time-dependent behaviors remains a formidable challenge because quantum systems evolve in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, often rendering traditional numerical methods computationally prohibitive. While large language models have achieved remarkable success in sequential prediction, quantum dynamics presents a fundamentally different challenge: forecasting the entire temporal evolution of quantum systems rather than merely the next element in a sequence. Existing neural architectures such as recurrent and convolutional networks often require vast training datasets and suffer from spurious oscillations that compromise physical interpretability. In this work, we introduce a fundamentally new approach: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) augmented with physics-informed loss functions that enforce the Ehrenfest theorems. Our method achieves superior accuracy with significantly less training data: it requires only 5.4 percent of the samples (200) compared to Temporal Convolution Networks (3,700). We further introduce the Chain of KANs, a novel architecture that embeds temporal causality directly into the model design, making it particularly well-suited for time series modeling. Our results demonstrate that physics-informed KANs offer a compelling advantage over conventional black-box models, maintaining both mathematical rigor and physical consistency while dramatically reducing data requirements.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Data can Enhance the Utility of Synthetic Data for Training Anti-Money Laundering Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Money laundering is a critical global issue for financial institutions. Automated Anti-money laundering (AML) models, like Graph Neural Networks (GNN), can be trained to identify illicit transactions in real time. A major issue for developing such models is the lack of access to training data due to privacy and confidentiality concerns. Synthetically generated data that mimics the statistical properties of real data but preserves privacy and confidentiality has been proposed as a solution. However, training AML models on purely synthetic datasets presents its own set of challenges. This article proposes the use of hybrid datasets to augment the utility of synthetic datasets by incorporating publicly available, easily accessible, and real-world features. These additions demonstrate that hybrid datasets not only preserve privacy but also improve model utility, offering a practical pathway for financial institutions to enhance AML systems.</description>

      <title>APRIL: Active Partial Rollouts in Reinforcement Learning to tame long-tail generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone in advancing large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs). Successive generations, including GPT-o series, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K1.5, Grok 4, and GLM-4.5, have relied on large-scale RL training to enhance reasoning and coding capabilities. To meet the community's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. Most of these frameworks primarily rely on inference engines for rollout generation and training engines for policy updates. However, RL training remains computationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90% of total runtime. In addition, its efficiency is often constrained by the long-tail distribution of rollout response lengths, where a few lengthy responses stall entire batches, leaving GPUs idle and underutilized. As model and rollout sizes continue to grow, this bottleneck increasingly limits scalability. To address this challenge, we propose Active Partial Rollouts in Reinforcement Learning (APRIL), which mitigates long-tail inefficiency. In the rollout phase, APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, terminates once the target number of responses is reached, and recycles incomplete responses for continuation in future steps. This strategy ensures that no rollouts are discarded while substantially reducing GPU idle time. Experiments show that APRIL improves rollout throughput by at most 44% across commonly used RL algorithms (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO), accelerates convergence, and achieves at most 8% higher final accuracy across tasks. Moreover, APRIL is both framework and hardware agnostic, already integrated into the slime RL framework, and deployable on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs alike. Taken together, this work unifies system-level and algorithmic considerations in proposing APRIL, with the aim of advancing RL training efficiency and inspiring further optimizations in RL systems.</description>

Abstract: A fundamental property of DNA is that the reverse complement (RC) of a sequence often carries identical biological meaning. However, state-of-the-art DNA language models frequently fail to capture this symmetry, producing inconsistent predictions for a sequence and its RC counterpart, which undermines their reliability. In this work, we introduce Reverse-Complement Consistency Regularization (RCCR), a simple and model-agnostic fine-tuning objective that directly penalizes the divergence between a model's prediction on a sequence and the aligned prediction on its reverse complement. We evaluate RCCR across three diverse backbones (Nucleotide Transformer, HyenaDNA, DNABERT-2) on a wide range of genomic tasks, including sequence classification, scalar regression, and profile prediction. Our experiments show that RCCR substantially improves RC robustness by dramatically reducing prediction flips and errors, all while maintaining or improving task accuracy compared to baselines such as RC data augmentation and test-time averaging. By integrating a key biological prior directly into the learning process, RCCR produces a single, intrinsically robust, and computationally efficient model fine-tuning recipe for diverse biology tasks.</description>

      <title>Symphony-MoE: Harmonizing Disparate Pre-trained Models into a Coherent Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable scalable performance by activating large parameter sets sparsely, minimizing computational overhead. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of training MoEs from scratch, recent work employs upcycling, reusing a single pre-trained dense model by replicating its feed-forward network (FFN) layers into experts. However, this limits expert diversity, as all experts originate from a single pre-trained dense model. This paper addresses this limitation by constructing powerful MoE models using experts sourced from multiple identically-architected but disparate pre-trained models (e.g., Llama2-Chat and Code Llama). A key challenge lies in the fact that these source models occupy disparate, dissonant regions of the parameter space, making direct upcycling prone to severe performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose Symphony-MoE, a novel two-stage framework designed to harmonize these models into a single, coherent expert mixture. First, we establish this harmony in a training-free manner: we construct a shared backbone via a layer-aware fusion strategy and, crucially, alleviate parameter misalignment among experts using activation-based functional alignment. Subsequently, a single lightweight stage of router training coordinates the entire architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our method successfully integrates experts from heterogeneous sources, achieving an MoE model that significantly surpasses baselines in multi-domain tasks and out-of-distribution generalization.</description>

      <title>Global Minimizers of Sigmoid Contrastive Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The meta-task of obtaining and aligning representations through contrastive pretraining is steadily gaining importance since its introduction in CLIP and ALIGN. In this paper we theoretically explain the advantages of synchronizing with trainable inverse temperature and bias under the sigmoid loss, as implemented in the recent SigLIP and SigLIP2 models of Google DeepMind. Temperature and bias can drive the loss function to zero for a rich class of configurations that we call $(\mathsf{m}, \mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{rel}})$-Constellations. $(\mathsf{m}, \mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{rel}})$-Constellations are a novel combinatorial object related to spherical codes and are parametrized by a margin $\mathsf{m}$ and relative bias $\mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{rel}}$. We use our characterization of constellations to theoretically justify the success of SigLIP on retrieval, to explain the modality gap present in SigLIP, and to identify the necessary dimension for producing high-quality representations. Finally, we propose a reparameterization of the sigmoid loss with explicit relative bias, which improves training dynamics in experiments with synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Explainable Graph Neural Networks: Understanding Brain Connectivity and Biomarkers in Dementia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with multiple etiologies, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and vascular dementia. Its clinical and biological heterogeneity makes diagnosis and subtype differentiation highly challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown strong potential in modeling brain connectivity, but their limited robustness, data scarcity, and lack of interpretability constrain clinical adoption. Explainable Graph Neural Networks (XGNNs) have emerged to address these barriers by combining graph-based learning with interpretability, enabling the identification of disease-relevant biomarkers, analysis of brain network disruptions, and provision of transparent insights for clinicians. This paper presents the first comprehensive review dedicated to XGNNs in dementia research. We examine their applications across Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and multi-disease diagnosis. A taxonomy of explainability methods tailored for dementia-related tasks is introduced, alongside comparisons of existing models in clinical scenarios. We also highlight challenges such as limited generalizability, underexplored domains, and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) for early detection. By outlining both progress and open problems, this review aims to guide future work toward trustworthy, clinically meaningful, and scalable use of XGNNs in dementia research.</description>

      <title>Interaction Topological Transformer for Multiscale Learning in Porous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Porous materials exhibit vast structural diversity and support critical applications in gas storage, separations, and catalysis. However, predictive modeling remains challenging due to the multiscale nature of structure-property relationships, where performance is governed by both local chemical environments and global pore-network topology. These complexities, combined with sparse and unevenly distributed labeled data, hinder generalization across material families. We propose the Interaction Topological Transformer (ITT), a unified data-efficient framework that leverages novel interaction topology to capture materials information across multiple scales and multiple levels, including structural, elemental, atomic, and pairwise-elemental organization. ITT extracts scale-aware features that reflect both compositional and relational structure within complex porous frameworks, and integrates them through a built-in Transformer architecture that supports joint reasoning across scales. Trained using a two-stage strategy, i.e., self-supervised pretraining on 0.6 million unlabeled structures followed by supervised fine-tuning, ITT achieves state-of-the-art, accurate, and transferable predictions for adsorption, transport, and stability properties. This framework provides a principled and scalable path for learning-guided discovery in structurally and chemically diverse porous materials.</description>

      <title>DS-Diffusion: Data Style-Guided Diffusion Model for Time-Series Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are the mainstream approach for time series generation tasks. However, existing diffusion models for time series generation require retraining the entire framework to introduce specific conditional guidance. There also exists a certain degree of distributional bias between the generated data and the real data, which leads to potential model biases in downstream tasks. Additionally, the complexity of diffusion models and the latent spaces leads to an uninterpretable inference process. To address these issues, we propose the data style-guided diffusion model (DS-Diffusion). In the DS-Diffusion, a diffusion framework based on style-guided kernels is developed to avoid retraining for specific conditions. The time-information based hierarchical denoising mechanism (THD) is developed to reduce the distributional bias between the generated data and the real data. Furthermore, the generated samples can clearly indicate the data style from which they originate. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using multiple public datasets to validate our approach. Experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art model such as ImagenTime, the predictive score and the discriminative score decrease by 5.56% and 61.55%, respectively. The distributional bias between the generated data and the real data is further reduced, the inference process is also more interpretable. Moreover, by eliminating the need to retrain the diffusion model, the flexibility and adaptability of the model to specific conditions are also enhanced.</description>

      <title>Reflect before Act: Proactive Error Correction in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in interactive decision-making tasks, but existing methods often struggle with error accumulation and lack robust self-correction mechanisms. We introduce "Reflect before Act" (REBACT), a novel approach that enhances LLM-based decision-making by introducing a critical reflect step prior to taking the next action. This approach allows for immediate error correction, ensuring smooth action path and adaptibity to environment feedback. We evaluate REBACT on three diverse interactive environments: ALFWorld, WebShop, and TextCraft. Our results demonstrate that REBACT significantly outperforms strong baselines, improving success rates by up to 24% on WebShop (achieving 61%), 6.72% on ALFWorld (achieving 98.51%), and 0.5% on TextCraft (achieving 99.5%) using Claude3.5-sonnet as the underlying LLM. Further analysis reveals that REBACT's performance improvements are achieved with only a few modification steps, demonstrating its computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Flow marching for a generative PDE foundation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretraining on large-scale collections of PDE-governed spatiotemporal trajectories has recently shown promise for building generalizable models of dynamical systems. Yet most existing PDE foundation models rely on deterministic Transformer architectures, which lack generative flexibility for many science and engineering applications. We propose Flow Marching, an algorithm that bridges neural operator learning with flow matching motivated by an analysis of error accumulation in physical dynamical systems, and we build a generative PDE foundation model on top of it. By jointly sampling the noise level and the physical time step between adjacent states, the model learns a unified velocity field that transports a noisy current state toward its clean successor, reducing long-term rollout drift while enabling uncertainty-aware ensemble generations. Alongside this core algorithm, we introduce a Physics-Pretrained Variational Autoencoder (P2VAE) to embed physical states into a compact latent space, and an efficient Flow Marching Transformer (FMT) that combines a diffusion-forcing scheme with latent temporal pyramids, achieving up to 15x greater computational efficiency than full-length video diffusion models and thereby enabling large-scale pretraining at substantially reduced cost. We curate a corpus of ~2.5M trajectories across 12 distinct PDE families and train suites of P2VAEs and FMTs at multiple scales. On downstream evaluation, we benchmark on unseen Kolmogorov turbulence with few-shot adaptation, demonstrate long-term rollout stability over deterministic counterparts, and present uncertainty-stratified ensemble results, highlighting the importance of generative PDE foundation models for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>HyperAdapt: Simple High-Rank Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models excel across diverse tasks, but adapting them to specialized applications often requires fine-tuning, an approach that is memory and compute-intensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate this by updating only a small subset of weights. In this paper, we introduce HyperAdapt, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods like LoRA. Specifically, HyperAdapt adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by applying row- and column-wise scaling through diagonal matrices, thereby inducing a high-rank update while requiring only $n+m$ trainable parameters for an $n \times m$ matrix. Theoretically, we establish an upper bound on the rank of HyperAdapt's updates, and empirically, we confirm that it consistently induces high-rank transformations across model layers. Experiments on GLUE, arithmetic reasoning, and commonsense reasoning benchmarks with models up to 14B parameters demonstrate that HyperAdapt matches or nearly matches the performance of full fine-tuning and state-of-the-art PEFT methods while using orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters.</description>

      <title>Subspace Clustering of Subspaces: Unifying Canonical Correlation Analysis and Subspace Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for clustering a collection of tall matrices based on their column spaces, a problem we term Subspace Clustering of Subspaces (SCoS). Unlike traditional subspace clustering methods that assume vectorized data, our formulation directly models each data sample as a matrix and clusters them according to their underlying subspaces. We establish conceptual links to Subspace Clustering and Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (GCCA), and clarify key differences that arise in this more general setting. Our approach is based on a Block Term Decomposition (BTD) of a third-order tensor constructed from the input matrices, enabling joint estimation of cluster memberships and partially shared subspaces. We provide the first identifiability results for this formulation and propose scalable optimization algorithms tailored to large datasets. Experiments on real-world hyperspectral imaging datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior clustering accuracy and robustness, especially under high noise and interference, compared to existing subspace clustering techniques. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework in challenging high-dimensional applications where structure exists beyond individual data vectors.</description>

      <title>Towards Rational Pesticide Design with Graph Machine Learning Models for Ecotoxicology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research focuses on rational pesticide design, using graph machine learning to accelerate the development of safer, eco-friendly agrochemicals, inspired by in silico methods in drug discovery. With an emphasis on ecotoxicology, the initial contributions include the creation of ApisTox, the largest curated dataset on pesticide toxicity to honey bees. We conducted a broad evaluation of machine learning (ML) models for molecular graph classification, including molecular fingerprints, graph kernels, GNNs, and pretrained transformers. The results show that methods successful in medicinal chemistry often fail to generalize to agrochemicals, underscoring the need for domain-specific models and benchmarks. Future work will focus on developing a comprehensive benchmarking suite and designing ML models tailored to the unique challenges of pesticide discovery.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Bisimulation Metric of State Similarity between Markov Decision Processes: From Theoretical Propositions to Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bisimulation metric (BSM) is a powerful tool for computing state similarities within a Markov decision process (MDP), revealing that states closer in BSM have more similar optimal value functions. While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP scenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis of its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) between pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental properties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance bound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.</description>

      <title>LLM-Enhanced Self-Evolving Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Step E-Commerce Payment Fraud Risk Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to e-commerce payment fraud detection by integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with Large Language Models (LLMs). By framing transaction risk as a multi-step Markov Decision Process (MDP), RL optimizes risk detection across multiple payment stages. Crafting effective reward functions, essential for RL model success, typically requires significant human expertise due to the complexity and variability in design. LLMs, with their advanced reasoning and coding capabilities, are well-suited to refine these functions, offering improvements over traditional methods. Our approach leverages LLMs to iteratively enhance reward functions, achieving better fraud detection accuracy and demonstrating zero-shot capability. Experiments with real-world data confirm the effectiveness, robustness, and resilience of our LLM-enhanced RL framework through long-term evaluations, underscoring the potential of LLMs in advancing industrial RL applications.</description>

      <title>Theory of periodic convolutional neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel convolutional neural network architecture, termed the \emph{periodic CNN}, which incorporates periodic boundary conditions into the convolutional layers. Our main theoretical contribution is a rigorous approximation theorem: periodic CNNs can approximate ridge functions depending on $d-1$ linear variables in a $d$-dimensional input space, while such approximation is impossible in lower-dimensional ridge settings ($d-2$ or fewer variables). This result establishes a sharp characterization of the expressive power of periodic CNNs. Beyond the theory, our findings suggest that periodic CNNs are particularly well-suited for problems where data naturally admits a ridge-like structure of high intrinsic dimension, such as image analysis on wrapped domains, physics-informed learning, and materials science. The work thus both expands the mathematical foundation of CNN approximation theory and highlights a class of architectures with surprising and practically relevant approximation capabilities.</description>

      <title>MOMEMTO: Patch-based Memory Gate Model in Time Series Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently reconstruction-based deep models have been widely used for time series anomaly detection, but as their capacity and representation capability increase, these models tend to over-generalize, often reconstructing unseen anomalies accurately. Prior works have attempted to mitigate this by incorporating a memory architecture that stores prototypes of normal patterns. Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from high training costs and have yet to be effectively integrated with time series foundation models (TFMs). To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MOMEMTO}, a TFM for anomaly detection, enhanced with a patch-based memory module to mitigate over-generalization. The memory module is designed to capture representative normal patterns from multiple domains and enables a single model to be jointly fine-tuned across multiple datasets through a multi-domain training strategy. MOMEMTO initializes memory items with latent representations from a pre-trained encoder, organizes them into patch-level units, and updates them via an attention mechanism. We evaluate our method using 23 univariate benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MOMEMTO, as a single model, achieves higher scores on AUC and VUS metrics compared to baseline methods, and further enhances the performance of its backbone TFM, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagonal linear networks are neural networks with linear activation and diagonal weight matrices. Their theoretical interest is that their implicit regularization can be rigorously analyzed: from a small initialization, the training of diagonal linear networks converges to the linear predictor with minimal 1-norm among minimizers of the training loss. In this paper, we deepen this analysis showing that the full training trajectory of diagonal linear networks is closely related to the lasso regularization path. In this connection, the training time plays the role of an inverse regularization parameter. Both rigorous results and simulations are provided to illustrate this conclusion. Under a monotonicity assumption on the lasso regularization path, the connection is exact while in the general case, we show an approximate connection.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Machine Learning for Uncertainty-Aware Diagnosis of Industrial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks has been increasingly applied in fault diagnostics, where it uses historical data
  to capture systems behavior, bypassing the need for high-fidelity physical models.
  However, despite their competence in prediction tasks, these models often struggle with
  the evaluation of their confidence. This matter is particularly
  important in consistency-based diagnosis where decision logic is highly sensitive to false alarms.
  To address this challenge, this work presents a diagnostic framework that uses
  ensemble probabilistic machine learning to
  improve diagnostic characteristics of data driven consistency based diagnosis
  by quantifying and automating the prediction uncertainty.
  The proposed method is evaluated across several case studies using both ablation
  and comparative analyses, showing consistent improvements across a range of diagnostic metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data assimilation is widely used in many disciplines such as meteorology, oceanography, and robotics to estimate the state of a dynamical system from noisy observations. In this work, we propose a lightweight and general method to perform data assimilation using diffusion models pre-trained for emulating dynamical systems. Our method builds on particle filters, a class of data assimilation algorithms, and does not require any further training. As a guiding example throughout this work, we illustrate our methodology on GenCast, a diffusion-based model that generates global ensemble weather forecasts.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Clustering Revisited: A Relaxation of Kernel $k$-Means Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known graph-based clustering methods, including spectral clustering, symmetric non-negative matrix factorization, and doubly stochastic normalization, can be viewed as relaxations of the kernel $k$-means approach. However, we posit that these methods excessively relax their inherent low-rank, nonnegative, doubly stochastic, and orthonormal constraints to ensure numerical feasibility, potentially limiting their clustering efficacy. In this paper, guided by our theoretical analyses, we propose \textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{D}oubly stochastic clustering (\textbf{LoRD}), a model that only relaxes the orthonormal constraint to derive a probabilistic clustering results. Furthermore, we theoretically establish the equivalence between orthogonality and block diagonality under the doubly stochastic constraint. By integrating \textbf{B}lock diagonal regularization into LoRD, expressed as the maximization of the Frobenius norm, we propose \textbf{B-LoRD}, which further enhances the clustering performance. To ensure numerical solvability, we transform the non-convex doubly stochastic constraint into a linear convex constraint through the introduction of a class probability parameter. We further theoretically demonstrate the gradient Lipschitz continuity of our LoRD and B-LoRD enables the proposal of a globally convergent projected gradient descent algorithm for their optimization. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approaches. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lwl-learning/LoRD.</description>

      <title>Shared-Weights Extender and Gradient Voting for Neural Network Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expanding neural networks during training is a promising way to augment capacity without retraining larger models from scratch. However, newly added neurons often fail to adjust to a trained network and become inactive, providing no contribution to capacity growth. We propose the Shared-Weights Extender (SWE), a novel method explicitly designed to prevent inactivity of new neurons by coupling them with existing ones for smooth integration. In parallel, we introduce the Steepest Voting Distributor (SVoD), a gradient-based method for allocating neurons across layers during deep network expansion. Our extensive benchmarking on four datasets shows that our method can effectively suppress neuron inactivity and achieve better performance compared to other expanding methods and baselines.</description>

      <title>NGRPO: Negative-enhanced Group Relative Policy Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RLVR has enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various tasks. However, GRPO, a representative RLVR algorithm, suffers from a critical limitation: when all responses within a group are either entirely correct or entirely incorrect, the model fails to learn from these homogeneous responses. This is particularly problematic for homogeneously incorrect groups, where GRPO's advantage function yields a value of zero, leading to null gradients and the loss of valuable learning signals. To overcome this issue, we propose NGRPO (Negative-enhanced Group Relative Policy Optimization), an algorithm designed to convert homogeneous errors into robust learning signals. First, NGRPO introduces Advantage Calibration. This mechanism hypothesizes the existence of a virtual maximum-reward sample during advantage calculation, thereby altering the mean and variance of rewards within a group and ensuring that the advantages for homogeneously incorrect samples are no longer zero. Second, NGRPO employs Asymmetric Clipping, which relaxes the update magnitude for positive samples while imposing stricter constraints on that of negative samples. This serves to stabilize the exploration pressure introduced by the advantage calibration. Our experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-7B demonstrate that NGRPO significantly outperforms baselines such as PPO, GRPO, DAPO, and PSR-NSR on mathematical benchmarks including MATH500, AMC23, and AIME2025. These results validate NGRPO's ability to learn from homogeneous errors, leading to stable and substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning.

      <title>Exploring Heterophily in Graph-level Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While heterophily has been widely studied in node-level tasks, its impact on graph-level tasks remains unclear. We present the first analysis of heterophily in graph-level learning, combining theoretical insights with empirical validation. We first introduce a taxonomy of graph-level labeling schemes, and focus on motif-based tasks within local structure labeling, which is a popular labeling scheme. Using energy-based gradient flow analysis, we reveal a key insight: unlike frequency-dominated regimes in node-level tasks, motif detection requires mixed-frequency dynamics to remain flexible across multiple spectral components. Our theory shows that motif objectives are inherently misaligned with global frequency dominance, demanding distinct architectural considerations. Experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled heterophily and real-world molecular property prediction support our findings, showing that frequency-adaptive model outperform frequency-dominated models. This work establishes a new theoretical understanding of heterophily in graph-level learning and offers guidance for designing effective GNN architectures.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Effectiveness and Durability of Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning through Maximizing Task Distinction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning allows multiple participants to collaboratively train a central model without sharing their private data. However, this distributed nature also exposes new attack surfaces. In particular, backdoor attacks allow attackers to implant malicious behaviors into the global model while maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs. Existing attacks usually rely on fixed patterns or adversarial perturbations as triggers, which tightly couple the main and backdoor tasks. This coupling makes them vulnerable to dilution by honest updates and limits their persistence under federated defenses. In this work, we propose an approach to decouple the backdoor task from the main task by dynamically optimizing the backdoor trigger within a min-max framework. The inner layer maximizes the performance gap between poisoned and benign samples, ensuring that the contributions of benign users have minimal impact on the backdoor. The outer process injects the adaptive triggers into the local model. We evaluate our method on both computer vision and natural language tasks, and compare it with six backdoor attack methods under six defense algorithms. Experimental results show that our method achieves good attack performance and can be easily integrated into existing backdoor attack techniques.</description>

      <title>Tackling GNARLy Problems: Graph Neural Algorithmic Reasoning Reimagined through Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) is a paradigm that trains neural networks to execute classic algorithms by supervised learning. Despite its successes, important limitations remain: inability to construct valid solutions without post-processing and to reason about multiple correct ones, poor performance on combinatorial NP-hard problems, and inapplicability to problems for which strong algorithms are not yet known. To address these limitations, we reframe the problem of learning algorithm trajectories as a Markov Decision Process, which imposes structure on the solution construction procedure and unlocks the powerful tools of imitation and reinforcement learning (RL). We propose the GNARL framework, encompassing the methodology to translate problem formulations from NAR to RL and a learning architecture suitable for a wide range of graph-based problems. We achieve very high graph accuracy results on several CLRS-30 problems, performance matching or exceeding much narrower NAR approaches for NP-hard problems and, remarkably, applicability even when lacking an expert algorithm.</description>

      <title>Towards Privacy-Aware Bayesian Networks: A Credal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian networks (BN) are probabilistic graphical models that enable efficient knowledge representation and inference. These have proven effective across diverse domains, including healthcare, bioinformatics and economics. The structure and parameters of a BN can be obtained by domain experts or directly learned from available data. However, as privacy concerns escalate, it becomes increasingly critical for publicly released models to safeguard sensitive information in training data. Typically, released models do not prioritize privacy by design. In particular, tracing attacks from adversaries can combine the released BN with auxiliary data to determine whether specific individuals belong to the data from which the BN was learned. State-of-the-art protection tecniques involve introducing noise into the learned parameters. While this offers robust protection against tracing attacks, it significantly impacts the model's utility, in terms of both the significance and accuracy of the resulting inferences. Hence, high privacy may be attained at the cost of releasing a possibly ineffective model. This paper introduces credal networks (CN) as a novel solution for balancing the model's privacy and utility. After adapting the notion of tracing attacks, we demonstrate that a CN enables the masking of the learned BN, thereby reducing the probability of successful attacks. As CNs are obfuscated but not noisy versions of BNs, they can achieve meaningful inferences while safeguarding privacy. Moreover, we identify key learning information that must be concealed to prevent attackers from recovering the underlying BN. Finally, we conduct a set of numerical experiments to analyze how privacy gains can be modulated by tuning the CN hyperparameters. Our results confirm that CNs provide a principled, practical, and effective approach towards the development of privacy-aware probabilistic graphical models.</description>

      <title>Lift What You Can: Green Online Learning with Heterogeneous Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensemble methods for stream mining necessitate managing multiple models and updating them as data distributions evolve. Considering the calls for more sustainability, established methods are however not sufficiently considerate of ensemble members' computational expenses and instead overly focus on predictive capabilities. To address these challenges and enable green online learning, we propose heterogeneous online ensembles (HEROS). For every training step, HEROS chooses a subset of models from a pool of models initialized with diverse hyperparameter choices under resource constraints to train. We introduce a Markov decision process to theoretically capture the trade-offs between predictive performance and sustainability constraints. Based on this framework, we present different policies for choosing which models to train on incoming data. Most notably, we propose the novel $\zeta$-policy, which focuses on training near-optimal models at reduced costs. Using a stochastic model, we theoretically prove that our $\zeta$-policy achieves near optimal performance while using fewer resources compared to the best performing policy. In our experiments across 11 benchmark datasets, we find empiric evidence that our $\zeta$-policy is a strong contribution to the state-of-the-art, demonstrating highly accurate performance, in some cases even outperforming competitors, and simultaneously being much more resource-friendly.</description>

Abstract: This paper establishes central limit theorems for Polyak-Ruppert averaged Q-learning under asynchronous updates. We present a non-asymptotic central limit theorem, where the convergence rate in Wasserstein distance explicitly reflects the dependence on the number of iterations, state-action space size, the discount factor, and the quality of exploration. In addition, we derive a functional central limit theorem, showing that the partial-sum process converges weakly to a Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Otters: An Energy-Efficient SpikingTransformer via Optical Time-to-First-Spike Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise high energy efficiency, particularly with time-to-first-spike (TTFS) encoding, which maximizes sparsity by emitting at most one spike per neuron. However, such energy advantage is often unrealized because inference requires evaluating a temporal decay function and subsequent multiplication with the synaptic weights. This paper challenges this costly approach by repurposing a physical hardware `bug', namely, the natural signal decay in optoelectronic devices, as the core computation of TTFS. We fabricated a custom indium oxide optoelectronic synapse, showing how its natural physical decay directly implements the required temporal function. By treating the device's analog output as the fused product of the synaptic weight and temporal decay, optoelectronic synaptic TTFS (named Otters) eliminates these expensive digital operations. To use the Otters paradigm in complex architectures like the transformer, which are challenging to train directly due to the sparsity issue, we introduce a novel quantized neural network-to-SNN conversion algorithm. This complete hardware-software co-design enables our model to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy across seven GLUE benchmark datasets and demonstrates a 1.77$\times$ improvement in energy efficiency over previous leading SNNs, based on a comprehensive analysis of compute, data movement, and memory access costs using energy measurements from a commercial 22nm process. Our work thus establishes a new paradigm for energy-efficient SNNs, translating fundamental device physics directly into powerful computational primitives. All codes and data are open source.</description>

      <title>Learning From Simulators: A Theory of Simulation-Grounded Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs) are predictive models trained entirely on synthetic data from mechanistic simulations. They have achieved state-of-the-art performance in domains where real-world labels are limited or unobserved, but lack a formal underpinning.
  We present the foundational theory of simulation-grounded learning. We show that SGNNs implement amortized Bayesian inference under a simulation prior and converge to the Bayes-optimal predictor. We derive generalization bounds under model misspecification and prove that SGNNs can learn unobservable scientific quantities that empirical methods provably cannot. We also formalize a novel form of mechanistic interpretability uniquely enabled by SGNNs: by attributing predictions to the simulated mechanisms that generated them, SGNNs yield posterior-consistent, scientifically grounded explanations.
  We provide numerical experiments to validate all theoretical predictions. SGNNs recover latent parameters, remain robust under mismatch, and outperform classical tools: in a model selection task, SGNNs achieve half the error of AIC in distinguishing mechanistic dynamics. These results establish SGNNs as a principled and practical framework for scientific prediction in data-limited regimes.</description>

      <title>CR-Net: Scaling Parameter-Efficient Training with Cross-Layer Low-Rank Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank architectures have become increasingly important for efficient large language model (LLM) pre-training, providing substantial reductions in both parameter complexity and memory/computational demands. Despite these advantages, current low-rank methods face three critical shortcomings: (1) compromised model performance, (2) considerable computational overhead, and (3) limited activation memory savings. To address these limitations, we propose Cross-layer Low-Rank residual Network (CR-Net), an innovative parameter-efficient framework inspired by our discovery that inter-layer activation residuals possess low-rank properties. CR-Net implements this insight through a dual-path architecture that efficiently reconstructs layer activations by combining previous-layer outputs with their low-rank differences, thereby maintaining high-rank information with minimal parameters. We further develop a specialized activation recomputation strategy tailored for CR-Net that dramatically reduces memory requirements. Extensive pre-training experiments across model scales from 60M to 7B parameters demonstrate that CR-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art low-rank frameworks while requiring fewer computational resources and less memory.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Foundations of Representation Learning using Unlabeled Data: Statistics and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representation learning from unlabeled data has been extensively studied in statistics, data science and signal processing with a rich literature on techniques for dimension reduction, compression, multi-dimensional scaling among others. However, current deep learning models use new principles for unsupervised representation learning that cannot be easily analyzed using classical theories. For example, visual foundation models have found tremendous success using self-supervision or denoising/masked autoencoders, which effectively learn representations from massive amounts of unlabeled data. However, it remains difficult to characterize the representations learned by these models and to explain why they perform well for diverse prediction tasks or show emergent behavior. To answer these questions, one needs to combine mathematical tools from statistics and optimization. This paper provides an overview of recent theoretical advances in representation learning from unlabeled data and mentions our contributions in this direction.</description>

      <title>Fully Learnable Neural Reward Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks present significant challenges, as agents must reason over entire trajectories of state-action pairs to make optimal decisions. A common strategy to address this is through symbolic formalisms, such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) or automata, which provide a structured way to express temporally extended objectives. However, these approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as the availability of a predefined Symbol Grounding (SG) function mapping raw observations to high-level symbolic representations, or prior knowledge of the temporal task. In this work, we propose a fully learnable version of Neural Reward Machines (NRM), which can learn both the SG function and the automaton end-to-end, removing any reliance on prior knowledge. Our approach is therefore as easily applicable as classic deep RL (DRL) approaches, while being far more explainable, because of the finite and compact nature of automata. Furthermore, we show that by integrating Fully Learnable Reward Machines (FLNRM) with DRL, our method outperforms previous approaches based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).</description>

      <title>OmniBridge: Unified Multimodal Understanding, Generation, and Retrieval via Latent Space Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have led to significant progress in understanding, generation, and retrieval tasks. However, current solutions often treat these tasks in isolation or require training LLMs from scratch, resulting in high computational costs and limited generalization across modalities. In this work, we present OmniBridge, a unified and modular multimodal framework that supports vision-language understanding, generation, and retrieval within a unified architecture. OmniBridge adopts a language-centric design that reuses pretrained LLMs and introduces a lightweight bidirectional latent alignment module. To address the challenge of task interference, we propose a two-stage decoupled training strategy: supervised fine-tuning and latent space alignment for aligning LLM behavior with multimodal reasoning, and semantic-guided diffusion training to align cross-modal latent spaces via learnable query embeddings. Extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that OmniBridge achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in all three tasks. Moreover, our results highlight the effectiveness of latent space alignment for unifying multimodal modeling under a shared representation space. Code and models are released at https://github.com/xiao-xt/OmniBridge.</description>

      <title>Improving Credit Card Fraud Detection through Transformer-Enhanced GAN Oversampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of credit card fraud is an acute issue of financial security because transaction datasets are highly lopsided, with fraud cases being only a drop in the ocean. Balancing datasets using the most popular methods of traditional oversampling such as the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) generally create simplistic synthetic samples that are not readily applicable to complex fraud patterns. Recent industry advances that include Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN) and Tabular Variational Autoencoders (TVAE) have demonstrated increased efficiency in tabular synthesis, yet all these models still exhibit issues with high-dimensional dependence modelling. Now we will present our hybrid approach where we use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a Transformer encoder block to produce realistic fraudulent transactions samples. The GAN architecture allows training realistic generators adversarial, and the Transformer allows the model to learn rich feature interactions by self-attention. Such a hybrid strategy overcomes the limitations of SMOTE, CTGAN, and TVAE by producing a variety of high-quality synthetic minority classes samples. We test our algorithm on the publicly-available Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset and compare it to conventional and generative resampling strategies with a variety of classifiers, such as Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Findings indicate that our Transformer-based GAN shows substantial gains in Recall, F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), which indicates that it is effective in overcoming the severe class imbalance inherent in the task of fraud detection.</description>

      <title>Latent Danger Zone: Distilling Unified Attention for Cross-Architecture Black-box Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black-box adversarial attacks remain challenging due to limited access to model internals. Existing methods often depend on specific network architectures or require numerous queries, resulting in limited cross-architecture transferability and high query costs. To address these limitations, we propose JAD, a latent diffusion model framework for black-box adversarial attacks. JAD generates adversarial examples by leveraging a latent diffusion model guided by attention maps distilled from both a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) models. By focusing on image regions that are commonly sensitive across architectures, this approach crafts adversarial perturbations that transfer effectively between different model types. This joint attention distillation strategy enables JAD to be architecture-agnostic, achieving superior attack generalization across diverse models. Moreover, the generative nature of the diffusion framework yields high adversarial sample generation efficiency by reducing reliance on iterative queries. Experiments demonstrate that JAD offers improved attack generalization, generation efficiency, and cross-architecture transferability compared to existing methods, providing a promising and effective paradigm for black-box adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Beyond Backpropagation: Exploring Innovative Algorithms for Energy-Efficient Deep Neural Network Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising computational and energy demands of deep neural networks (DNNs), driven largely by backpropagation (BP), challenge sustainable AI development. This paper rigorously investigates three BP-free training methods: the Forward-Forward (FF), Cascaded-Forward (CaFo), and Mono-Forward (MF) algorithms, tracing their progression from foundational concepts to a demonstrably superior solution.
  A robust comparative framework was established: each algorithm was implemented on its native architecture (MLPs for FF and MF, a CNN for CaFo) and benchmarked against an equivalent BP-trained model. Hyperparameters were optimized with Optuna, and consistent early stopping criteria were applied based on validation performance, ensuring all models were optimally tuned before comparison.
  Results show that MF not only competes with but consistently surpasses BP in classification accuracy on its native MLPs. Its superior generalization stems from converging to a more favorable minimum in the validation loss landscape, challenging the assumption that global optimization is required for state-of-the-art results. Measured at the hardware level using the NVIDIA Management Library (NVML) API, MF reduces energy consumption by up to 41% and shortens training time by up to 34%, translating to a measurably smaller carbon footprint as estimated by CodeCarbon.
  Beyond this primary result, we present a hardware-level analysis that explains the efficiency gains: exposing FF's architectural inefficiencies, validating MF's computationally lean design, and challenging the assumption that all BP-free methods are inherently more memory-efficient. By documenting the evolution from FF's conceptual groundwork to MF's synthesis of accuracy and sustainability, this work offers a clear, data-driven roadmap for future energy-efficient deep learning.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference for Deep Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) enable expressive hierarchical Bayesian modeling but pose substantial challenges for posterior inference, especially over inducing variables. Denoising diffusion variational inference (DDVI) addresses this by modeling the posterior as a time-reversed diffusion from a simple Gaussian prior. However, DDVI's fixed unconditional starting distribution remains far from the complex true posterior, resulting in inefficient inference trajectories and slow convergence. In this work, we propose Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference (DBVI), a principled extension of DDVI that initiates the reverse diffusion from a learnable, data-dependent initial distribution. This initialization is parameterized via an amortized neural network and progressively adapted using gradients from the ELBO objective, reducing the posterior gap and improving sample efficiency. To enable scalable amortization, we design the network to operate on the inducing inputs, which serve as structured, low-dimensional summaries of the dataset and naturally align with the inducing variables' shape. DBVI retains the mathematical elegance of DDVI, including Girsanov-based ELBOs and reverse-time SDEs,while reinterpreting the prior via a Doob-bridged diffusion process. We derive a tractable training objective under this formulation and implement DBVI for scalable inference in large-scale DGPs. Across regression, classification, and image reconstruction tasks, DBVI consistently outperforms DDVI and other variational baselines in predictive accuracy, convergence speed, and posterior quality.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks with Similarity-Navigated Probabilistic Feature Copying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various graph-based tasks. However, they face some fundamental limitations: feature oversmoothing can cause node representations to become indistinguishable in deeper networks, they struggle to effectively manage heterogeneous relationships where connected nodes differ significantly, and they process entire feature vectors as indivisible units, which limits flexibility. We seek to address these limitations. We propose AxelGNN, a novel GNN architecture inspired by Axelrod's cultural dissemination model that addresses these limitations through a unified framework. AxelGNN incorporates similarity-gated probabilistic interactions that adaptively promote convergence or divergence based on node similarity, implements trait-level copying mechanisms for fine-grained feature aggregation at the segment level, and maintains global polarization to preserve node distinctiveness across multiple representation clusters. The model's bistable convergence dynamics naturally handle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs within a single architecture. Extensive experiments on node classification and influence estimation benchmarks demonstrate that AxelGNN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art GNN methods across diverse graph structures with varying homophily-heterophily characteristics.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Problem-Dependent Bandit Policies for Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-contextual multi-armed bandit problem in a transfer learning setting: before any pulls, the learner is given N'_k i.i.d. samples from each source distribution nu'_k, and the true target distributions nu_k lie within a known distance bound d_k(nu_k, nu'_k) &lt;= L_k. In this framework, we first derive a problem-dependent asymptotic lower bound on cumulative regret that extends the classical Lai-Robbins result to incorporate the transfer parameters (d_k, L_k, N'_k). We then propose KL-UCB-Transfer, a simple index policy that matches this new bound in the Gaussian case. Finally, we validate our approach via simulations, showing that KL-UCB-Transfer significantly outperforms the no-prior baseline when source and target distributions are sufficiently close.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the widespread use of deep learning models in safety-critical applications, ensuring that the decisions of such models are robust against adversarial exploitation is of fundamental importance. In this thesis, we discuss recent progress toward designing algorithms that exhibit desirable robustness properties. First, we discuss the problem of adversarial examples in computer vision, for which we introduce new technical results, training paradigms, and certification algorithms. Next, we consider the problem of domain generalization, wherein the task is to train neural networks to generalize from a family of training distributions to unseen test distributions. We present new algorithms that achieve state-of-the-art generalization in medical imaging, molecular identification, and image classification. Finally, we study the setting of jailbreaking large language models (LLMs), wherein an adversarial user attempts to design prompts that elicit objectionable content from an LLM. We propose new attacks and defenses, which represent the frontier of progress toward designing robust language-based agents.</description>

      <title>DRO-REBEL: Distributionally Robust Relative-Reward Regression for Fast and Efficient LLM Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has become crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent. However, existing offline RLHF approaches suffer from overoptimization, where models overfit to reward misspecification and drift from preferred behaviors observed during training. We introduce DRO-REBEL, a unified family of robust REBEL updates with type-$p$ Wasserstein, KL, and $\chi^2$ ambiguity sets. Using Fenchel duality, each update reduces to a simple relative-reward regression, preserving scalability and avoiding PPO-style clipping or auxiliary value networks. Under standard linear-reward and log-linear policy classes with a data-coverage condition, we establish $O(n^{-1/4})$ estimation bounds with tighter constants than prior DRO-DPO approaches, and recover the minimax-optimal $O(n^{-1/2})$ rate via a localized Rademacher complexity analysis. The same analysis closes the gap for Wasserstein-DPO and KL-DPO, showing both also attain optimal parametric rates. We derive practical SGD algorithms for all three divergences: gradient regularization (Wasserstein), importance weighting (KL), and a fast 1-D dual solve ($\chi^2$). Experiments on Emotion Alignment, the large-scale ArmoRM multi-objective benchmark, and HH-Alignment demonstrate strong worst-case robustness across unseen preference mixtures, model sizes, and data scales, with $\chi^2$-REBEL showing consistently strong empirical performance. A controlled radius--coverage study validates a no-free-lunch trade-off: radii shrinking faster than empirical divergence concentration rates achieve minimax-optimal parametric rates but forfeit coverage, while coverage-guaranteeing radii incur $O(n^{-1/4})$ rates.</description>

      <title>Towards Practical Multi-label Causal Discovery in High-Dimensional Event Sequences via One-Shot Graph Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding causality in event sequences where outcome labels such as diseases or system failures arise from preceding events like symptoms or error codes is critical. Yet remains an unsolved challenge across domains like healthcare or vehicle diagnostics. We introduce CARGO, a scalable multi-label causal discovery method for sparse, high-dimensional event sequences comprising of thousands of unique event types. Using two pretrained causal Transformers as domain-specific foundation models for event sequences. CARGO infers in parallel, per sequence one-shot causal graphs and aggregates them using an adaptive frequency fusion to reconstruct the global Markov boundaries of labels. This two-stage approach enables efficient probabilistic reasoning at scale while bypassing the intractable cost of full-dataset conditional independence testing. Our results on a challenging real-world automotive fault prediction dataset with over 29,100 unique event types and 474 imbalanced labels demonstrate CARGO's ability to perform structured reasoning.</description>

      <title>FedFiTS: Fitness-Selected, Slotted Client Scheduling for Trustworthy Federated Learning in Healthcare AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for privacy-preserving model training, yet deployments in sensitive domains such as healthcare face persistent challenges from non-IID data, client unreliability, and adversarial manipulation. This paper introduces FedFiTS, a trust and fairness-aware selective FL framework that advances the FedFaSt line by combining fitness-based client election with slotted aggregation. FedFiTS implements a three-phase participation strategy-free-for-all training, natural selection, and slotted team participation-augmented with dynamic client scoring, adaptive thresholding, and cohort-based scheduling to balance convergence efficiency with robustness. A theoretical convergence analysis establishes bounds for both convex and non-convex objectives under standard assumptions, while a communication-complexity analysis shows reductions relative to FedAvg and other baselines. Experiments on diverse datasets-medical imaging (X-ray pneumonia), vision benchmarks (MNIST, FMNIST), and tabular agricultural data (Crop Recommendation)-demonstrate that FedFiTS consistently outperforms FedAvg, FedRand, and FedPow in accuracy, time-to-target, and resilience to poisoning attacks. By integrating trust-aware aggregation with fairness-oriented client selection, FedFiTS advances scalable and secure FL, making it well suited for real-world healthcare and cross-domain deployments.</description>

      <title>Analysis on distribution and clustering of weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study on architecture and parameter characteristics remains the hot topic in the research of large language models. In this paper we concern with the characteristics of weight which are used to analyze the correlations and differences between models. Two kinds of vectors-standard deviation vector and clustering vector-are proposed to describe features of models. In the first case, the weights are assumed to follow normal distribution. The standard deviation values of projection matrices are normalized to form Standard-Deviation Vector, representing the distribution characteristics of models. In the second case, the singular values from each weight projection matrix are extracted and grouped by K-Means algorithm. The grouped data with the same type matrix are combined as Clustering Vector to represent the correlation characteristics of models' weights. The study reveals that these two vectors can effectively distinguish between different models and clearly show the similarities among models of the same family. Moreover, after conducting LoRA fine-tuning with different datasets and models, it is found that the distribution of weights represented by standard deviation vector is directly influenced by the dataset, but the correlations between different weights represented by clustering vector remain unaffected and maintain a high consistency with the pre-trained model.</description>

      <title>PipelineRL: Faster On-policy Reinforcement Learning for Long Sequence Generatio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly utilized to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively scaling these RL methods presents significant challenges, primarily due to the difficulty in maintaining high AI accelerator utilization without generating stale, off-policy data that harms common RL algorithms. This paper introduces PipelineRL, an approach designed to achieve a superior trade-off between hardware efficiency and data on-policyness for LLM training. PipelineRL employs concurrent asynchronous data generation and model training, distinguished by the novel in-flight weight updates. This mechanism allows the LLM generation engine to receive updated model weights with minimal interruption during the generation of token sequences, thereby maximizing both the accelerator utilization and the freshness of training data. Experiments conducted on long-form reasoning tasks using 128 H100 GPUs demonstrate that PipelineRL achieves approximately $\sim 2x$ faster learning compared to conventional RL baselines while maintaining highly on-policy training data. A scalable and modular open-source implementation of PipelineRL is also released as a key contribution.</description>

Abstract: Human mobility traces, often recorded as sequences of check-ins, provide a unique window into both short-term visiting patterns and persistent lifestyle regularities. In this work we introduce GSTM-HMU, a generative spatio-temporal framework designed to advance mobility analysis by explicitly modeling the semantic and temporal complexity of human movement. The framework consists of four key innovations. First, a Spatio-Temporal Concept Encoder (STCE) integrates geographic location, POI category semantics, and periodic temporal rhythms into unified vector representations. Second, a Cognitive Trajectory Memory (CTM) adaptively filters historical visits, emphasizing recent and behaviorally salient events in order to capture user intent more effectively. Third, a Lifestyle Concept Bank (LCB) contributes structured human preference cues, such as activity types and lifestyle patterns, to enhance interpretability and personalization. Finally, task-oriented generative heads transform the learned representations into predictions for multiple downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely used real-world datasets, including Gowalla, WeePlace, Brightkite, and FourSquare, and evaluate performance on three benchmark tasks: next-location prediction, trajectory-user identification, and time estimation. The results demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements over strong baselines, confirming the effectiveness of GSTM-HMU in extracting semantic regularities from complex mobility data. Beyond raw performance gains, our findings also suggest that generative modeling provides a promising foundation for building more robust, interpretable, and generalizable systems for human mobility intelligence.</description>

      <title>Efficient Reinforcement Learning by Reducing Forgetting with Elephant Activation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting has remained a significant challenge for efficient reinforcement learning for decades (Ring 1994, Rivest and Precup 2003). While recent works have proposed effective methods to mitigate this issue, they mainly focus on the algorithmic side. Meanwhile, we do not fully understand what architectural properties of neural networks lead to catastrophic forgetting. This study aims to fill this gap by studying the role of activation functions in the training dynamics of neural networks and their impact on catastrophic forgetting in reinforcement learning setup. Our study reveals that, besides sparse representations, the gradient sparsity of activation functions also plays an important role in reducing forgetting. Based on this insight, we propose a new class of activation functions, elephant activation functions, that can generate both sparse outputs and sparse gradients. We show that by simply replacing classical activation functions with elephant activation functions in the neural networks of value-based algorithms, we can significantly improve the resilience of neural networks to catastrophic forgetting, thus making reinforcement learning more sample-efficient and memory-efficient.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Role of Learning Rate Schedules via Functional Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling laws have played a cornerstone role in guiding the training of large language models (LLMs). However, most existing works on scaling laws primarily focus on the final-step loss, overlooking the loss dynamics during the training process and, crucially, the impact of learning rate schedule (LRS). In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by studying a teacher-student kernel regression setup trained via online stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Leveraging a novel intrinsic time viewpoint and stochastic differential equation (SDE) modeling of SGD, we introduce the Functional Scaling Law (FSL), which characterizes the evolution of population risk during the training process for general LRSs. Remarkably, the impact of the LRSs is captured through an explicit convolution-type functional term, making their effects fully tractable. To illustrate the utility of FSL, we analyze three widely used LRSs -- constant, exponential decay, and warmup-stable-decay (WSD) -- under both data-limited and compute-limited regimes. We provide theoretical justification for widely adopted empirical practices in LLMs pre-training such as (i) higher-capacity models are more data- and compute-efficient; (ii) learning rate decay can improve training efficiency; (iii) WSD-like schedules can outperform direct-decay schedules. Lastly, we explore the practical relevance of FSL as a surrogate model for fitting, predicting and optimizing the loss curves in LLM pre-training, with experiments conducted across model sizes ranging from 0.1B to 1B parameters. We hope our FSL framework can deepen the understanding of LLM pre-training dynamics and provide insights for improving large-scale model training.</description>

      <title>A Validation Strategy for Deep Learning Models: Evaluating and Enhancing Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven models, especially deep learning classifiers often demonstrate great success on clean datasets. Yet, they remain vulnerable to common data distortions such as adversarial and common corruption perturbations. These perturbations can significantly degrade performance, thereby challenging the overall reliability of the models. Traditional robustness validation typically relies on perturbed test datasets to assess and improve model performance. In our framework, however, we propose a validation approach that extracts "weak robust" samples directly from the training dataset via local robustness analysis. These samples, being the most susceptible to perturbations, serve as an early and sensitive indicator of the model's vulnerabilities. By evaluating models on these challenging training instances, we gain a more nuanced understanding of its robustness, which informs targeted performance enhancement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on models trained with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, highlighting how robustness validation guided by weak robust samples can drive meaningful improvements in model reliability under adversarial and common corruption scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is widely used in wearable health monitoring, yet large PPG foundation models remain difficult to deploy on resource-limited devices. We present PPG-Distill, a knowledge distillation framework that transfers both global and local knowledge through prediction-, feature-, and patch-level distillation. PPG-Distill incorporates morphology distillation to preserve local waveform patterns and rhythm distillation to capture inter-patch temporal structures. On heart rate estimation and atrial fibrillation detection, PPG-Distill improves student performance by up to 21.8% while achieving 7X faster inference and reducing memory usage by 19X, enabling efficient PPG analysis on wearables</description>

      <title>FedFusion: Federated Learning with Diversity- and Cluster-Aware Encoders for Robust Adaptation under Label Scarcity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning in practice must contend with heterogeneous feature spaces, severe non-IID data, and scarce labels across clients. We present FedFusion, a federated transfer-learning framework that unifies domain adaptation and frugal labelling with diversity-/cluster-aware encoders (DivEn, DivEn-mix, DivEn-c). Labelled teacher clients guide learner clients via confidence-filtered pseudo-labels and domain-adaptive transfer, while clients maintain personalised encoders tailored to local data. To preserve global coherence under heterogeneity, FedFusion employs similarity-weighted classifier coupling (with optional cluster-wise averaging), mitigating dominance by data-rich sites and improving minority-client performance. The frugal-labelling pipeline combines self-/semi-supervised pretext training with selective fine-tuning, reducing annotation demands without sharing raw data. Across tabular and imaging benchmarks under IID, non-IID, and label-scarce regimes, FedFusion consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy, robustness, and fairness while maintaining comparable communication and computation budgets. These results show that harmonising personalisation, domain adaptation, and label efficiency is an effective recipe for robust federated learning under real-world constraints.</description>

      <title>Video Killed the Energy Budget: Characterizing the Latency and Power Regimes of Open Text-to-Video Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have enabled the creation of high-fidelity, temporally coherent clips from natural language prompts. Yet these systems come with significant computational costs, and their energy demands remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present a systematic study of the latency and energy consumption of state-of-the-art open-source T2V models. We first develop a compute-bound analytical model that predicts scaling laws with respect to spatial resolution, temporal length, and denoising steps. We then validate these predictions through fine-grained experiments on WAN2.1-T2V, showing quadratic growth with spatial and temporal dimensions, and linear scaling with the number of denoising steps. Finally, we extend our analysis to six diverse T2V models, comparing their runtime and energy profiles under default settings. Our results provide both a benchmark reference and practical insights for designing and deploying more sustainable generative video systems.</description>

      <title>Study Design and Demystification of Physics Informed Neural Networks for Power Flow Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the energy transition, with increasing integration of renewable sources and cross-border electricity exchanges, power grids are encountering greater uncertainty and operational risk. Maintaining grid stability under varying conditions is a complex task, and power flow simulators are commonly used to support operators by evaluating potential actions before implementation. However, traditional physical solvers, while accurate, are often too slow for near real-time use. Machine learning models have emerged as fast surrogates, and to improve their adherence to physical laws (e.g., Kirchhoff's laws), they are often trained with embedded constraints which are also known as physics-informed or hybrid models. This paper presents an ablation study to demystify hybridization strategies, ranging from incorporating physical constraints as regularization terms or unsupervised losses, and exploring model architectures from simple multilayer perceptrons to advanced graph-based networks enabling the direct optimization of physics equations. Using our custom benchmarking pipeline for hybrid models called LIPS, we evaluate these models across four dimensions: accuracy, physical compliance, industrial readiness, and out-of-distribution generalization. The results highlight how integrating physical knowledge impacts performance across these criteria. All the implementations are reproducible and provided in the corresponding Github page.</description>

      <title>Stability and Generalization of Adversarial Diffusion Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic stability is an established tool for analyzing generalization. While adversarial training enhances model robustness, it often suffers from robust overfitting and an enlarged generalization gap. Although recent work has established the convergence of adversarial training in decentralized networks, its generalization properties remain unexplored. This work presents a stability-based generalization analysis of adversarial training under the diffusion strategy for convex losses. We derive a bound showing that the generalization error grows with both the adversarial perturbation strength and the number of training steps, a finding consistent with single-agent case but novel for decentralized settings. Numerical experiments on logistic regression validate these theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>What Characterizes Effective Reasoning? Revisiting Length, Review, and Structure of CoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) spend substantial test-time compute on long chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, but what *characterizes* an effective CoT remains unclear. While prior work reports gains from lengthening CoTs and increasing review (revisiting earlier steps) via appended *wait* tokens, recent studies suggest that shorter thinking can outperform longer traces. We therefore conduct a systematic evaluation across ten LRMs on math and scientific reasoning. Contrary to the "longer-is-better" narrative, we find that both naive CoT lengthening and increased review are associated with *lower* accuracy.
  As CoT unfolds step by step, token-level metrics can conflate verbosity with process quality. We introduce a graph view of CoT to extract structure and identify a single statistic-the *Failed-Step Fraction (FSF)*, the fraction of steps in abandoned branches-that consistently outpredicts length and review ratio for correctness across models. To probe causality, we design two interventions. First, we rank candidate CoTs by each metric at test time, where FSF yields the largest pass@1 gains; second, we edit CoTs to remove failed branches, which significantly improves accuracy, indicating that failed branches bias subsequent reasoning. Taken together, these results characterize effective CoTs as those that *fail less* and support *structure-aware* test-time scaling over indiscriminately generating long CoT.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Geometric Visual Illusions as Perceptual Inductive Biases for Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary deep learning models have achieved impressive performance in image classification by primarily leveraging statistical regularities within large datasets, but they rarely incorporate structured insights drawn directly from perceptual psychology. To explore the potential of perceptually motivated inductive biases, we propose integrating classic geometric visual illusions well-studied phenomena from human perception into standard image-classification training pipelines. Specifically, we introduce a synthetic, parametric geometric-illusion dataset and evaluate three multi-source learning strategies that combine illusion recognition tasks with ImageNet classification objectives. Our experiments reveal two key conceptual insights: (i) incorporating geometric illusions as auxiliary supervision systematically improves generalization, especially in visually challenging cases involving intricate contours and fine textures; and (ii) perceptually driven inductive biases, even when derived from synthetic stimuli traditionally considered unrelated to natural image recognition, can enhance the structural sensitivity of both CNN and transformer-based architectures. These results demonstrate a novel integration of perceptual science and machine learning and suggest new directions for embedding perceptual priors into vision model design.</description>

      <title>A Cost-Benefit Analysis of On-Premise Large Language Model Deployment: Breaking Even with Commercial LLM Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly widespread. Organizations that want to use AI for productivity now face an important decision. They can subscribe to commercial LLM services or deploy models on their own infrastructure. Cloud services from providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are attractive because they provide easy access to state-of-the-art models and are easy to scale. However, concerns about data privacy, the difficulty of switching service providers, and long-term operating costs have driven interest in local deployment of open-source models. This paper presents a cost-benefit analysis framework to help organizations determine when on-premise LLM deployment becomes economically viable compared to commercial subscription services. We consider the hardware requirements, operational expenses, and performance benchmarks of the latest open-source models, including Qwen, Llama, Mistral, and etc. Then we compare the total cost of deploying these models locally with the major cloud providers subscription fee. Our findings provide an estimated breakeven point based on usage levels and performance needs. These results give organizations a practical framework for planning their LLM strategies.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Prompt Fusion for Multi-Task and Cross-Domain Adaptation in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the generalization limitations commonly observed in large language models under multi-task and cross-domain settings. Unlike prior methods such as SPoT, which depends on fixed prompt templates, our study introduces a unified multi-task learning framework with dynamic prompt scheduling mechanism. By introducing a prompt pool and a task-aware scheduling strategy, the method dynamically combines and aligns prompts for different tasks. This enhances the model's ability to capture semantic differences across tasks. During prompt fusion, the model uses task embeddings and a gating mechanism to finely control the prompt signals. This ensures alignment between prompt content and task-specific demands. At the same time, it builds flexible sharing pathways across tasks. In addition, the proposed optimization objective centers on joint multi-task learning. It incorporates an automatic learning strategy for scheduling weights, which effectively mitigates task interference and negative transfer. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, a series of sensitivity experiments were conducted. These experiments examined the impact of prompt temperature parameters and task number variation. The results confirm the advantages of the proposed mechanism in maintaining model stability and enhancing transferability. Experimental findings show that the prompt scheduling method significantly improves performance on a range of language understanding and knowledge reasoning tasks. These results fully demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness in unified multi-task modeling and cross-domain adaptation.</description>

      <title>Energy-convergence trade off for the training of neural networks on bio-inspired hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of wearable sensors and implantable devices is shifting AI processing demands to the extreme edge, necessitating ultra-low power for continuous operation. Inspired by the brain, emerging memristive devices promise to accelerate neural network training by eliminating costly data transfers between compute and memory. Though, balancing performance and energy efficiency remains a challenge. We investigate ferroelectric synaptic devices based on HfO2/ZrO2 superlattices and feed their experimentally measured weight updates into hardware-aware neural network simulations. Across pulse widths from 20 ns to 0.2 ms, shorter pulses lower per-update energy but require more training epochs while still reducing total energy without sacrificing accuracy. Classification accuracy using plain stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is diminished compared to mixed-precision SGD. We analyze the causes and propose a ``symmetry point shifting'' technique, addressing asymmetric updates and restoring accuracy. These results highlight a trade-off among accuracy, convergence speed, and energy use, showing that short-pulse programming with tailored training significantly enhances on-chip learning efficiency.</description>

      <title>SPADE: A Large Language Model Framework for Soil Moisture Pattern Recognition and Anomaly Detection in Precision Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate interpretation of soil moisture patterns is critical for irrigation scheduling and crop management, yet existing approaches for soil moisture time-series analysis either rely on threshold-based rules or data-hungry machine learning or deep learning models that are limited in adaptability and interpretability. In this study, we introduce SPADE (Soil moisture Pattern and Anomaly DEtection), an integrated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to jointly detect irrigation patterns and anomalies in soil moisture time-series data. SPADE utilizes ChatGPT-4.1 for its advanced reasoning and instruction-following capabilities, enabling zero-shot analysis without requiring task-specific annotation or fine-tuning. By converting time-series data into a textual representation and designing domain-informed prompt templates, SPADE identifies irrigation events, estimates net irrigation gains, detects, classifies anomalies, and produces structured, interpretable reports. Experiments were conducted on real-world soil moisture sensor data from commercial and experimental farms cultivating multiple crops across the United States. Results demonstrate that SPADE outperforms the existing method in anomaly detection, achieving higher recall and F1 scores and accurately classifying anomaly types. Furthermore, SPADE achieved high precision and recall in detecting irrigation events, indicating its strong capability to capture irrigation patterns accurately. SPADE's reports provide interpretability and usability of soil moisture analytics. This study highlights the potential of LLMs as scalable, adaptable tools for precision agriculture, which is capable of integrating qualitative knowledge and data-driven reasoning to produce actionable insights for accurate soil moisture monitoring and improved irrigation scheduling from soil moisture time-series data.</description>

      <title>Pareto-optimal Tradeoffs Between Communication and Computation with Flexible Gradient Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses distributed optimization problems in non-i.i.d. scenarios, focusing on the interplay between communication and computation efficiency. To this end, we propose FlexGT, a flexible snapshot gradient tracking method with tunable numbers of local updates and neighboring communications in each round. Leveraging a unified convergence analysis framework, we prove that FlexGT achieves a linear or sublinear convergence rate depending on objective-specific properties--from (strongly) convex to nonconvex--and the above-mentioned tunable parameters. FlexGT is provably robust to the heterogeneity across nodes and attains the best-known communication and computation complexity among existing results. Moreover, we introduce an accelerated gossip-based variant, termed Acc-FlexGT, and show that with prior knowledge of the graph, it achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between communication and computation. Particularly, Acc-FlexGT achieves the optimal iteration complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( L/\epsilon +L\sigma ^2/\left( n\epsilon^2 \sqrt{1-\sqrt{\rho _W}} \right) \right) $ for the nonconvex case, matching the existing lower bound up to a logarithmic factor, and improves the existing results for the strongly convex case by a factor of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( 1/\sqrt{\epsilon} \right)$, where $\epsilon$ is the targeted accuracy, $n$ the number of nodes, $L$ the Lipschitz constant, $\rho_W$ the spectrum gap of the graph, and $\sigma$ the stochastic gradient variance. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Weight Mapping Properties of a Dual Tree Single Clock Adiabatic Capacitive Neuron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dual Tree Single Clock (DTSC) Adiabatic Capacitive Neuron (ACN) circuits offer the potential for highly energy-efficient Artificial Neural Network (ANN) computation in full custom analog IC designs. The efficient mapping of Artificial Neuron (AN) abstract weights, extracted from the software-trained ANNs, onto physical ACN capacitance values has, however, yet to be fully researched. In this paper, we explore the unexpected hidden complexities, challenges and properties of the mapping, as well as, the ramifications for IC designers in terms accuracy, design and implementation. We propose an optimal, AN to ACN methodology, that promotes smaller chip sizes and improved overall classification accuracy, necessary for successful practical deployment. Using TensorFlow and Larq software frameworks, we train three different ANN networks and map their weights into the energy-efficient DTSC ACN capacitance value domain to demonstrate 100% functional equivalency. Finally, we delve into the impact of weight quantization on ACN performance using novel metrics related to practical IC considerations, such as IC floor space and comparator decision-making efficacy.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Limited and Biased RCTs through Pseudo-Sample Matching-Based Observational Data Fusion Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the online ride-hailing pricing context, companies often conduct randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and utilize uplift models to assess the effect of discounts on customer orders, which substantially influences competitive market outcomes. However, due to the high cost of RCTs, the proportion of trial data relative to observational data is small, which only accounts for 0.65\% of total traffic in our context, resulting in significant bias when generalizing to the broader user base. Additionally, the complexity of industrial processes reduces the quality of RCT data, which is often subject to heterogeneity from potential interference and selection bias, making it difficult to correct. Moreover, existing data fusion methods are challenging to implement effectively in complex industrial settings due to the high dimensionality of features and the strict assumptions that are hard to verify with real-world data. To address these issues, we propose an empirical data fusion method called pseudo-sample matching. By generating pseudo-samples from biased, low-quality RCT data and matching them with the most similar samples from large-scale observational data, the method expands the RCT dataset while mitigating its heterogeneity. We validated the method through simulation experiments, conducted offline and online tests using real-world data. In a week-long online experiment, we achieved a 0.41\% improvement in profit, which is a considerable gain when scaled to industrial scenarios with hundreds of millions in revenue. In addition, we discuss the harm to model training, offline evaluation, and online economic benefits when the RCT data quality is not high, and emphasize the importance of improving RCT data quality in industrial scenarios. Further details of the simulation experiments can be found in the GitHub repository https://github.com/Kairong-Han/Pseudo-Matching.</description>

      <title>Tensor Train Completion from Fiberwise Observations Along a Single Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor completion is an extension of matrix completion aimed at recovering a multiway data tensor by leveraging a given subset of its entries (observations) and the pattern of observation. The low-rank assumption is key in establishing a relationship between the observed and unobserved entries of the tensor. The low-rank tensor completion problem is typically solved using numerical optimization techniques, where the rank information is used either implicitly (in the rank minimization approach) or explicitly (in the error minimization approach). Current theories concerning these techniques often study probabilistic recovery guarantees under conditions such as random uniform observations and incoherence requirements. However, if an observation pattern exhibits some low-rank structure that can be exploited, more efficient algorithms with deterministic recovery guarantees can be designed by leveraging this structure. This work shows how to use only standard linear algebra operations to compute the tensor train decomposition of a specific type of ``fiber-wise" observed tensor, where some of the fibers of a tensor (along a single specific mode) are either fully observed or entirely missing, unlike the usual entry-wise observations. From an application viewpoint, this setting is relevant when it is easier to sample or collect a multiway data tensor along a specific mode (e.g., temporal). The proposed completion method is fast and is guaranteed to work under reasonable deterministic conditions on the observation pattern. Through numerical experiments, we showcase interesting applications and use cases that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Modelling of Proton Dose with Monte Carlo Dropout Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate proton dose calculation using Monte Carlo (MC) is computationally demanding in workflows like robust optimisation, adaptive replanning, and probabilistic inference, which require repeated evaluations. To address this, we develop a neural surrogate that integrates Monte Carlo dropout to provide fast, differentiable dose predictions along with voxelwise predictive uncertainty. The method is validated through a series of experiments, starting with a one-dimensional analytic benchmark that establishes accuracy, convergence, and variance decomposition. Two-dimensional bone-water phantoms, generated using TOPAS Geant4, demonstrate the method's behavior under domain heterogeneity and beam uncertainty, while a three-dimensional water phantom confirms scalability for volumetric dose prediction. Across these settings, we separate epistemic (model) from parametric (input) contributions, showing that epistemic variance increases under distribution shift, while parametric variance dominates at material boundaries. The approach achieves significant speedups over MC while retaining uncertainty information, making it suitable for integration into robust planning, adaptive workflows, and uncertainty-aware optimisation in proton therapy.</description>

      <title>Learning Progression-Guided AI Evaluation of Scientific Models To Support Diverse Multi-Modal Understanding in NGSS Classroom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning Progressions (LPs) can help adjust instruction to individual learners needs if the LPs reflect diverse ways of thinking about a construct being measured, and if the LP-aligned assessments meaningfully measure this diversity. The process of doing science is inherently multi-modal with scientists utilizing drawings, writing and other modalities to explain phenomena. Thus, fostering deep science understanding requires supporting students in using multiple modalities when explaining phenomena. We build on a validated NGSS-aligned multi-modal LP reflecting diverse ways of modeling and explaining electrostatic phenomena and associated assessments. We focus on students modeling, an essential practice for building a deep science understanding. Supporting culturally and linguistically diverse students in building modeling skills provides them with an alternative mode of communicating their understanding, essential for equitable science assessment. Machine learning (ML) has been used to score open-ended modeling tasks (e.g., drawings), and short text-based constructed scientific explanations, both of which are time- consuming to score. We use ML to evaluate LP-aligned scientific models and the accompanying short text-based explanations reflecting multi-modal understanding of electrical interactions in high school Physical Science. We show how LP guides the design of personalized ML-driven feedback grounded in the diversity of student thinking on both assessment modes.</description>

      <title>ZERA: Zero-init Instruction Evolving Refinement Agent - From Zero Instructions to Structured Prompts via Principle-based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) improves large language model (LLM) performance by refining prompts for specific tasks. However, prior APO methods typically focus only on user prompts, rely on unstructured feedback, and require large sample sizes and long iteration cycles-making them costly and brittle. We propose ZERA (Zero-init Instruction Evolving Refinement Agent), a novel framework that jointly optimizes both system and user prompts through principled, low-overhead refinement. ZERA scores prompts using eight generalizable criteria with automatically inferred weights, and revises prompts based on these structured critiques. This enables fast convergence to high-quality prompts using minimal examples and short iteration cycles. We evaluate ZERA across five LLMs and nine diverse datasets spanning reasoning, summarization, and code generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Further ablation studies highlight the contribution of each component to more effective prompt construction. Our implementation including all prompts is publicly available at https://github.com/younatics/zera-agent.</description>

      <title>PolypSeg-GradCAM: Towards Explainable Computer-Aided Gastrointestinal Disease Detection Using U-Net Based Segmentation and Grad-CAM Visualization on the Kvasir Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, with gastrointestinal (GI) polyps serving as critical precursors according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Early and accurate segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy is essential for reducing CRC progression, yet manual delineation is labor-intensive and prone to observer variability. Deep learning methods have demonstrated strong potential for automated polyp analysis, but their limited interpretability remains a barrier to clinical adoption. In this study, we present PolypSeg-GradCAM, an explainable deep learning framework that integrates the U-Net architecture with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for transparent polyp segmentation. The model was trained and evaluated on the Kvasir-SEG dataset of 1000 annotated endoscopic images. Experimental results demonstrate robust segmentation performance, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.9257 on the test set and consistently high Dice coefficients (F-score &gt; 0.96) on training and validation sets. Grad-CAM visualizations further confirmed that predictions were guided by clinically relevant regions, enhancing transparency and trust in the model's decisions. By coupling high segmentation accuracy with interpretability, PolypSeg-GradCAM represents a step toward reliable, trustworthy AI-assisted colonoscopy and improved early colorectal cancer prevention.</description>

      <title>Self Identity Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regularization is essential in deep learning to enhance generalization and mitigate overfitting. However, conventional techniques often rely on heuristics, making them less reliable or effective across diverse settings. We propose Self Identity Mapping (SIM), a simple yet effective, data-intrinsic regularization framework that leverages an inverse mapping mechanism to enhance representation learning. By reconstructing the input from its transformed output, SIM reduces information loss during forward propagation and facilitates smoother gradient flow. To address computational inefficiencies, We instantiate SIM as $ \rho\text{SIM} $ by incorporating patch-level feature sampling and projection-based method to reconstruct latent features, effectively lowering complexity. As a model-agnostic, task-agnostic regularizer, SIM can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play module, making it applicable to different network architectures and tasks.
  We extensively evaluate $\rho\text{SIM}$ across three tasks: image classification, few-shot prompt learning, and domain generalization. Experimental results show consistent improvements over baseline methods, highlighting $\rho\text{SIM}$'s ability to enhance representation learning across various tasks. We also demonstrate that $\rho\text{SIM}$ is orthogonal to existing regularization methods, boosting their effectiveness. Moreover, our results confirm that $\rho\text{SIM}$ effectively preserves semantic information and enhances performance in dense-to-dense tasks, such as semantic segmentation and image translation, as well as in non-visual domains including audio classification and time series anomaly detection. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/XiudingCai/SIM-pytorch.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring ground displacement is crucial for urban infrastructure stability and mitigating geological hazards. However, forecasting future deformation from sparse Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series data remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework that transforms these sparse point measurements into a dense spatio-temporal tensor. This methodological shift allows, for the first time, the direct application of advanced computer vision architectures to this forecasting problem. We design and implement a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network and Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model, specifically engineered to simultaneously learn spatial patterns and temporal dependencies from the generated data tensor. The model's performance is benchmarked against powerful machine learning baselines, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and LASSO regression, using Sentinel-1 data from eastern Ireland. Results demonstrate that the proposed architecture provides significantly more accurate and spatially coherent forecasts, establishing a new performance benchmark for this task. Furthermore, an interpretability analysis reveals that baseline models often default to simplistic persistence patterns, highlighting the necessity of our integrated spatio-temporal approach to capture the complex dynamics of ground deformation. Our findings confirm the efficacy and potential of spatio-temporal deep learning for high-resolution deformation forecasting.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Generating Artificial Datasets to Validate Absolute and Relative Position Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the Scrapbook framework, a novel methodology designed to generate extensive datasets for probing the learned concepts of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The framework focuses on fundamental concepts such as object recognition, absolute and relative positions, and attribute identification. By generating datasets with a large number of questions about individual concepts and a wide linguistic variation, the Scrapbook framework aims to validate the model's understanding of these basic elements before tackling more complex tasks. Our experimental findings reveal that, while contemporary models demonstrate proficiency in recognizing and enumerating objects, they encounter challenges in comprehending positional information and addressing inquiries with additional constraints. Specifically, the MobileVLM-V2 model showed significant answer disagreements and plausible wrong answers, while other models exhibited a bias toward affirmative answers and struggled with questions involving geometric shapes and positional information, indicating areas for improvement in understanding and consistency. The proposed framework offers a valuable instrument for generating diverse and comprehensive datasets, which can be utilized to systematically assess and enhance the performance of AI models.</description>

      <title>Foam-Agent: An End-to-End Composable Multi-Agent Framework for Automating CFD Simulation in OpenFOAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an essential simulation tool in engineering, yet its steep learning curve and complex manual setup create significant barriers. To address these challenges, we introduce Foam-Agent, a multi-agent framework that automates the entire end-to-end OpenFOAM workflow from a single natural language prompt. Our key innovations address critical gaps in existing systems: 1. An Comprehensive End-to-End Simulation Automation: Foam-Agent is the first system to manage the full simulation pipeline, including advanced pre-processing with a versatile Meshing Agent capable of handling external mesh files and generating new geometries via Gmsh, automatic generation of HPC submission scripts, and post-simulation visualization via ParaView. 2. Composable Service Architecture: Going beyond a monolithic agent, the framework uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose its core functions as discrete, callable tools. This allows for flexible integration and use by other agentic systems, such as Claude-code, for more exploratory workflows. 3. High-Fidelity Configuration Generation: We achieve superior accuracy through a Hierarchical Multi-Index RAG for precise context retrieval and a dependency-aware generation process that ensures configuration consistency. Evaluated on a benchmark of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 88.2% success rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing frameworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM). Foam-Agent dramatically lowers the expertise barrier for CFD, demonstrating how specialized multi-agent systems can democratize complex scientific computing. The code is public at https://github.com/csml-rpi/Foam-Agent.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting Actions (SAPA): Behavioral Theory-Guided LLMs for Ridesourcing Mode Choice Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of ridesourcing mode choices is essential for designing and implementing effective traffic management policies for reducing congestion, improving mobility, and allocating resources more efficiently. Existing models for predicting ridesourcing mode choices often suffer from limited predictive accuracy due to their inability to capture key psychological factors, and are further challenged by severe class imbalance, as ridesourcing trips comprise only a small fraction of individuals' daily travel. To address these limitations, this paper introduces the Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting Actions (SAPA) framework, a hierarchical approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize theory-grounded latent attitudes to predict ridesourcing choices. SAPA first uses an LLM to generate qualitative traveler personas from raw travel survey data and then trains a propensity-score model on demographic and behavioral features, enriched by those personas, to produce an individual-level score. Next, the LLM assigns quantitative scores to theory-driven latent variables (e.g., time and cost sensitivity), and a final classifier integrates the propensity score, latent-variable scores (with their interaction terms), and observable trip attributes to predict ridesourcing mode choice. Experiments on a large-scale, multi-year travel survey show that SAPA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving ridesourcing choice predictions by up to 75.9% in terms of PR-AUC on a held-out test set. This study provides a powerful tool for accurately predicting ridesourcing mode choices, and provides a methodology that is readily transferable to various applications.</description>

Abstract: Detailed structural building information is used to estimate potential damage from hazard events like cyclones, floods, and landslides, making them critical for urban resilience planning and disaster risk reduction. However, such information is often unavailable in many small island developing states (SIDS) in climate-vulnerable regions like the Caribbean. To address this data gap, we present an AI-driven workflow to automatically infer rooftop attributes from high-resolution satellite imagery, with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as our case study. Here, we compare the utility of geospatial foundation models combined with shallow classifiers against fine-tuned deep learning models for rooftop classification. Furthermore, we assess the impact of incorporating additional training data from neighboring SIDS to improve model performance. Our best models achieve F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.83 for roof pitch and roof material classification, respectively. Combined with local capacity building, our work aims to provide SIDS with novel capabilities to harness AI and Earth Observation (EO) data to enable more efficient, evidence-based urban governance.</description>

      <title>Joint Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Localization in WSNs with Distributed Scaled Proximal ADMM Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative and non-cooperative localization frequently arise together in wireless sensor networks, particularly when sensor positions are uncertain and targets are unable to communicate with the network. While joint processing can eliminate the delay in target estimation found in sequential approaches, it introduces complex variable coupling, posing challenges in both modeling and optimization. This paper presents a joint modeling approach that formulates cooperative and non-cooperative localization as a single optimization problem. To address the resulting coupling, we introduce auxiliary variables that enable structural decoupling and distributed computation. Building on this formulation, we develop the Scaled Proximal Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Joint Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Localization (SP-ADMM-JCNL). Leveraging the problem's structured design, we provide theoretical guarantees that the algorithm generates a sequence converging globally to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the reformulated problem and further to a critical point of the original non-convex objective function, with a sublinear rate of O(1/T). Experiments on both synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate that SP-ADMM-JCNL achieves accurate and reliable localization performance.</description>

      <title>nDNA -- the Semantic Helix of Artificial Cognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI foundation models grow in capability, a deeper question emerges: What shapes their internal cognitive identity -- beyond fluency and output? Benchmarks measure behavior, but the soul of a model resides in its latent geometry. In this work, we propose Neural DNA (nDNA) as a semantic-genotypic representation that captures this latent identity through the intrinsic geometry of belief. At its core, nDNA is synthesized from three principled and indispensable dimensions of latent geometry: spectral curvature, which reveals the curvature of conceptual flow across layers; thermodynamic length, which quantifies the semantic effort required to traverse representational transitions through layers; and belief vector field, which delineates the semantic torsion fields that guide a model's belief directional orientations. Like biological DNA, it encodes ancestry, mutation, and semantic inheritance, found in finetuning and alignment scars, cultural imprints, and architectural drift. In naming it, we open a new field: Neural Genomics, where models are not just tools, but digital semantic organisms with traceable inner cognition.
  Modeling statement. We read AI foundation models as semantic fluid--dynamics: meaning is transported through layers like fluid in a shaped conduit; nDNA is the physics-grade readout of that flow -- a geometry-first measure of how meaning is bent, paid for, and pushed -- yielding a stable, coordinate-free neural DNA fingerprint tied to on-input behavior; with this fingerprint we cross into biology: tracing lineages across pretraining, fine-tuning, alignment, pruning, distillation, and merges; measuring inheritance between checkpoints; detecting drift as traits shift under new data or objectives; and, ultimately, studying the evolution of artificial cognition to compare models, diagnose risks, and govern change over time.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Health Risk Prediction System for Chronic Diseases via Vision-Language Fusion and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rising global burden of chronic diseases and the multimodal and heterogeneous clinical data (medical imaging, free-text recordings, wearable sensor streams, etc.), there is an urgent need for a unified multimodal AI framework that can proactively predict individual health risks. We propose VL-RiskFormer, a hierarchical stacked visual-language multimodal Transformer with a large language model (LLM) inference head embedded in its top layer. The system builds on the dual-stream architecture of existing visual-linguistic models (e.g., PaLM-E, LLaVA) with four key innovations: (i) pre-training with cross-modal comparison and fine-grained alignment of radiological images, fundus maps, and wearable device photos with corresponding clinical narratives using momentum update encoders and debiased InfoNCE losses; (ii) a time fusion block that integrates irregular visit sequences into the causal Transformer decoder through adaptive time interval position coding; (iii) a disease ontology map adapter that injects ICD-10 codes into visual and textual channels in layers and infers comorbid patterns with the help of a graph attention mechanism. On the MIMIC-IV longitudinal cohort, VL-RiskFormer achieved an average AUROC of 0.90 with an expected calibration error of 2.7 percent.</description>

      <title>Towards General Computer Control with Hierarchical Agents and Multi-Level Action Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling desktop applications via software remains a fundamental yet under-served problem. Existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) ingest screenshots and task instructions to generate keystrokes and mouse events, but they suffer from prohibitive inference latency, poor sample efficiency on long-horizon sparse-reward tasks, and infeasible on-device deployment. We introduce a lightweight hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, ComputerAgent, that formulates OS control as a two-level option process (manager and subpolicy), employs a triple-modal state encoder (screenshot, task ID, numeric state) to handle visual and contextual diversity, integrates meta-actions with an early-stop mechanism to reduce wasted interactions, and uses a compact vision backbone plus small policy networks for on-device inference (15M parameters). On a suite of 135 real-world desktop tasks, ComputerAgent attains 92.1% success on simple tasks (&lt;8 steps) and 58.8% on hard tasks (&gt;=8 steps), matching or exceeding 200B-parameter MLLM baselines on simple scenarios while reducing model size by over four orders of magnitude and halving inference time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical RL offers a practical, scalable alternative to monolithic MLLM-based automation for computer control.</description>

      <title>The Illusion of Readiness: Stress Testing Large Frontier Models on Multimodal Medical Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large frontier models like GPT-5 now achieve top scores on medical benchmarks. But our stress tests tell a different story. Leading systems often guess correctly even when key inputs like images are removed, flip answers under trivial prompt changes, and fabricate convincing yet flawed reasoning. These aren't glitches; they expose how today's benchmarks reward test-taking tricks over medical understanding. We evaluate six flagship models across six widely used benchmarks and find that high leaderboard scores hide brittleness and shortcut learning. Through clinician-guided rubric evaluation, we show that benchmarks vary widely in what they truly measure yet are treated interchangeably, masking failure modes. We caution that medical benchmark scores do not directly reflect real-world readiness. If we want AI to earn trust in healthcare, we must demand more than leaderboard wins and must hold systems accountable for robustness, sound reasoning, and alignment with real medical demands.</description>

      <title>PEEK: Guiding and Minimal Image Representations for Zero-Shot Generalization of Robot Manipulation Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies often fail to generalize because they must simultaneously learn where to attend, what actions to take, and how to execute them. We argue that high-level reasoning about where and what can be offloaded to vision-language models (VLMs), leaving policies to specialize in how to act. We present PEEK (Policy-agnostic Extraction of Essential Keypoints), which fine-tunes VLMs to predict a unified point-based intermediate representation: 1. end-effector paths specifying what actions to take, and 2. task-relevant masks indicating where to focus. These annotations are directly overlaid onto robot observations, making the representation policy-agnostic and transferable across architectures. To enable scalable training, we introduce an automatic annotation pipeline, generating labeled data across 20+ robot datasets spanning 9 embodiments. In real-world evaluations, PEEK consistently boosts zero-shot generalization, including a 41.4x real-world improvement for a 3D policy trained only in simulation, and 2-3.5x gains for both large VLAs and small manipulation policies. By letting VLMs absorb semantic and visual complexity, PEEK equips manipulation policies with the minimal cues they need--where, what, and how. Website at https://peek-robot.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Improving Handshape Representations for Sign Language Processing: A Graph Neural Network Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Handshapes serve a fundamental phonological role in signed languages, with American Sign Language employing approximately 50 distinct shapes. However,computational approaches rarely model handshapes explicitly, limiting both recognition accuracy and linguistic analysis.We introduce a novel graph neural network that separates temporal dynamics from static handshape configurations. Our approach combines anatomically-informed graph structures with contrastive learning to address key challenges in handshape recognition, including subtle interclass distinctions and temporal variations. We establish the first benchmark for structured handshape recognition in signing sequences, achieving 46% accuracy across 37 handshape classes (with baseline methods achieving 25%).</description>

      <title>On Multi-entity, Multivariate Quickest Change Point Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for online Change Point Detection (CPD) from multi-entity, multivariate time series data, motivated by applications in crowd monitoring where traditional sensing methods (e.g., video surveillance) may be infeasible. Our approach addresses the challenge of detecting system-wide behavioral shifts in complex, dynamic environments where the number and behavior of individual entities may be uncertain or evolve. We introduce the concept of Individual Deviation from Normality (IDfN), computed via a reconstruction-error-based autoencoder trained on normal behavior. We aggregate these individual deviations using mean, variance, and Kernel Density Estimates (KDE) to yield a System-Wide Anomaly Score (SWAS). To detect persistent or abrupt changes, we apply statistical deviation metrics and the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) technique to these scores. Our unsupervised approach eliminates the need for labeled data or feature extraction, enabling real-time operation on streaming input. Evaluations on both synthetic datasets and crowd simulations, explicitly designed for anomaly detection in group behaviors, demonstrate that our method accurately detects significant system-level changes, offering a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for monitoring complex multi-agent systems. In addition to this methodological contribution, we introduce new, challenging multi-entity multivariate time series datasets generated from crowd simulations in Unity and coupled nonlinear oscillators. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no publicly available dataset of this type designed explicitly to evaluate CPD in complex collective and interactive systems, highlighting an essential gap that our work addresses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meta-learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for leveraging information across related tasks to improve predictive performance on new tasks. In this paper, we propose a statistical framework for analyzing meta-learning through the lens of predictor subspace characterization and quantification of task diversity. Specifically, we model the shared structure across tasks using a latent subspace and introduce a measure of diversity that captures heterogeneity across task-specific predictors. We provide both simulation-based and theoretical evidence indicating that achieving the desired prediction accuracy in meta-learning depends on the proportion of predictor variance aligned with the shared subspace, as well as on the accuracy of subspace estimation.</description>

      <title>A Single Image Is All You Need: Zero-Shot Anomaly Localization Without Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in images is typically addressed by learning from collections of training data or relying on reference samples. In many real-world scenarios, however, such training data may be unavailable, and only the test image itself is provided. We address this zero-shot setting by proposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the inductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior (DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key assumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns, and that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or stochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based training framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for self-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in DIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking, patch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual loss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel fidelity. Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references, and remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels. SSDnet achieves 0.99 AUROC and 0.60 AUPRC on MVTec-AD and 0.98 AUROC and 0.67 AUPRC on the fabric dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code will be released at https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/SSDnet</description>

      <title>G\"odel Test: Can Large Language Models Solve Easy Conjectures?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent announcements from frontier AI model labs have highlighted strong results on high-school and undergraduate math competitions. Yet it remains unclear whether large language models can solve new, simple conjectures in more advanced areas of mathematics. We propose the G\"odel Test: evaluating whether a model can produce correct proofs for very simple, previously unsolved conjectures. To this end, we study the performance of GPT-5 on five conjectures in combinatorial optimization. For each problem, we provided one or two source papers from which the conjecture arose, withheld our own conjecture, and then assessed the model's reasoning in detail. On the three easier problems, GPT-5 produced nearly correct solutions; for Problem 2 it even derived a different approximation guarantee that, upon checking, refuted our conjecture while providing a valid solution. The model failed on Problem 4, which required combining results from two papers. On Problem 5, a harder case without a validated conjecture, GPT-5 proposed the same algorithm we had in mind but failed in the analysis, suggesting the proof is more challenging than expected. Although our sample is small, the results point to meaningful progress on routine reasoning, occasional flashes of originality, and clear limitations when cross-paper synthesis is required. GPT-5 may represent an early step toward frontier models eventually passing the G\"odel Test.</description>

      <title>Measurement Score-Based MRI Reconstruction with Automatic Coil Sensitivity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based inverse problem solvers (DIS) have recently shown outstanding performance in compressed-sensing parallel MRI reconstruction by combining diffusion priors with physical measurement models. However, they typically rely on pre-calibrated coil sensitivity maps (CSMs) and ground truth images, making them often impractical: CSMs are difficult to estimate accurately under heavy undersampling and ground-truth images are often unavailable. We propose Calibration-free Measurement Score-based diffusion Model (C-MSM), a new method that eliminates these dependencies by jointly performing automatic CSM estimation and self-supervised learning of measurement scores directly from k-space data. C-MSM reconstructs images by approximating the full posterior distribution through stochastic sampling over partial measurement posterior scores, while simultaneously estimating CSMs. Experiments on the multi-coil brain fastMRI dataset show that C-MSM achieves reconstruction performance close to DIS with clean diffusion priors -- even without access to clean training data and pre-calibrated CSMs.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Transferable Solution Method for Parametric Optimal Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a transferable solution method for optimal control problems with varying objectives using function encoder (FE) policies. Traditional optimization-based approaches must be re-solved whenever objectives change, resulting in prohibitive computational costs for applications requiring frequent evaluation and adaptation. The proposed method learns a reusable set of neural basis functions that spans the control policy space, enabling efficient zero-shot adaptation to new tasks through either projection from data or direct mapping from problem specifications. The key idea is an offline-online decomposition: basis functions are learned once during offline imitation learning, while online adaptation requires only lightweight coefficient estimation. Numerical experiments across diverse dynamics, dimensions, and cost structures show our method delivers near-optimal performance with minimal overhead when generalizing across tasks, enabling semi-global feedback policies suitable for real-time deployment.</description>

      <title>Identifying birdsong syllables without labelled data</title>

Abstract: Identifying sequences of syllables within birdsongs is key to tackling a wide array of challenges, including bird individual identification and better understanding of animal communication and sensory-motor learning. Recently, machine learning approaches have demonstrated great potential to alleviate the need for experts to label long audio recordings by hand. However, they still typically rely on the availability of labelled data for model training, restricting applicability to a few species and datasets. In this work, we build the first fully unsupervised algorithm to decompose birdsong recordings into sequences of syllables. We first detect syllable events, then cluster them to extract templates --syllable representations-- before performing matching pursuit to decompose the recording as a sequence of syllables. We evaluate our automatic annotations against human labels on a dataset of Bengalese finch songs and find that our unsupervised method achieves high performance. We also demonstrate that our approach can distinguish individual birds within a species through their unique vocal signatures, for both Bengalese finches and another species, the great tit.</description>

      <title>VoxGuard: Evaluating User and Attribute Privacy in Speech via Membership Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice anonymization aims to conceal speaker identity and attributes while preserving intelligibility, but current evaluations rely almost exclusively on Equal Error Rate (EER) that obscures whether adversaries can mount high-precision attacks. We argue that privacy should instead be evaluated in the low false-positive rate (FPR) regime, where even a small number of successful identifications constitutes a meaningful breach. To this end, we introduce VoxGuard, a framework grounded in differential privacy and membership inference that formalizes two complementary notions: User Privacy, preventing speaker re-identification, and Attribute Privacy, protecting sensitive traits such as gender and accent. Across synthetic and real datasets, we find that informed adversaries, especially those using fine-tuned models and max-similarity scoring, achieve orders-of-magnitude stronger attacks at low-FPR despite similar EER. For attributes, we show that simple transparent attacks recover gender and accent with near-perfect accuracy even after anonymization. Our results demonstrate that EER substantially underestimates leakage, highlighting the need for low-FPR evaluation, and recommend VoxGuard as a benchmark for evaluating privacy leakage.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale, Longitudinal Study of Large Language Models During the 2024 US Election Season</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2024 US presidential election is the first major contest to occur in the US since the popularization of large language models (LLMs). Building on lessons from earlier shifts in media (most notably social media's well studied role in targeted messaging and political polarization) this moment raises urgent questions about how LLMs may shape the information ecosystem and influence political discourse. While platforms have announced some election safeguards, how well they work in practice remains unclear. Against this backdrop, we conduct a large-scale, longitudinal study of 12 models, queried using a structured survey with over 12,000 questions on a near-daily cadence from July through November 2024. Our design systematically varies content and format, resulting in a rich dataset that enables analyses of the models' behavior over time (e.g., across model updates), sensitivity to steering, responsiveness to instructions, and election-related knowledge and "beliefs." In the latter half of our work, we perform four analyses of the dataset that (i) study the longitudinal variation of model behavior during election season, (ii) illustrate the sensitivity of election-related responses to demographic steering, (iii) interrogate the models' beliefs about candidates' attributes, and (iv) reveal the models' implicit predictions of the election outcome. To facilitate future evaluations of LLMs in electoral contexts, we detail our methodology, from question generation to the querying pipeline and third-party tooling. We also publicly release our dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/sarahcen/llm-election-data-2024</description>

      <title>CogniLoad: A Synthetic Natural Language Reasoning Benchmark With Tunable Length, Intrinsic Difficulty, and Distractor Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current benchmarks for long-context reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) often blur critical factors like intrinsic task complexity, distractor interference, and task length. To enable more precise failure analysis, we introduce CogniLoad, a novel synthetic benchmark grounded in Cognitive Load Theory (CLT). CogniLoad generates natural-language logic puzzles with independently tunable parameters that reflect CLT's core dimensions: intrinsic difficulty ($d$) controls intrinsic load; distractor-to-signal ratio ($\rho$) regulates extraneous load; and task length ($N$) serves as an operational proxy for conditions demanding germane load. Evaluating 22 SotA reasoning LLMs, CogniLoad reveals distinct performance sensitivities, identifying task length as a dominant constraint and uncovering varied tolerances to intrinsic complexity and U-shaped responses to distractor ratios. By offering systematic, factorial control over these cognitive load dimensions, CogniLoad provides a reproducible, scalable, and diagnostically rich tool for dissecting LLM reasoning limitations and guiding future model development.</description>

      <title>Robotic Skill Diversification via Active Mutation of Reward Functions in Reinforcement Learning During a Liquid Pouring Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores how deliberate mutations of reward function in reinforcement learning can produce diversified skill variations in robotic manipulation tasks, examined with a liquid pouring use case. To this end, we developed a new reward function mutation framework that is based on applying Gaussian noise to the weights of the different terms in the reward function. Inspired by the cost-benefit tradeoff model from human motor control, we designed the reward function with the following key terms: accuracy, time, and effort. The study was performed in a simulation environment created in NVIDIA Isaac Sim, and the setup included Franka Emika Panda robotic arm holding a glass with a liquid that needed to be poured into a container. The reinforcement learning algorithm was based on Proximal Policy Optimization. We systematically explored how different configurations of mutated weights in the rewards function would affect the learned policy. The resulting policies exhibit a wide range of behaviours: from variations in execution of the originally intended pouring task to novel skills useful for unexpected tasks, such as container rim cleaning, liquid mixing, and watering. This approach offers promising directions for robotic systems to perform diversified learning of specific tasks, while also potentially deriving meaningful skills for future tasks.</description>

      <title>End-Cut Preference in Survival Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The end-cut preference (ECP) problem, referring to the tendency to favor split points near the boundaries of a feature's range, is a well-known issue in CART (Breiman et al., 1984). ECP may induce highly imbalanced and biased splits, obscure weak signals, and lead to tree structures that are both unstable and difficult to interpret. For survival trees, we show that ECP also arises when using greedy search to select the optimal cutoff point by maximizing the log-rank test statistic. To address this issue, we propose a smooth sigmoid surrogate (SSS) approach, in which the hard-threshold indicator function is replaced by a smooth sigmoid function. We further demonstrate, both theoretically and through numerical illustrations, that SSS provides an effective remedy for mitigating or avoiding ECP.</description>

      <title>Estimating Heterogeneous Causal Effect on Networks via Orthogonal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects on networks is important for both scientific research and practical applications. Unlike traditional settings that assume the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), interference allows an intervention/treatment on one unit to affect the outcomes of others. Understanding both direct and spillover effects is critical in fields such as epidemiology, political science, and economics. Causal inference on networks faces two main challenges. First, causal effects are typically heterogeneous, varying with unit features and local network structure. Second, connected units often exhibit dependence due to network homophily, creating confounding between structural correlations and causal effects. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method to estimate heterogeneous direct and spillover effects on networks. The first stage uses graph neural networks to estimate nuisance components that depend on the complex network topology. In the second stage, we adjust for network confounding using these estimates and infer causal effects through a novel attention-based interference model. Our approach balances expressiveness and interpretability, enabling downstream tasks such as identifying influential neighborhoods and recovering the sign of spillover effects. We integrate the two stages using Neyman orthogonalization and cross-fitting, which ensures that errors from nuisance estimation contribute only at higher order. As a result, our causal effect estimates are robust to bias and misspecification in modeling causal effects under network dependencies.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Coarse-to-Fine Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of machine learning, hyperbolic space demonstrates superior representation capabilities for hierarchical data compared to conventional Euclidean space. This work focuses on the Coarse-To-Fine Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (C2FSCIL) task. Our study follows the Knowe approach, which contrastively learns coarse class labels and subsequently normalizes and freezes the classifier weights of learned fine classes in the embedding space. To better interpret the "coarse-to-fine" paradigm, we propose embedding the feature extractor into hyperbolic space. Specifically, we employ the Poincar\'e ball model of hyperbolic space, enabling the feature extractor to transform input images into feature vectors within the Poincar\'e ball instead of Euclidean space. We further introduce hyperbolic contrastive loss and hyperbolic fully-connected layers to facilitate model optimization and classification in hyperbolic space. Additionally, to enhance performance under few-shot conditions, we implement maximum entropy distribution in hyperbolic space to estimate the probability distribution of fine-class feature vectors. This allows generation of augmented features from the distribution to mitigate overfitting during training with limited samples. Experiments on C2FSCIL benchmarks show that our method effectively improves both coarse and fine class accuracies.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Modeling of Behaviorally Relevant Spatiotemporal Patterns in Neural Imaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional imaging of neural activity, such as widefield calcium and functional ultrasound imaging, provide a rich source of information for understanding the relationship between brain activity and behavior. Accurately modeling neural dynamics in these modalities is crucial for understanding this relationship but is hindered by the high-dimensionality, complex spatiotemporal dependencies, and prevalent behaviorally irrelevant dynamics in these modalities. Existing dynamical models often employ preprocessing steps to obtain low-dimensional representations from neural image modalities. However, this process can discard behaviorally relevant information and miss spatiotemporal structure. We propose SBIND, a novel data-driven deep learning framework to model spatiotemporal dependencies in neural images and disentangle their behaviorally relevant dynamics from other neural dynamics. We validate SBIND on widefield imaging datasets, and show its extension to functional ultrasound imaging, a recent modality whose dynamical modeling has largely remained unexplored. We find that our model effectively identifies both local and long-range spatial dependencies across the brain while also dissociating behaviorally relevant neural dynamics. Doing so, SBIND outperforms existing models in neural-behavioral prediction. Overall, SBIND provides a versatile tool for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying behavior using imaging modalities.</description>

      <title>A Rhythm-Aware Phrase Insertion for Classical Arabic Poetry Composition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a methodology for inserting phrases in Arabic poems to conform to a specific rhythm using ByT5, a byte-level multilingual transformer-based model. Our work discusses a rule-based grapheme-to-beat transformation tailored for extracting the rhythm from fully diacritized Arabic script. Our approach employs a conditional denoising objective to fine-tune ByT5, where the model reconstructs masked words to match a target rhythm. We adopt a curriculum learning strategy, pre-training on a general Arabic dataset before fine-tuning on poetic dataset, and explore cross-lingual transfer from English to Arabic. Experimental results demonstrate that our models achieve high rhythmic alignment while maintaining semantic coherence. The proposed model has the potential to be used in co-creative applications in the process of composing classical Arabic poems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum data re-uploading has proved powerful for classical inputs, where repeatedly encoding features into a small circuit yields universal function approximation. Extending this idea to quantum inputs remains underexplored, as the information contained in a quantum state is not directly accessible in classical form. We propose and analyze a quantum data re-uploading architecture in which a qubit interacts sequentially with fresh copies of an arbitrary input state. The circuit can approximate any bounded continuous function using only one ancilla qubit and single-qubit measurements. By alternating entangling unitaries with mid-circuit resets of the input register, the architecture realizes a discrete cascade of completely positive and trace-preserving maps, analogous to collision models in open quantum system dynamics. Our framework provides a qubit-efficient and expressive approach to designing quantum machine learning models that operate directly on quantum data.</description>

      <title>Efficient Breast and Ovarian Cancer Classification via ViT-Based Preprocessing and Transfer Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cancer is one of the leading health challenges for women, specifically breast and ovarian cancer. Early detection can help improve the survival rate through timely intervention and treatment. Traditional methods of detecting cancer involve manually examining mammograms, CT scans, ultrasounds, and other imaging types. However, this makes the process labor-intensive and requires the expertise of trained pathologists. Hence, making it both time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this paper, we introduce a novel vision transformer (ViT)-based method for detecting and classifying breast and ovarian cancer. We use a pre-trained ViT-Base-Patch16-224 model, which is fine-tuned for both binary and multi-class classification tasks using publicly available histopathological image datasets. Further, we use a preprocessing pipeline that converts raw histophological images into standardized PyTorch tensors, which are compatible with the ViT architecture and also help improve the model performance. We evaluated the performance of our model on two benchmark datasets: the BreakHis dataset for binary classification and the UBC-OCEAN dataset for five-class classification without any data augmentation. Our model surpasses existing CNN, ViT, and topological data analysis-based approaches in binary classification. For multi-class classification, it is evaluated against recent topological methods and demonstrates superior performance. Our study highlights the effectiveness of Vision Transformer-based transfer learning combined with efficient preprocessing in oncological diagnostics.</description>

      <title>VLN-Zero: Rapid Exploration and Cache-Enabled Neurosymbolic Vision-Language Planning for Zero-Shot Transfer in Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid adaptation in unseen environments is essential for scalable real-world autonomy, yet existing approaches rely on exhaustive exploration or rigid navigation policies that fail to generalize. We present VLN-Zero, a two-phase vision-language navigation framework that leverages vision-language models to efficiently construct symbolic scene graphs and enable zero-shot neurosymbolic navigation. In the exploration phase, structured prompts guide VLM-based search toward informative and diverse trajectories, yielding compact scene graph representations. In the deployment phase, a neurosymbolic planner reasons over the scene graph and environmental observations to generate executable plans, while a cache-enabled execution module accelerates adaptation by reusing previously computed task-location trajectories. By combining rapid exploration, symbolic reasoning, and cache-enabled execution, the proposed framework overcomes the computational inefficiency and poor generalization of prior vision-language navigation methods, enabling robust and scalable decision-making in unseen environments. VLN-Zero achieves 2x higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot models, outperforms most fine-tuned baselines, and reaches goal locations in half the time with 55% fewer VLM calls on average compared to state-of-the-art models across diverse environments. Codebase, datasets, and videos for VLN-Zero are available at: https://vln-zero.github.io/.</description>

      <title>BRAID: Input-Driven Nonlinear Dynamical Modeling of Neural-Behavioral Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural populations exhibit complex recurrent structures that drive behavior, while continuously receiving and integrating external inputs from sensory stimuli, upstream regions, and neurostimulation. However, neural populations are often modeled as autonomous dynamical systems, with little consideration given to the influence of external inputs that shape the population activity and behavioral outcomes. Here, we introduce BRAID, a deep learning framework that models nonlinear neural dynamics underlying behavior while explicitly incorporating any measured external inputs. Our method disentangles intrinsic recurrent neural population dynamics from the effects of inputs by including a forecasting objective within input-driven recurrent neural networks. BRAID further prioritizes the learning of intrinsic dynamics that are related to a behavior of interest by using a multi-stage optimization scheme. We validate BRAID with nonlinear simulations, showing that it can accurately learn the intrinsic dynamics shared between neural and behavioral modalities. We then apply BRAID to motor cortical activity recorded during a motor task and demonstrate that our method more accurately fits the neural-behavioral data by incorporating measured sensory stimuli into the model and improves the forecasting of neural-behavioral data compared with various baseline methods, whether input-driven or not.</description>

      <title>Online Learning for Optimizing AoI-Energy Tradeoff under Unknown Channel Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a real-time monitoring system where a source node (with energy limitations) aims to keep the information status at a destination node as fresh as possible by scheduling status update transmissions over a set of channels. The freshness of information at the destination node is measured in terms of the Age of Information (AoI) metric. In this setting, a natural tradeoff exists between the transmission cost (or equivalently, energy consumption) of the source and the achievable AoI performance at the destination. This tradeoff has been optimized in the existing literature under the assumption of having a complete knowledge of the channel statistics. In this work, we develop online learning-based algorithms with finite-time guarantees that optimize this tradeoff in the practical scenario where the channel statistics are unknown to the scheduler. In particular, when the channel statistics are known, the optimal scheduling policy is first proven to have a threshold-based structure with respect to the value of AoI (i.e., it is optimal to drop updates when the AoI value is below some threshold). This key insight was then utilized to develop the proposed learning algorithms that surprisingly achieve an order-optimal regret (i.e., $O(1)$) with respect to the time horizon length.</description>

      <title>Scalable bayesian shadow tomography for quantum property estimation with set transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A scalable Bayesian machine learning framework is introduced for estimating scalar properties of an unknown quantum state from measurement data, which bypasses full density matrix reconstruction. This work is the first to integrate the classical shadows protocol with a permutation-invariant set transformer architecture, enabling the approach to predict and correct bias in existing estimators to approximate the true Bayesian posterior mean. Measurement outcomes are encoded as fixed-dimensional feature vectors, and the network outputs a residual correction to a baseline estimator. Scalability to large quantum systems is ensured by the polynomial dependence of input size on system size and number of measurements. On Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state fidelity and second-order R\'enyi entropy estimation tasks -- using random Pauli and random Clifford measurements -- this Bayesian estimator always achieves lower mean squared error than classical shadows alone, with more than a 99\% reduction in the few copy regime.</description>

      <title>Query-Centric Diffusion Policy for Generalizable Robotic Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The robotic assembly task poses a key challenge in building generalist robots due to the intrinsic complexity of part interactions and the sensitivity to noise perturbations in contact-rich settings. The assembly agent is typically designed in a hierarchical manner: high-level multi-part reasoning and low-level precise control. However, implementing such a hierarchical policy is challenging in practice due to the mismatch between high-level skill queries and low-level execution. To address this, we propose the Query-centric Diffusion Policy (QDP), a hierarchical framework that bridges high-level planning and low-level control by utilizing queries comprising objects, contact points, and skill information. QDP introduces a query-centric mechanism that identifies task-relevant components and uses them to guide low-level policies, leveraging point cloud observations to improve the policy's robustness. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the FurnitureBench in both simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating improved performance in skill precision and long-horizon success rate. In the challenging insertion and screwing tasks, QDP improves the skill-wise success rate by over 50% compared to baselines without structured queries.</description>

      <title>Learning When to Restart: Nonstationary Newsvendor from Uncensored to Censored Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study nonstationary newsvendor problems under nonparametric demand models and general distributional measures of nonstationarity, addressing the practical challenges of unknown degree of nonstationarity and demand censoring. We propose a novel distributional-detection-and-restart framework for learning in nonstationary environments, and instantiate it through two efficient algorithms for the uncensored and censored demand settings. The algorithms are fully adaptive, requiring no prior knowledge of the degree and type of nonstationarity, and offer a flexible yet powerful approach to handling both abrupt and gradual changes in nonstationary environments. We establish a comprehensive optimality theory for our algorithms by deriving matching regret upper and lower bounds under both general and refined structural conditions with nontrivial proof techniques that are of independent interest. Numerical experiments using real-world datasets, including nurse staffing data for emergency departments and COVID-19 test demand data, showcase the algorithms' superior and robust empirical performance. While motivated by the newsvendor problem, the distributional-detection-and-restart framework applies broadly to a wide class of nonstationary stochastic optimization problems. Managerially, our framework provides a practical, easy-to-deploy, and theoretically grounded solution for decision-making under nonstationarity.</description>

      <title>Consistency of Selection Strategies for Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies how insurers can chose which claims to investigate for fraud. Given a prediction model, typically only claims with the highest predicted propability of being fraudulent are investigated. We argue that this can lead to inconsistent learning and propose a randomized alternative. More generally, we draw a parallel with the multi-arm bandit literature and argue that, in the presence of selection, the obtained observations are not iid. Hence, dependence on past observations should be accounted for when updating parameter estimates. We formalize selection in a binary regression framework and show that model updating and maximum-likelihood estimation can be implemented as if claims were investigated at random. Then, we define consistency of selection strategies and conjecture sufficient conditions for consistency. Our simulations suggest that the often-used selection strategy can be inconsistent while the proposed randomized alternative is consistent. Finally, we compare our randomized selection strategy with Thompson sampling, a standard multi-arm bandit heuristic. Our simulations suggest that the latter can be inefficient in learning low fraud probabilities.</description>

      <title>Security smells in infrastructure as code: a taxonomy update beyond the seven sins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has become essential for modern software management, yet security flaws in IaC scripts can have severe consequences, as exemplified by the recurring exploits of Cloud Web Services. Prior work has recognized the need to build a precise taxonomy of security smells in IaC scripts as a first step towards developing approaches to improve IaC security. This first effort led to the unveiling of seven sins, limited by the focus on a single IaC tool as well as by the extensive, and potentially biased, manual effort that was required. We propose, in our work, to revisit this taxonomy: first, we extend the study of IaC security smells to a more diverse dataset with scripts associated with seven popular IaC tools, including Terraform, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Pulumi, Saltstack, and Vagrant; second, we bring in some automation for the analysis by relying on an LLM. While we leverage LLMs for initial pattern processing, all taxonomic decisions underwent systematic human validation and reconciliation with established security standards. Our study yields a comprehensive taxonomy of 62 security smell categories, significantly expanding beyond the previously known seven. We demonstrate actionability by implementing new security checking rules within linters for seven popular IaC tools, often achieving 1.00 precision score. Our evolution study of security smells in GitHub projects reveals that these issues persist for extended periods, likely due to inadequate detection and mitigation tools. This work provides IaC practitioners with insights for addressing common security smells and systematically adopting DevSecOps practices to build safer infrastructure code.</description>

      <title>AECBench: A Hierarchical Benchmark for Knowledge Evaluation of Large Language Models in the AEC Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), as a novel information technology, are seeing increasing adoption in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) field. They have shown their potential to streamline processes throughout the building lifecycle. However, the robustness and reliability of LLMs in such a specialized and safety-critical domain remain to be evaluated. To address this challenge, this paper establishes AECBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to quantify the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in the AEC domain. The benchmark defines 23 representative tasks within a five-level cognition-oriented evaluation framework encompassing Knowledge Memorization, Understanding, Reasoning, Calculation, and Application. These tasks were derived from authentic AEC practice, with scope ranging from codes retrieval to specialized documents generation. Subsequently, a 4,800-question dataset encompassing diverse formats, including open-ended questions, was crafted primarily by engineers and validated through a two-round expert review. Furthermore, an LLM-as-a-Judge approach was introduced to provide a scalable and consistent methodology for evaluating complex, long-form responses leveraging expert-derived rubrics. Through the evaluation of nine LLMs, a clear performance decline across five cognitive levels was revealed. Despite demonstrating proficiency in foundational tasks at the Knowledge Memorization and Understanding levels, the models showed significant performance deficits, particularly in interpreting knowledge from tables in building codes, executing complex reasoning and calculation, and generating domain-specific documents. Consequently, this study lays the groundwork for future research and development aimed at the robust and reliable integration of LLMs into safety-critical engineering practices.</description>

      <title>Real-time Deer Detection and Warning in Connected Vehicles via Thermal Sensing and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deer-vehicle collisions represent a critical safety challenge in the United States, causing nearly 2.1 million incidents annually and resulting in approximately 440 fatalities, 59,000 injuries, and 10 billion USD in economic damages. These collisions also contribute significantly to declining deer populations. This paper presents a real-time detection and driver warning system that integrates thermal imaging, deep learning, and vehicle-to-everything communication to help mitigate deer-vehicle collisions. Our system was trained and validated on a custom dataset of over 12,000 thermal deer images collected in Mars Hill, North Carolina. Experimental evaluation demonstrates exceptional performance with 98.84 percent mean average precision, 95.44 percent precision, and 95.96 percent recall. The system was field tested during a follow-up visit to Mars Hill and readily sensed deer providing the driver with advanced warning. Field testing validates robust operation across diverse weather conditions, with thermal imaging maintaining between 88 and 92 percent detection accuracy in challenging scenarios where conventional visible light based cameras achieve less than 60 percent effectiveness. When a high probability threshold is reached sensor data sharing messages are broadcast to surrounding vehicles and roadside units via cellular vehicle to everything (CV2X) communication devices. Overall, our system achieves end to end latency consistently under 100 milliseconds from detection to driver alert. This research establishes a viable technological pathway for reducing deer-vehicle collisions through thermal imaging and connected vehicles.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Optical Coherence Tomography Images from Wavelength-space Using Deep-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional Fourier-domain Optical Coherence Tomography (FD-OCT) systems depend on resampling into wavenumber (k) domain to extract the depth profile. This either necessitates additional hardware resources or amplifies the existing computational complexity. Moreover, the OCT images also suffer from speckle noise, due to systemic reliance on low coherence interferometry. We propose a streamlined and computationally efficient approach based on Deep-Learning (DL) which enables reconstructing speckle-reduced OCT images directly from the wavelength domain. For reconstruction, two encoder-decoder styled networks namely Spatial Domain Convolution Neural Network (SD-CNN) and Fourier Domain CNN (FD-CNN) are used sequentially. The SD-CNN exploits the highly degraded images obtained by Fourier transforming the domain fringes to reconstruct the deteriorated morphological structures along with suppression of unwanted noise. The FD-CNN leverages this output to enhance the image quality further by optimization in Fourier domain (FD). We quantitatively and visually demonstrate the efficacy of the method in obtaining high-quality OCT images. Furthermore, we illustrate the computational complexity reduction by harnessing the power of DL models. We believe that this work lays the framework for further innovations in the realm of OCT image reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Detection of security smells in IaC scripts through semantics-aware code and language processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates the provisioning and management of IT infrastructure through scripts and tools, streamlining software deployment. Prior studies have shown that IaC scripts often contain recurring security misconfigurations, and several detection and mitigation approaches have been proposed. Most of these rely on static analysis, using statistical code representations or Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to distinguish insecure configurations from safe code.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that enhances static analysis with semantic understanding by jointly leveraging natural language and code representations. Our method builds on two complementary ML models: CodeBERT, to capture semantics across code and text, and LongFormer, to represent long IaC scripts without losing contextual information. We evaluate our approach on misconfiguration datasets from two widely used IaC tools, Ansible and Puppet. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct two ablation studies (removing code text from the natural language input and truncating scripts to reduce context) and compare against four large language models (LLMs) and prior work. Results show that semantic enrichment substantially improves detection, raising precision and recall from 0.46 and 0.79 to 0.92 and 0.88 on Ansible, and from 0.55 and 0.97 to 0.87 and 0.75 on Puppet, respectively.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Policy Mirror Descent with Temporal Difference Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy mirror descent (PMD) is a general policy optimization framework in reinforcement learning, which can cover a wide range of typical policy optimization methods by specifying different mirror maps. Existing analysis of PMD requires exact or approximate evaluation (for example unbiased estimation via Monte Carlo simulation) of action values solely based on policy. In this paper, we consider policy mirror descent with temporal difference evaluation (TD-PMD). It is shown that, given the access to exact policy evaluations, the dimension-free $O(1/T)$ sublinear convergence still holds for TD-PMD with any constant step size and any initialization. In order to achieve this result, new monotonicity and shift invariance arguments have been developed. The dimension free $\gamma$-rate linear convergence of TD-PMD is also established provided the step size is selected adaptively. For the two common instances of TD-PMD (i.e., TD-PQA and TD-NPG), it is further shown that they enjoy the convergence in the policy domain. Additionally, we investigate TD-PMD in the inexact setting and give the sample complexity for it to achieve the last iterate $\varepsilon$-optimality under a generative model, which improves the last iterate sample complexity for PMD over the dependence on $1/(1-\gamma)$.</description>

      <title>DexSkin: High-Coverage Conformable Robotic Skin for Learning Contact-Rich Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human skin provides a rich tactile sensing stream, localizing intentional and unintentional contact events over a large and contoured region. Replicating these tactile sensing capabilities for dexterous robotic manipulation systems remains a longstanding challenge. In this work, we take a step towards this goal by introducing DexSkin. DexSkin is a soft, conformable capacitive electronic skin that enables sensitive, localized, and calibratable tactile sensing, and can be tailored to varying geometries. We demonstrate its efficacy for learning downstream robotic manipulation by sensorizing a pair of parallel jaw gripper fingers, providing tactile coverage across almost the entire finger surfaces. We empirically evaluate DexSkin's capabilities in learning challenging manipulation tasks that require sensing coverage across the entire surface of the fingers, such as reorienting objects in hand and wrapping elastic bands around boxes, in a learning-from-demonstration framework. We then show that, critically for data-driven approaches, DexSkin can be calibrated to enable model transfer across sensor instances, and demonstrate its applicability to online reinforcement learning on real robots. Our results highlight DexSkin's suitability and practicality for learning real-world, contact-rich manipulation.

      <title>Text Slider: Efficient and Plug-and-Play Continuous Concept Control for Image/Video Synthesis via LoRA Adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image and video synthesis. In addition, several concept control methods have been proposed to enable fine-grained, continuous, and flexible control over free-form text prompts. However, these methods not only require intensive training time and GPU memory usage to learn the sliders or embeddings but also need to be retrained for different diffusion backbones, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address these limitations, we introduce Text Slider, a lightweight, efficient and plug-and-play framework that identifies low-rank directions within a pre-trained text encoder, enabling continuous control of visual concepts while significantly reducing training time, GPU memory consumption, and the number of trainable parameters. Furthermore, Text Slider supports multi-concept composition and continuous control, enabling fine-grained and flexible manipulation in both image and video synthesis. We show that Text Slider enables smooth and continuous modulation of specific attributes while preserving the original spatial layout and structure of the input. Text Slider achieves significantly better efficiency: 5$\times$ faster training than Concept Slider and 47$\times$ faster than Attribute Control, while reducing GPU memory usage by nearly 2$\times$ and 4$\times$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Are Smaller Open-Weight LLMs Closing the Gap to Proprietary Models for Biomedical Question Answering?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-weight versions of large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing, with state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-V3 now performing comparably to proprietary LLMs. This progression raises the question of whether small open-weight LLMs are capable of effectively replacing larger closed-source models. We are particularly interested in the context of biomedical question-answering, a domain we explored by participating in Task 13B Phase B of the BioASQ challenge. In this work, we compare several open-weight models against top-performing systems such as GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet. To enhance question answering capabilities, we use various techniques including retrieving the most relevant snippets based on embedding distance, in-context learning, and structured outputs. For certain submissions, we utilize ensemble approaches to leverage the diverse outputs generated by different models for exact-answer questions. Our results demonstrate that open-weight LLMs are comparable to proprietary ones. In some instances, open-weight LLMs even surpassed their closed counterparts, particularly when ensembling strategies were applied. All code is publicly available at https://github.com/evidenceprime/BioASQ-13b.</description>

      <title>Bi-VLA: Bilateral Control-Based Imitation Learning via Vision-Language Fusion for Action Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Bilateral Control-Based Imitation Learning via Vision-Language Fusion for Action Generation (Bi-VLA), a novel framework that extends bilateral control-based imitation learning to handle more than one task within a single model. Conventional bilateral control methods exploit joint angle, velocity, torque, and vision for precise manipulation but require task-specific models, limiting their generality. Bi-VLA overcomes this limitation by utilizing robot joint angle, velocity, and torque data from leader-follower bilateral control with visual features and natural language instructions through SigLIP and FiLM-based fusion. We validated Bi-VLA on two task types: one requiring supplementary language cues and another distinguishable solely by vision. Real-robot experiments showed that Bi-VLA successfully interprets vision-language combinations and improves task success rates compared to conventional bilateral control-based imitation learning. Our Bi-VLA addresses the single-task limitation of prior bilateral approaches and provides empirical evidence that combining vision and language significantly enhances versatility. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of Bi-VLA in real-world tasks. For additional material, please visit the website: https://mertcookimg.github.io/bi-vla/</description>

      <title>Diversity Boosts AI-Generated Text Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting AI-generated text is an increasing necessity to combat misuse of LLMs in education, business compliance, journalism, and social media, where synthetic fluency can mask misinformation or deception. While prior detectors often rely on token-level likelihoods or opaque black-box classifiers, these approaches struggle against high-quality generations and offer little interpretability. In this work, we propose DivEye, a novel detection framework that captures how unpredictability fluctuates across a text using surprisal-based features. Motivated by the observation that human-authored text exhibits richer variability in lexical and structural unpredictability than LLM outputs, DivEye captures this signal through a set of interpretable statistical features. Our method outperforms existing zero-shot detectors by up to 33.2% and achieves competitive performance with fine-tuned baselines across multiple benchmarks. DivEye is robust to paraphrasing and adversarial attacks, generalizes well across domains and models, and improves the performance of existing detectors by up to 18.7% when used as an auxiliary signal. Beyond detection, DivEye provides interpretable insights into why a text is flagged, pointing to rhythmic unpredictability as a powerful and underexplored signal for LLM detection.</description>

      <title>Confidential LLM Inference: Performance and Cost Across CPU and GPU TEEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on converged Cloud and High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure. However, as LLMs handle confidential inputs and are fine-tuned on costly, proprietary datasets, their heightened security requirements slow adoption in privacy-sensitive sectors such as healthcare and finance. We investigate methods to address this gap and propose Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as a solution for securing end-to-end LLM inference. We validate their practicality by evaluating these compute-intensive workloads entirely within CPU and GPU TEEs. On the CPU side, we conduct an in-depth study running full Llama2 inference pipelines (7B, 13B, 70B) inside Intel's TDX and SGX, accelerated by Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX). We derive 12 insights, including that across various data types, batch sizes, and input lengths, CPU TEEs impose under 10% throughput and 20% latency overheads, further reduced by AMX. We run LLM inference on NVIDIA H100 Confidential Compute GPUs, contextualizing our CPU findings and observing throughput penalties of 4-8% that diminish as batch and input sizes grow. By comparing performance, cost, and security trade-offs, we show how CPU TEEs can be more cost-effective or secure than their GPU counterparts. To our knowledge, our work is the first to comprehensively demonstrate the performance and practicality of modern TEEs across both CPUs and GPUs for enabling confidential LLMs (cLLMs).</description>

      <title>Integrating Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces and Power Control for Dynamic Edge Inference via Over-The-Air Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for Edge Inference (EI) that bypasses the conventional practice of treating the wireless channel as noise. We utilize Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIMs) to control wireless propagation, enabling the channel itself to perform over-the-air computation. This eliminates the need for symbol estimation at the receiver, significantly reducing computational and communication overhead. Our approach models the transmitter-channel-receiver system as an end-to-end Deep Neural Network (DNN) where the response of the SIM elements are trainable parameters. To address channel variability, we incorporate a dedicated DNN module responsible for dynamically adjusting transmission power leveraging user location information. Our performance evaluations showcase that the proposed metasurfaces-integrated DNN framework with deep SIM architectures are capable of balancing classification accuracy and power consumption under diverse scenarios, offering significant energy efficiency improvements.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Efficient Prediction of Wi-Fi Link Quality Based on Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless communications are characterized by their unpredictability, posing challenges for maintaining consistent communication quality. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of various prediction models, with a focus on achieving accurate and efficient Wi-Fi link quality forecasts using machine learning techniques. Specifically, the paper evaluates the performance of data-driven models based on the linear combination of exponential moving averages, which are designed for low-complexity implementations and are then suitable for hardware platforms with limited processing resources. Accuracy of the proposed approaches was assessed using experimental data from a real-world Wi-Fi testbed, considering both channel-dependent and channel-independent training data. Remarkably, channel-independent models, which allow for generalized training by equipment manufacturers, demonstrated competitive performance. Overall, this study provides insights into the practical deployment of machine learning-based prediction models for enhancing Wi-Fi dependability in industrial environments.</description>

      <title>No Labels Needed: Zero-Shot Image Classification with Collaborative Self-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While deep learning, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), has significantly advanced classification performance, its typical reliance on extensive annotated datasets presents a major obstacle in many practical scenarios where such data is scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs) and transfer learning with pre-trained visual models appear as promising techniques to deal with this problem. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot image classification framework that combines a VLM and a pre-trained visual model within a self-learning cycle. Requiring only the set of class names and no labeled training data, our method utilizes a confidence-based pseudo-labeling strategy to train a lightweight classifier directly on the test data, enabling dynamic adaptation. The VLM identifies high-confidence samples, and the pre-trained visual model enhances their visual representations. These enhanced features then iteratively train the classifier, allowing the system to capture complementary semantic and visual cues without supervision. Notably, our approach avoids VLM fine-tuning and the use of large language models, relying on the visual-only model to reduce the dependence on semantic representation. Experimental evaluations on ten diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline zero-shot method.</description>

      <title>Generative data augmentation for biliary tract detection on intraoperative images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cholecystectomy is one of the most frequently performed procedures in gastrointestinal surgery, and the laparoscopic approach is the gold standard for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis and acute cholecystitis. In addition to the advantages of a significantly faster recovery and better cosmetic results, the laparoscopic approach bears a higher risk of bile duct injury, which has a significant impact on quality of life and survival. To avoid bile duct injury, it is essential to improve the intraoperative visualization of the bile duct. This work aims to address this problem by leveraging a deep-learning approach for the localization of the biliary tract from white-light images acquired during the surgical procedures. To this end, the construction and annotation of an image database to train the Yolo detection algorithm has been employed. Besides classical data augmentation techniques, the paper proposes Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for the generation of a synthetic portion of the training dataset. Experimental results have been discussed along with ethical considerations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Calibration and Model Assessment of Cell Migration Dynamics with Surrogate Model Integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational models provide crucial insights into complex biological processes such as cancer evolution, but their mechanistic nature often makes them nonlinear and parameter-rich, complicating calibration. We systematically evaluate parameter probability distributions in cell migration models using Bayesian calibration across four complementary strategies: parametric and surrogate models, each with and without explicit model discrepancy. This approach enables joint analysis of parameter uncertainty, predictive performance, and interpretability. Applied to a real data experiment of glioblastoma progression in microfluidic devices, surrogate models achieve higher computational efficiency and predictive accuracy, whereas parametric models yield more reliable parameter estimates due to their mechanistic grounding. Incorporating model discrepancy exposes structural limitations, clarifying where model refinement is necessary. Together, these comparisons offer practical guidance for calibrating and improving computational models of complex biological systems.</description>

      <title>VIR-Bench: Evaluating Geospatial and Temporal Understanding of MLLMs via Travel Video Itinerary Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced video understanding capabilities, opening new possibilities for practical applications. Yet current video benchmarks focus largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing for Minimum Bisection Problem: A Machine Learning-based Approach for Penalty Parameter Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Minimum Bisection Problem is a well-known NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, with practical applications in areas such as parallel computing, network design, and machine learning. In this paper, we examine the potential of using D-Wave Systems' quantum annealing solvers to solve the Minimum Bisection Problem, which we formulate as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization model. A key challenge in this formulation lies in choosing an appropriate penalty parameter, as it plays a crucial role in ensuring both the quality of the solution and the satisfaction of the problem's constraints. To address this, we introduce a novel machine learning-based approach for adaptive tuning of the penalty parameter. Specifically, we use a Gradient Boosting Regressor model trained to predict suitable penalty parameter values based on structural properties of the input graph, the number of nodes and the graph's density. This method enables the penalty parameter to be adjusted dynamically for each specific problem instance, improving the solver's ability to balance the competing goals of minimizing the cut size and maintaining equally sized partitions. We test our approach on a large dataset of randomly generated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs with up to 4,000 nodes, and we compare the results with classical partitioning algorithms, Metis and Kernighan-Lin. Experimental findings demonstrate that our adaptive tuning strategy significantly improves the performance of the quantum annealing hybrid solver and consistently outperforms the classical methods used, indicating its potential as an alternative for the graph partitioning problem.</description>

      <title>A Fast Initialization Method for Neural Network Controllers: A Case Study of Image-based Visual Servoing Control for the multicopter Interception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based controller design methods often require substantial data in the initial training phase. Moreover, the training process tends to exhibit strong randomness and slow convergence. It often requires considerable time or high computational resources. Another class of learning-based method incorporates Lyapunov stability theory to obtain a control policy with stability guarantees. However, these methods generally require an initially stable neural network control policy at the beginning of training. Evidently, a stable neural network controller can not only serve as an initial policy for reinforcement learning, allowing the training to focus on improving controller performance, but also act as an initial state for learning-based Lyapunov control methods. Although stable controllers can be designed using traditional control theory, designers still need to have a great deal of control design knowledge to address increasingly complicated control problems. The proposed neural network rapid initialization method in this paper achieves the initial training of the neural network control policy by constructing datasets that conform to the stability conditions based on the system model. Furthermore, using the image-based visual servoing control for multicopter interception as a case study, simulations and experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness and practical performance of the proposed method. In the experiment, the trained control policy attains a final interception velocity of 15 m/s.</description>

      <title>LLM-based Vulnerability Discovery through the Lens of Code Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks of software engineering, yet progress in leveraging them for vulnerability discovery has stalled in recent years. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate LLMs through the lens of classic code metrics. Surprisingly, we find that a classifier trained solely on these metrics performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs for vulnerability discovery. A root-cause analysis reveals a strong correlation and a causal effect between LLMs and code metrics: When the value of a metric is changed, LLM predictions tend to shift by a corresponding magnitude. This dependency suggests that LLMs operate at a similarly shallow level as code metrics, limiting their ability to grasp complex patterns and fully realize their potential in vulnerability discovery. Based on these findings, we derive recommendations on how research should more effectively address this challenge.</description>

      <title>Circuit Complexity From Physical Constraints: Scaling Limitations of Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the standard circuit complexity measures derived from $NC, AC, TC$ provide limited practical information and are now insufficient to further differentiate model expressivity. To address these new limitations, we define a novel notion of local uniformity and a family of circuit complexity classes $RC(\cdot)$ that capture the fundamental constraints of scaling physical circuits. Through the lens of $RC(\cdot)$, we show that attention mechanisms with $\omega(n^{3/2})$ runtime cannot scale to accommodate the entropy of increasingly complex datasets. Our results simultaneously provide a methodology for defining meaningful bounds on transformer expressivity and naturally expose the restricted viability of attention.</description>

      <title>CayleyPy Growth: Efficient growth computations and hundreds of new conjectures on Cayley graphs (Brief version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the third paper of the CayleyPy project applying artificial intelligence to problems in group theory. We announce the first public release of CayleyPy, an open source Python library for computations with Cayley and Schreier graphs. Compared with systems such as GAP and Sage, CayleyPy handles much larger graphs and performs several orders of magnitude faster.
  Using CayleyPy we obtained about 200 new conjectures on Cayley and Schreier graphs, focused on diameters and growth. For many Cayley graphs of symmetric groups Sn we observe quasi polynomial diameter formulas: a small set of quadratic or linear polynomials indexed by n mod s. We conjecture that this is a general phenomenon, giving efficient diameter computation despite the problem being NP hard. We propose a refinement of the Babai type conjecture on diameters of Sn: n^2/2 + 4n upper bounds in the undirected case, compared to previous O(n^2) bounds. We also provide explicit generator families, related to involutions in a square with whiskers pattern, conjectured to maximize the diameter; search confirms this for all n up to 15. We further conjecture an answer to a question posed by V M Glushkov in 1968 on directed Cayley graphs generated by a cyclic shift and a transposition.
  For nilpotent groups we conjecture an improvement of J S Ellenberg's results on upper unitriangular matrices over Z/pZ, showing linear dependence of diameter on p. Moreover.
  Some conjectures are LLM friendly, naturally stated as sorting problems verifiable by algorithms or Python code. To benchmark path finding we created more than 10 Kaggle datasets. CayleyPy works with arbitrary permutation or matrix groups and includes over 100 predefined generators. Our growth computation code outperforms GAP and Sage up to 1000 times in speed and size.</description>

      <title>Soft Tokens, Hard Truths</title>

Abstract: The use of continuous instead of discrete tokens during the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) phase of reasoning LLMs has garnered attention recently, based on the intuition that a continuous mixture of discrete tokens could simulate a superposition of several reasoning paths simultaneously. Theoretical results have formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and can solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of continuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous works either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained discrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth discrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few tokens.
  This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs via reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete CoTs. We use "soft" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input embedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal, enabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning benchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs match discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing greater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario is to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference, meaning the "soft" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show continuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model on out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model.</description>

Abstract: This entry description proposes AlloyInter, a novel system to enable joint exploration of input mixtures and output parameters space in the context of the SciVis Contest 2025. We propose an interpolation approach, guided by eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) based on a learned model ensemble that allows users to discover input mixture ratios by specifying output parameter goals that can be iteratively adjusted and improved towards a goal. We strengthen the capabilities of our system by building upon prior research within the robustness of XAI, as well as combining well-established techniques like manifold learning with interpolation approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes the use of the Hellinger--Kantorovich metric from unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) in a dimensionality reduction and learning (supervised and unsupervised) pipeline. The performance of UOT is compared to that of regular OT and Euclidean-based dimensionality reduction methods on several benchmark datasets including MedMNIST. The experimental results demonstrate that, on average, UOT shows improvement over both Euclidean and OT-based methods as verified by statistical hypothesis tests. In particular, on the MedMNIST datasets, UOT outperforms OT in classification 81\% of the time. For clustering MedMNIST, UOT outperforms OT 83\% of the time and outperforms both other metrics 58\% of the time.</description>

      <title>Linear Regression under Missing or Corrupted Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study multivariate linear regression under Gaussian covariates in two settings, where data may be erased or corrupted by an adversary under a coordinate-wise budget. In the incomplete data setting, an adversary may inspect the dataset and delete entries in up to an $\eta$-fraction of samples per coordinate; a strong form of the Missing Not At Random model. In the corrupted data setting, the adversary instead replaces values arbitrarily, and the corruption locations are unknown to the learner. Despite substantial work on missing data, linear regression under such adversarial missingness remains poorly understood, even information-theoretically. Unlike the clean setting, where estimation error vanishes with more samples, here the optimal error remains a positive function of the problem parameters. Our main contribution is to characterize this error up to constant factors across essentially the entire parameter range. Specifically, we establish novel information-theoretic lower bounds on the achievable error that match the error of (computationally efficient) algorithms. A key implication is that, perhaps surprisingly, the optimal error in the missing data setting matches that in the corruption setting-so knowing the corruption locations offers no general advantage.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational resources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains conventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data (RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast to prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning, RLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to learn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement learning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) rely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this dependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data. Specifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the policy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the preceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training data, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader contexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive experiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across multiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied to Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$, $6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and AIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling behavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In addition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries of LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes two algorithms for estimating square Wasserstein distance matrices from a small number of entries. These matrices are used to compute manifold learning embeddings like multidimensional scaling (MDS) or Isomap, but contrary to Euclidean distance matrices, are extremely costly to compute. We analyze matrix completion from upper triangular samples and Nystr\"{o}m completion in which $\mathcal{O}(d\log(d))$ columns of the distance matrices are computed where $d$ is the desired embedding dimension, prove stability of MDS under Nystr\"{o}m completion, and show that it can outperform matrix completion for a fixed budget of sample distances. Finally, we show that classification of the OrganCMNIST dataset from the MedMNIST benchmark is stable on data embedded from the Nystr\"{o}m estimation of the distance matrix even when only 10\% of the columns are computed.</description>

      <title>Discovering strategies for coastal resilience with AI-based prediction and optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tropical storms cause extensive property damage and loss of life, making them one of the most destructive types of natural hazards. The development of predictive models that identify interventions effective at mitigating storm impacts has considerable potential to reduce these adverse outcomes. In this study, we use an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approach for optimizing intervention schemes that improve resilience to coastal flooding. We combine three different AI models to optimize the selection of intervention types, sites, and scales in order to minimize the expected cost of flooding damage in a given region, including the cost of installing and maintaining interventions. Our approach combines data-driven generation of storm surge fields, surrogate modeling of intervention impacts, and the solving of a continuous-armed bandit problem. We applied this methodology to optimize the selection of sea wall and oyster reef interventions near Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB) in Florida, an area that was catastrophically impacted by Hurricane Michael. Our analysis predicts that intervention optimization could be used to potentially save billions of dollars in storm damage, far outpacing greedy or non-optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>WolBanking77: Wolof Banking Speech Intent Classification Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intent classification models have made a lot of progress in recent years. However, previous studies primarily focus on high-resource languages datasets, which results in a gap for low-resource languages and for regions with a high rate of illiterate people where languages are more spoken than read or written. This is the case in Senegal, for example, where Wolof is spoken by around 90\% of the population, with an illiteracy rate of 42\% for the country. Wolof is actually spoken by more than 10 million people in West African region. To tackle such limitations, we release a Wolof Intent Classification Dataset (WolBanking77), for academic research in intent classification. WolBanking77 currently contains 9,791 text sentences in the banking domain and more than 4 hours of spoken sentences. Experiments on various baselines are conducted in this work, including text and voice state-of-the-art models. The results are very promising on this current dataset. This paper also provides detailed analyses of the contents of the data. We report baseline f1-score and word error rate metrics respectively on NLP and ASR models trained on WolBanking77 dataset and also comparisons between models. We plan to share and conduct dataset maintenance, updates and to release open-source code.</description>

Abstract: Solving ill-posed inverse problems requires powerful and flexible priors. We propose leveraging pretrained latent diffusion models for this task through a new training-free approach, termed Diffusion-regularized Wasserstein Gradient Flow (DWGF). Specifically, we formulate the posterior sampling problem as a regularized Wasserstein gradient flow of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in the latent space. We demonstrate the performance of our method on standard benchmarks using StableDiffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) as the prior.</description>

      <title>MOIS-SAM2: Exemplar-based Segment Anything Model 2 for multilesion interactive segmentation of neurobromas in whole-body MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background and Objectives: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of numerous neurofibromas (NFs) throughout the body. Whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is the clinical standard for detection and longitudinal surveillance of NF tumor growth. Existing interactive segmentation methods fail to combine high lesion-wise precision with scalability to hundreds of lesions. This study proposes a novel interactive segmentation model tailored to this challenge.
  Methods: We introduce MOIS-SAM2, a multi-object interactive segmentation model that extends the state-of-the-art, transformer-based, promptable Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) with exemplar-based semantic propagation. MOIS-SAM2 was trained and evaluated on 119 WB-MRI scans from 84 NF1 patients acquired using T2-weighted fat-suppressed sequences. The dataset was split at the patient level into a training set and four test sets (one in-domain and three reflecting different domain shift scenarios, e.g., MRI field strength variation, low tumor burden, differences in clinical site and scanner vendor).
  Results: On the in-domain test set, MOIS-SAM2 achieved a scan-wise DSC of 0.60 against expert manual annotations, outperforming baseline 3D nnU-Net (DSC: 0.54) and SAM2 (DSC: 0.35). Performance of the proposed model was maintained under MRI field strength shift (DSC: 0.53) and scanner vendor variation (DSC: 0.50), and improved in low tumor burden cases (DSC: 0.61). Lesion detection F1 scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.78 across test sets. Preliminary inter-reader variability analysis showed model-to-expert agreement (DSC: 0.62-0.68), comparable to inter-expert agreement (DSC: 0.57-0.69).
  Conclusions: The proposed MOIS-SAM2 enables efficient and scalable interactive segmentation of NFs in WB-MRI with minimal user input and strong generalization, supporting integration into clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>SOE: Sample-Efficient Robot Policy Self-Improvement via On-Manifold Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent agents progress by continually refining their capabilities through actively exploring environments. Yet robot policies often lack sufficient exploration capability due to action mode collapse. Existing methods that encourage exploration typically rely on random perturbations, which are unsafe and induce unstable, erratic behaviors, thereby limiting their effectiveness. We propose Self-Improvement via On-Manifold Exploration (SOE), a framework that enhances policy exploration and improvement in robotic manipulation. SOE learns a compact latent representation of task-relevant factors and constrains exploration to the manifold of valid actions, ensuring safety, diversity, and effectiveness. It can be seamlessly integrated with arbitrary policy models as a plug-in module, augmenting exploration without degrading the base policy performance. Moreover, the structured latent space enables human-guided exploration, further improving efficiency and controllability. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world tasks demonstrate that SOE consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving higher task success rates, smoother and safer exploration, and superior sample efficiency. These results establish on-manifold exploration as a principled approach to sample-efficient policy self-improvement. Project website: https://ericjin2002.github.io/SOE</description>

Abstract: Audio-based pedestrian detection is a challenging task and has, thus far, only been explored in noise-limited environments. We present a new dataset, results, and a detailed analysis of the state-of-the-art in audio-based pedestrian detection in the presence of vehicular noise. In our study, we conduct three analyses: (i) cross-dataset evaluation between noisy and noise-limited environments, (ii) an assessment of the impact of noisy data on model performance, highlighting the influence of acoustic context, and (iii) an evaluation of the model's predictive robustness on out-of-domain sounds. The new dataset is a comprehensive 1321-hour roadside dataset. It incorporates traffic-rich soundscapes. Each recording includes 16kHz audio synchronized with frame-level pedestrian annotations and 1fps video thumbnails.</description>

      <title>Residual Off-Policy RL for Finetuning Behavior Cloning Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in behavior cloning (BC) have enabled impressive visuomotor control policies. However, these approaches are limited by the quality of human demonstrations, the manual effort required for data collection, and the diminishing returns from increasing offline data. In comparison, reinforcement learning (RL) trains an agent through autonomous interaction with the environment and has shown remarkable success in various domains. Still, training RL policies directly on real-world robots remains challenging due to sample inefficiency, safety concerns, and the difficulty of learning from sparse rewards for long-horizon tasks, especially for high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems. We present a recipe that combines the benefits of BC and RL through a residual learning framework. Our approach leverages BC policies as black-box bases and learns lightweight per-step residual corrections via sample-efficient off-policy RL. We demonstrate that our method requires only sparse binary reward signals and can effectively improve manipulation policies on high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems in both simulation and the real world. In particular, we demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful real-world RL training on a humanoid robot with dexterous hands. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in various vision-based tasks, pointing towards a practical pathway for deploying RL in the real world.

      <title>Global Convergence of Multi-Agent Policy Gradient in Markov Potential Games</title>

Abstract: Potential games are arguably one of the most important and widely studied classes of normal form games. They define the archetypal setting of multi-agent coordination as all agent utilities are perfectly aligned with each other via a common potential function. Can this intuitive framework be transplanted in the setting of Markov Games? What are the similarities and differences between multi-agent coordination with and without state dependence? We present a novel definition of Markov Potential Games (MPG) that generalizes prior attempts at capturing complex stateful multi-agent coordination. Counter-intuitively, insights from normal-form potential games do not carry over as MPGs can consist of settings where state-games can be zero-sum games. In the opposite direction, Markov games where every state-game is a potential game are not necessarily MPGs. Nevertheless, MPGs showcase standard desirable properties such as the existence of deterministic Nash policies. In our main technical result, we prove fast convergence of independent policy gradient to Nash policies by adapting recent gradient dominance property arguments developed for single agent MDPs to multi-agent learning settings.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Approach to $k$-means</title>

Abstract: \kmeans clustering is a fundamental problem in many scientific and engineering domains. The optimization problem associated with \kmeans clustering is nonconvex, for which standard algorithms are only guaranteed to find a local optimum. Leveraging the hidden structure of local solutions, we propose a general algorithmic framework for escaping undesirable local solutions and recovering the global solution or the ground truth clustering. This framework consists of iteratively alternating between two steps: (i) detect mis-specified clusters in a local solution, and (ii) improve the local solution by non-local operations. We discuss specific implementation of these steps, and elucidate how the proposed framework unifies many existing variants of \kmeans algorithms through a geometric perspective. We also present two natural variants of the proposed framework, where the initial number of clusters may be over- or under-specified. We provide theoretical justifications and extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Packed-Ensembles for Efficient Uncertainty Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09184v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Ensembles (DE) are a prominent approach for achieving excellent performance on key metrics such as accuracy, calibration, uncertainty estimation, and out-of-distribution detection. However, hardware limitations of real-world systems constrain to smaller ensembles and lower-capacity networks, significantly deteriorating their performance and properties. We introduce Packed-Ensembles (PE), a strategy to design and train lightweight structured ensembles by carefully modulating the dimension of their encoding space. We leverage grouped convolutions to parallelize the ensemble into a single shared backbone and forward pass to improve training and inference speeds. PE is designed to operate within the memory limits of a standard neural network. Our extensive research indicates that PE accurately preserves the properties of DE, such as diversity, and performs equally well in terms of accuracy, calibration, out-of-distribution detection, and robustness to distribution shift. We make our code available at https://github.com/ENSTA-U2IS/torch-uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Is Pre-training Truly Better Than Meta-Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of few-shot learning, it is currently believed that a fixed pre-trained (PT) model, along with fine-tuning the final layer during evaluation, outperforms standard meta-learning algorithms. We re-evaluate these claims under an in-depth empirical examination of an extensive set of formally diverse datasets and compare PT to Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Unlike previous work, we emphasize a fair comparison by using: the same architecture, the same optimizer, and all models trained to convergence. Crucially, we use a more rigorous statistical tool -- the effect size (Cohen's d) -- to determine the practical significance of the difference between a model trained with PT vs. a MAML. We then use a previously proposed metric -- the diversity coefficient -- to compute the average formal diversity of a dataset. Using this analysis, we demonstrate the following: 1. when the formal diversity of a data set is low, PT beats MAML on average and 2. when the formal diversity is high, MAML beats PT on average. The caveat is that the magnitude of the average difference between a PT vs. MAML using the effect size is low (according to classical statistical thresholds) -- less than 0.2. Nevertheless, this observation is contrary to the currently held belief that a pre-trained model is always better than a meta-learning model. Our extensive experiments consider 21 few-shot learning benchmarks, including the large-scale few-shot learning dataset Meta-Data set. We also show no significant difference between a MAML model vs. a PT model with GPT-2 on Openwebtext. We, therefore, conclude that a pre-trained model does not always beat a meta-learned model and that the formal diversity of a dataset is a driving factor.</description>

      <title>"What is Different Between These Datasets?" A Framework for Explaining Data Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of machine learning models relies heavily on the quality of input data, yet real-world applications often face significant data-related challenges. A common issue arises when curating training data or deploying models: two datasets from the same domain may exhibit differing distributions. While many techniques exist for detecting such distribution shifts, there is a lack of comprehensive methods to explain these differences in a human-understandable way beyond opaque quantitative metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a versatile framework of interpretable methods for comparing datasets. Using a variety of case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across diverse data modalities-including tabular data, text data, images, time-series signals -- in both low and high-dimensional settings. These methods complement existing techniques by providing actionable and interpretable insights to better understand and address distribution shifts.</description>

      <title>Online Regularized Statistical Learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space With Non-Stationary Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03211v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the convergence of recursive regularized learning algorithms in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with dependent and non-stationary online data streams. Firstly, we introduce the concept of random Tikhonov regularization path and decompose the tracking error of the algorithm's output for the regularization path into random difference equations in RKHS, whose non-homogeneous terms are martingale difference sequences. Investigating the mean square asymptotic stability of the equations, we show that if the regularization path is slowly time-varying, then the algorithm's output achieves mean square consistency with the regularization path. Leveraging operator theory, particularly the monotonicity of the inverses of operators and the spectral decomposition of compact operators, we introduce the RKHS persistence of excitation condition (i.e. there exists a fixed-length time period, such that the conditional expectation of the operators induced by the input data accumulated over every period has a uniformly strictly positive compact lower bound) and develop a dominated convergence method to prove the mean square consistency between the algorithm's output and an unknown function. Finally, for independent and non-identically distributed data streams, the algorithm achieves the mean square consistency if the input data's marginal probability measures are slowly time-varying and the average measure over each fixed-length time period has a uniformly strictly positive lower bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15310v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linearization of attention using various kernel approximation and kernel learning techniques has shown promise. Past methods used a subset of combinations of component functions and weight matrices within the random feature paradigm. We identify the need for a systematic comparison of different combinations of weight matrices and component functions for attention learning in Transformer. Hence, we introduce Spectraformer, a unified framework for approximating and learning the kernel function in the attention mechanism of the Transformer. Our empirical results demonstrate, for the first time, that a random feature-based approach can achieve performance comparable to top-performing sparse and low-rank methods on the challenging Long Range Arena benchmark. Thus, we establish a new state-of-the-art for random feature-based efficient Transformers. The framework also produces many variants that offer different advantages in accuracy, training time, and memory consumption.

      <title>TIDMAD: Time Series Dataset for Discovering Dark Matter with AI Denoising</title>

Abstract: Dark matter makes up approximately 85% of total matter in our universe, yet it has never been directly observed in any laboratory on Earth. The origin of dark matter is one of the most important questions in contemporary physics, and a convincing detection of dark matter would be a Nobel-Prize-level breakthrough in fundamental science. The ABRACADABRA experiment was specifically designed to search for dark matter. Although it has not yet made a discovery, ABRACADABRA has produced several dark matter search results widely endorsed by the physics community. The experiment generates ultra-long time-series data at a rate of 10 million samples per second, where the dark matter signal would manifest itself as a sinusoidal oscillation mode within the ultra-long time series. In this paper, we present the TIDMAD -- a comprehensive data release from the ABRACADABRA experiment including three key components: an ultra-long time series dataset divided into training, validation, and science subsets; a carefully-designed denoising score for direct model benchmarking; and a complete analysis framework which produces a community-standard dark matter search result suitable for publication as a physics paper. This data release enables core AI algorithms to extract the signal and produce real physics results thereby advancing fundamental science. The data downloading and associated analysis scripts are available at https://github.com/jessicafry/TIDMAD</description>

      <title>Sum-of-norms regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When applying nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), the rank parameter is generally unknown. This rank, called the nonnegative rank, is usually estimated heuristically since computing its exact value is NP-hard. In this work, we propose an approximation method to estimate the rank on-the-fly while solving NMF. We use the sum-of-norm (SON), a group-lasso structure that encourages pairwise sim- ilarity, to reduce the rank of a factor matrix when the initial rank is overestimated. On various datasets, SON-NMF can reveal the correct nonnegative rank of the data without prior knowledge or parameter tuning. SON-NMF is a nonconvex, nonsmooth, non-separable, and non-proximable problem, making it nontrivial to solve. First, since rank estimation in NMF is NP-hard, the proposed approach does not benefit from lower computational com- plexity. Using a graph-theoretic argument, we prove that the complexity of SON- NMF is essentially irreducible. Second, the per-iteration cost of algorithms for SON-NMF can be high. This motivates us to propose a first-order BCD algorithm that approximately solves SON-NMF with low per-iteration cost via the proximal average operator. SON-NMF exhibits favorable features for applications. Besides the ability to automatically estimate the rank from data, SON-NMF can handle rank-deficient data matrices and detect weak components with small energy. Furthermore, in hyperspectral imaging, SON-NMF naturally addresses the issue of spectral variability.</description>

      <title>DOTA: Distributional Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language foundation models (VLMs), such as CLIP, exhibit remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models can be unreliable when significant distribution gaps exist between training and test data, while fine-tuning for diverse scenarios is often costly. Cache-based test-time adapters offer an efficient alternative by storing representative test samples to guide subsequent classifications. Yet, these methods typically employ naive cache management with limited capacity, leading to severe catastrophic forgetting when samples are inevitably dropped during updates. In this paper, we propose DOTA (DistributiOnal Test-time Adaptation), a simple yet effective method addressing this limitation. Crucially, instead of merely memorizing individual test samples, DOTA continuously estimates the underlying distribution of the test data stream. Test-time posterior probabilities are then computed using these dynamically estimated distributions via Bayes' theorem for adaptation. This distribution-centric approach enables the model to continually learn and adapt to the deployment environment. Extensive experiments validate that DOTA significantly mitigates forgetting and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>A Generative Framework for Probabilistic, Spatiotemporally Coherent Downscaling of Climate Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15361v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local climate information is crucial for impact assessment and decision-making, yet coarse global climate simulations cannot capture small-scale phenomena. Current statistical downscaling methods infer these phenomena as temporally decoupled spatial patches. However, to preserve physical properties, estimating spatio-temporally coherent high-resolution weather dynamics for multiple variables across long time horizons is crucial. We present a novel generative framework that uses a score-based diffusion model trained on high-resolution reanalysis data to capture the statistical properties of local weather dynamics. After training, we condition on coarse climate model data to generate weather patterns consistent with the aggregate information. As this predictive task is inherently uncertain, we leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models and sample multiple trajectories. We evaluate our approach with high-resolution reanalysis information before applying it to the climate model downscaling task. We then demonstrate that the model generates spatially and temporally coherent weather dynamics that align with global climate output.</description>

      <title>Dynami-CAL GraphNet: A Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network Conserving Linear and Angular Momentum for Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for predicting behaviors and inferring physical properties in natural and engineered environments. Traditional physics-based models face scalability challenges and are computationally demanding, while data-driven approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often lack physical consistency, interpretability, and generalization. In this paper, we propose Dynami-CAL GraphNet, a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network that integrates the learning capabilities of GNNs with physics-based inductive biases to address these limitations. Dynami-CAL GraphNet enforces pairwise conservation of linear and angular momentum for interacting nodes using edge-local reference frames that are equivariant to rotational symmetries, invariant to translations, and equivariant to node permutations. This design ensures physically consistent predictions of node dynamics while offering interpretable, edge-wise linear and angular impulses resulting from pairwise interactions. Evaluated on a 3D granular system with inelastic collisions, Dynami-CAL GraphNet demonstrates stable error accumulation over extended rollouts, effective extrapolations to unseen configurations, and robust handling of heterogeneous interactions and external forces. Dynami-CAL GraphNet offers significant advantages in fields requiring accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of complex multi-body dynamical systems, such as robotics, aerospace engineering, and materials science. By providing physically consistent and scalable predictions that adhere to fundamental conservation laws, it enables the inference of forces and moments while efficiently handling heterogeneous interactions and external forces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer a model to explain its behaviors. While recent studies have focused on the static mechanism of a certain behavior, the learning dynamics inside a model remain to be explored. In this work, we develop a fine-tuning method for analyzing the mechanism behind learning. Inspired by the concept of intrinsic dimension, we view a model as a computational graph with redundancy for a specific task, and treat the fine-tuning process as a search for and optimization of a subgraph within this graph. Based on this hypothesis, we propose circuit-tuning, an algorithm that iteratively builds the subgraph for a specific task and updates the relevant parameters in a heuristic way. We first validate our hypothesis through a carefully designed experiment and provide a detailed analysis of the learning dynamics during fine-tuning. Subsequently, we conduct experiments on more complex tasks, demonstrating that circuit-tuning could strike a balance between the performance on the target task and the general capabilities. Our work offers a new analytical method for the dynamics of fine-tuning, provides new findings on the mechanisms behind the training process, and inspires the design of superior algorithms for the training of neural networks.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Self-Supervised Framework for Long-Sequence EEG Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals generally exhibit low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and high inter-subject variability, making generalization across subjects and domains challenging. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly self-supervised learning with Transformer-based architectures, have shown promise in EEG representation learning. However, their quadratic computational complexity increases memory usage and slows inference, making them inefficient for modeling long-range dependencies. Moreover, most existing approaches emphasize either explicit window segmentation of the temporal signal or spectral-only input embedding while neglecting raw temporal dynamics. In this paper, we propose EEGM2, a self-supervised framework that overcomes these limitations. EEGM2 adopts a U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture integrated with Mamba-2 to achieve linear computational complexity, thereby reducing memory usage and improving inference speed. Meanwhile, the selective information propagation mechanism of Mamba-2 enables the model to effectively capture and preserve long-range dependencies in raw EEG signals, where traditional RNN or CNN architectures often struggle. Moreover, EEGM2 employs a self-supervised pre-training objective that reconstructs raw EEG using a combined L1 and spectral (Fourier-based) loss, enhancing generalization by jointly preserving temporal dynamics and spectral characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that EEGM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-sequence modeling and classification. Further evaluations show that EEGM2 consistently outperforms existing models, demonstrating strong generalization across subjects and tasks, as well as transferability across domains. Overall, EEGM2 offers an efficient and scalable solution suitable for deployment on resource-constrained brain-computer interface (BCI) devices.</description>

      <title>Union of Experts: Adapting Hierarchical Routing to Equivalently Decomposed Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enhances model performance while maintaining computational efficiency, making it well-suited for large-scale applications. Conventional mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures suffer from suboptimal coordination dynamics, where isolated expert operations expose the model to overfitting risks. Moreover, they have not been effectively extended to attention blocks, which limits further efficiency improvements. To tackle these issues, we propose Union-of-Experts (UoE), which decomposes the transformer model into an equivalent group of experts and applies a hierarchical routing mechanism to allocate input subspaces to specialized experts. Our approach advances MoE design with four key innovations: (1) Constructing expert groups by partitioning non-MoE models into functionally equivalent specialists (2) Developing a hierarchical routing paradigm that integrates patch-wise data selection and expert selection strategies. (3) Extending the MoE design to attention blocks. (4) Proposing a hardware-optimized parallelization scheme that exploits batched matrix multiplications for efficient expert computation. The experiments demonstrate that our UoE model surpasses Full Attention, state-of-the-art MoEs and efficient transformers in several tasks across image and natural language domains. In language modeling tasks, UoE achieves an average reduction of 2.38 in perplexity compared to the best-performing MoE method with only 76% of its FLOPs. In the Long Range Arena benchmark, it demonstrates an average score at least 0.68% higher than all comparison models, with only 50% of the FLOPs of the best MoE method. In image classification, it yields an average accuracy improvement of 1.75% over the best model while maintaining comparable FLOPs.

      <title>A Survey on Sparse Autoencoders: Interpreting the Internal Mechanisms of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. Recently, mechanistic interpretability has attracted significant attention from the research community as a means to understand the inner workings of LLMs. Among various mechanistic interpretability approaches, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising method due to their ability to disentangle the complex, superimposed features within LLMs into more interpretable components. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of SAEs for interpreting and understanding the internal workings of LLMs. Our major contributions include: (1) exploring the technical framework of SAEs, covering basic architecture, design improvements, and effective training strategies; (2) examining different approaches to explaining SAE features, categorized into input-based and output-based explanation methods; (3) discussing evaluation methods for assessing SAE performance, covering both structural and functional metrics; and (4) investigating real-world applications of SAEs in understanding and manipulating LLM behaviors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laplacian-based methods are popular for the dimensionality reduction of data lying in $\mathbb{R}^N$. Several theoretical results for these algorithms depend on the fact that the Euclidean distance locally approximates the geodesic distance on the underlying submanifold which the data are assumed to lie on. However, for some applications, other metrics, such as the Wasserstein distance, may provide a more appropriate notion of distance than the Euclidean distance. We provide a framework that generalizes the problem of manifold learning to metric spaces and study when a metric satisfies sufficient conditions for the pointwise convergence of the graph Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Disentangle and Regularize: Sign Language Production with Articulator-Based Disentanglement and Channel-Aware Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose DARSLP, a simple gloss-free, transformer-based sign language production (SLP) framework that directly maps spoken-language text to sign pose sequences. We first train a pose autoencoder that encodes sign poses into a compact latent space using an articulator-based disentanglement strategy, where features corresponding to the face, right hand, left hand, and body are modeled separately to promote structured and interpretable representation learning. Next, a non-autoregressive transformer decoder is trained to predict these latent representations from word-level text embeddings of the input sentence. To guide this process, we apply channel-aware regularization by aligning predicted latent distributions with priors extracted from the ground-truth encodings using a KL divergence loss. The contribution of each channel to the loss is weighted according to its associated articulator region, enabling the model to account for the relative importance of different articulators during training. Our approach does not rely on gloss supervision or pretrained models, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily datasets.</description>

      <title>Scaling Up On-Device LLMs via Active-Weight Swapping Between DRAM and Flash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed on mobile devices, but the limited DRAM capacity constrains the deployable model size. This paper introduces ActiveFlow, the first LLM inference framework that can achieve adaptive DRAM usage for modern LLMs (not ReLU-based), enabling the scaling up of deployable model sizes. The framework is based on the novel concept of active weight DRAM-flash swapping and incorporates three novel techniques: (1) Cross-layer active weights preloading. It uses the activations from the current layer to predict the active weights of several subsequent layers, enabling computation and data loading to overlap, as well as facilitating large I/O transfers. (2) Sparsity-aware self-distillation. It adjusts the active weights to align with the dense-model output distribution, compensating for approximations introduced by contextual sparsity. (3) Active weight DRAM-flash swapping pipeline. It orchestrates the DRAM space allocation among the hot weight cache, preloaded active weights, and computation-involved weights based on available memory. Results show ActiveFlow achieves the performance-cost Pareto frontier compared to existing efficiency optimization methods.</description>

      <title>ABG-NAS: Adaptive Bayesian Genetic Neural Architecture Search for Graph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective and efficient graph representation learning is essential for enabling critical downstream tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and subgraph search. However, existing graph neural network (GNN) architectures often struggle to adapt to diverse and complex graph structures, limiting their ability to produce structure-aware and task-discriminative representations. To address this challenge, we propose ABG-NAS, a novel framework for automated graph neural network architecture search tailored for efficient graph representation learning. ABG-NAS encompasses three key components: a Comprehensive Architecture Search Space (CASS), an Adaptive Genetic Optimization Strategy (AGOS), and a Bayesian-Guided Tuning Module (BGTM). CASS systematically explores diverse propagation (P) and transformation (T) operations, enabling the discovery of GNN architectures capable of capturing intricate graph characteristics. AGOS dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring search efficiency and preserving solution diversity. BGTM further optimizes hyperparameters periodically, enhancing the scalability and robustness of the resulting architectures. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets (Cora, PubMed, Citeseer, and CoraFull) demonstrate that ABG-NAS consistently outperforms both manually designed GNNs and state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods. These results highlight the potential of ABG-NAS to advance graph representation learning by providing scalable and adaptive solutions for diverse graph structures. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/sserranw/ABG-NAS.</description>

      <title>Connecting Independently Trained Modes via Layer-Wise Connectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02604v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical and theoretical studies have shown that continuous low-loss paths can be constructed between independently trained neural network models. This phenomenon, known as mode connectivity, refers to the existence of such paths between distinct modes-i.e., well-trained solutions in parameter space. However, existing empirical methods are primarily effective for older and relatively simple architectures such as basic CNNs, VGG, and ResNet, raising concerns about their applicability to modern and structurally diverse models. In this work, we propose a new empirical algorithm for connecting independently trained modes that generalizes beyond traditional architectures and supports a broader range of networks, including MobileNet, ShuffleNet, EfficientNet, RegNet, Deep Layer Aggregation (DLA), and Compact Convolutional Transformers (CCT). In addition to broader applicability, the proposed method yields more consistent connectivity paths across independently trained mode pairs and supports connecting modes obtained with different training hyperparameters.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Low-Rank Compression of Neural Networks with Robustness under Adversarial Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deployment of neural networks on resource-constrained devices demands models that are both compact and robust to adversarial inputs. However, compression and adversarial robustness often conflict. In this work, we introduce a dynamical low-rank training scheme enhanced with a novel spectral regularizer that controls the condition number of the low-rank core in each layer. This approach mitigates the sensitivity of compressed models to adversarial perturbations without sacrificing accuracy on clean data. The method is model- and data-agnostic, computationally efficient, and supports rank adaptivity to automatically compress the network at hand. Extensive experiments across standard architectures, datasets, and adversarial attacks show the regularized networks can achieve over 94% compression while recovering or improving adversarial accuracy relative to uncompressed baselines.</description>

      <title>Beyond Input Activations: Identifying Influential Latents by Gradient Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for interpreting and steering the internal representations of large language models (LLMs). However, conventional approaches to analyzing SAEs typically rely solely on input-side activations, without considering the causal influence between each latent feature and the model's output. This work is built on two key hypotheses: (1) activated latents do not contribute equally to the construction of the model's output, and (2) only latents with high causal influence are effective for model steering. To validate these hypotheses, we propose Gradient Sparse Autoencoder (GradSAE), a simple yet effective method that identifies the most influential latents by incorporating output-side gradient information.</description>

      <title>msf-CNN: Patch-based Multi-Stage Fusion with Convolutional Neural Networks for TinyML</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI spans from large language models to tiny models running on microcontrollers (MCUs). Extremely memory-efficient model architectures are decisive to fit within an MCU's tiny memory budget e.g., 128kB of RAM. However, inference latency must remain small to fit real-time constraints. An approach to tackle this is patch-based fusion, which aims to optimize data flows across neural network layers. In this paper, we introduce msf-CNN, a novel technique that efficiently finds optimal fusion settings for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by walking through the fusion solution space represented as a directed acyclic graph. Compared to previous work on CNN fusion for MCUs, msf-CNN identifies a wider set of solutions. We published an implementation of msf-CNN running on various microcontrollers (ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP32). We show that msf-CNN can achieve inference using 50% less RAM compared to the prior art (MCUNetV2 and StreamNet). We thus demonstrate how msf-CNN offers additional flexibility for system designers.</description>

Abstract: The intensive care unit (ICU) manages critically ill patients, many of whom face a high risk of mortality. Early and accurate prediction of in-hospital mortality within the first 24 hours of ICU admission is crucial for timely clinical interventions, resource optimization, and improved patient outcomes. Traditional scoring systems, while useful, often have limitations in predictive accuracy and adaptability. Objective: This review aims to systematically evaluate and benchmark innovative methodologies that leverage data available within the first day of ICU admission for predicting in-hospital mortality. We focus on advancements in machine learning, novel biomarker applications, and the integration of diverse data types.</description>

      <title>EC-LDA : Label Distribution Inference Attack against Federated Graph Learning with Embedding Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for graph analysis. Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is an emerging learning framework to collaboratively train graph data from various clients. However, since clients are required to upload model parameters to the server in each round, this provides the server with an opportunity to infer each client's data privacy. In this paper, we focus on label distribution attacks(LDAs) that aim to infer the label distributions of the clients' local data. We take the first step to attack client's label distributions in FGL. Firstly, we observe that the effectiveness of LDA is closely related to the variance of node embeddings in GNNs. Next, we analyze the relation between them and we propose a new attack named EC-LDA, which significantly improves the attack effectiveness by compressing node embeddings. Thirdly, extensive experiments on node classification and link prediction tasks across six widely used graph datasets show that EC-LDA outperforms the SOTA LDAs. For example, EC-LDA attains optimal values under both Cos-sim and JS-div evaluation metrics in the CoraFull and LastFM datasets. Finally, we explore the robustness of EC-LDA under differential privacy protection.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a subset from a large action space shared by a family of bandits, with the goal of achieving performance nearly matching that of using the full action space. We assume that similar actions tend to have related payoffs, modeled by a Gaussian process. To exploit this structure, we propose a simple epsilon-net algorithm to select a representative subset. We provide theoretical guarantees for its performance and compare it empirically to Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound.</description>

      <title>Foresight: Adaptive Layer Reuse for Accelerated and High-Quality Text-to-Video Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art results in text-to-image, text-to-video generation, and editing. However, their large model size and the quadratic cost of spatial-temporal attention over multiple denoising steps make video generation computationally expensive. Static caching mitigates this by reusing features across fixed steps but fails to adapt to generation dynamics, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between speed and quality.
  We propose Foresight, an adaptive layer-reuse technique that reduces computational redundancy across denoising steps while preserving baseline performance. Foresight dynamically identifies and reuses DiT block outputs for all layers across steps, adapting to generation parameters such as resolution and denoising schedules to optimize efficiency. Applied to OpenSora, Latte, and CogVideoX, Foresight achieves up to \latencyimprv end-to-end speedup, while maintaining video quality. The source code of Foresight is available at \href{https://github.com/STAR-Laboratory/foresight}{https://github.com/STAR-Laboratory/foresight}.</description>

      <title>Bayes Error Rate Estimation in Difficult Situations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bayes Error Rate (BER) is the fundamental limit on the achievable generalizable classification accuracy of any machine learning model due to inherent uncertainty within the data. BER estimators offer insight into the difficulty of any classification problem and set expectations for optimal classification performance. In order to be useful, the estimators must also be accurate with a limited number of samples on multivariate problems with unknown class distributions. To determine which estimators meet the minimum requirements for "usefulness", an in-depth examination of their accuracy is conducted using Monte Carlo simulations with synthetic data in order to obtain their confidence bounds for binary classification. To examine the usability of the estimators for real-world applications, new non-linear multi-modal test scenarios are introduced. In each scenario, 2500 Monte Carlo simulations per scenario are run over a wide range of BER values. In a comparison of k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Generalized Henze-Penrose (GHP) divergence and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques, results show that kNN is overwhelmingly the more accurate non-parametric estimator. In order to reach the target of an under 5% range for the 95% confidence bounds, the minimum number of required samples per class is 1000. As more features are added, more samples are needed, so that 2500 samples per class are required at only 4 features. Other estimators do become more accurate than kNN as more features are added, but continuously fail to meet the target range.</description>

Abstract: Dysplasia is a recognised risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip, early diagnosis of dysplasia is important to provide opportunities for surgical interventions aimed at reducing the risk of hip OA. We have developed a pipeline for semi-automated classification of dysplasia using volumetric CT scans of patients' hips and a minimal set of clinically annotated landmarks, combining the framework of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, which we termed the Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM). We used 192 CT scans, 100 for model training and 92 for testing. The GPDSSM effectively distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls while also highlighting regions of the underlying surface that show dysplastic variations. As well as improving classification accuracy compared to angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%), the GPDSSM can save time for clinicians by removing the need to manually measure angles and interpreting 2D scans for possible markers of dysplasia.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Mixture of Progressive Parameter-Efficient Expert Library for Lifelong Robot Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalist agent must continuously learn and adapt throughout its lifetime, achieving efficient forward transfer while minimizing catastrophic forgetting. Previous work within the dominant pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has explored parameter-efficient fine-tuning for single-task adaptation, effectively steering a frozen pretrained model with a small number of parameters. However, in the context of lifelong learning, these methods rely on the impractical assumption of a test-time task identifier and restrict knowledge sharing among isolated adapters. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Mixture of Progressive Parameter-Efficient Expert Library (DMPEL) for lifelong robot learning. DMPEL progressively builds a low-rank expert library and employs a lightweight router to dynamically combine experts into an end-to-end policy, enabling flexible and efficient lifelong forward transfer. Furthermore, by leveraging the modular structure of the fine-tuned parameters, we introduce expert coefficient replay, which guides the router to accurately retrieve frozen experts for previously encountered tasks. This technique mitigates forgetting while being significantly more storage- and computation-efficient than experience replay over the entire policy. Extensive experiments on the lifelong robot learning benchmark LIBERO demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods in success rates during continual adaptation, while utilizing minimal trainable parameters and storage.</description>

      <title>Athena: Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning with Data-efficient Process Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems. Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data, we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios: verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios. Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score, showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with a significant margin on five benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Rigorous Behavior Assessment of CNNs Using a Data-Domain Sampling Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a data-domain sampling regime for quantifying CNNs' graphic perception behaviors. This regime lets us evaluate CNNs' ratio estimation ability in bar charts from three perspectives: sensitivity to training-test distribution discrepancies, stability to limited samples, and relative expertise to human observers. After analyzing 16 million trials from 800 CNNs models and 6,825 trials from 113 human participants, we arrived at a simple and actionable conclusion: CNNs can outperform humans and their biases simply depend on the training-test distance. We show evidence of this simple, elegant behavior of the machines when they interpret visualization images. osf.io/gfqc3 provides registration, the code for our sampling regime, and experimental results.</description>

      <title>Class-wise Balancing Data Replay for Federated Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks. However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks, yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>HyperEvent: A Strong Baseline for Dynamic Link Prediction via Relative Structural Encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning representations for continuous-time dynamic graphs is critical for dynamic link prediction. While recent methods have become increasingly complex, the field lacks a strong and informative baseline to reliably gauge progress. This paper proposes HyperEvent, a simple approach that captures relative structural patterns in event sequences through an intuitive encoding mechanism. As a straightforward baseline, HyperEvent leverages relative structural encoding to identify meaningful event sequences without complex parameterization. By combining these interpretable features with a lightweight transformer classifier, HyperEvent reframes link prediction as event structure recognition. Despite its simplicity, HyperEvent achieves competitive results across multiple benchmarks, often matching the performance of more complex models. This work demonstrates that effective modeling can be achieved through simple structural encoding, providing a clear reference point for evaluating future advancements.</description>

      <title>PIGDreamer: Privileged Information Guided World Models for Safe Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial observability presents a significant challenge for Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL), as it impedes the identification of potential risks and rewards. Leveraging specific types of privileged information during training to mitigate the effects of partial observability has yielded notable empirical successes. In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs) to theoretically examine the advantages of incorporating privileged information in Safe RL. Building upon ACPOMDPs, we propose the Privileged Information Guided Dreamer (PIGDreamer), a model-based RL approach that leverages privileged information to enhance the agent's safety and performance through privileged representation alignment and an asymmetric actor-critic structure. Our empirical results demonstrate that PIGDreamer significantly outperforms existing Safe RL methods. Furthermore, compared to alternative privileged RL methods, our approach exhibits enhanced performance, robustness, and efficiency. Codes are available at: https://github.com/hggforget/PIGDreamer.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular representation learning have produced highly effective encodings of molecules for numerous cheminformatics and bioinformatics tasks. However, extracting general chemical insight while balancing predictive accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture that combines compressed higher-order topological signals with standard molecular features. Our approach captures global geometric information while preserving computational tractability and human-interpretable structure. We evaluate our model across a range of benchmarks, from small-molecule datasets to complex material datasets, and demonstrate superior performance using a parameter-efficient architecture. We achieve the best performing results in both accuracy and robustness across almost all benchmarks. We open source all code \footnote{All code and results can be found on Github https://github.com/rahulkhorana/TFC-PACT-Net}.</description>

      <title>EvoCoT: Overcoming the Exploration Bottleneck in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07809v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) has become a promising paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve their reasoning capability. However, when the rollout accuracy is low on hard problems, the reward becomes sparse, limiting learning efficiency and causing exploration bottlenecks. Existing approaches either rely on teacher models for distillation or filter out difficult problems, which limits scalability or restricts reasoning improvement through exploration.
  We propose EvoCoT, a self-evolving curriculum learning framework based on two-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning optimization. EvoCoT constrains the exploration space by self-generating and verifying CoT trajectories, then gradually shortens CoT steps to expand the space in a controlled way. The framework enables LLMs to stably learn from initially unsolved hard problems under sparse rewards. We apply EvoCoT to multiple LLM families, including Qwen, DeepSeek, and Llama. Experiments show that EvoCoT enables LLMs to solve previously unsolved problems, improves reasoning capability without external CoT supervision, and is compatible with various RL fine-tuning methods. We release the source code to support future research.</description>

Abstract: Realizing personalized medicine at scale calls for methods that distill insights from longitudinal patient journeys, which can be viewed as a sequence of medical events. Foundation models pretrained on large-scale medical event data represent a promising direction for scaling real-world evidence generation and generalizing to diverse downstream tasks. Using Epic Cosmos, a dataset with medical events from de-identified longitudinal health records for 16.3 billion encounters over 300 million unique patient records from 310 health systems, we introduce the Comet models, a family of decoder-only transformer models pretrained on 118 million patients representing 115 billion discrete medical events (151 billion tokens). We present the largest scaling-law study of medical event data, establishing a methodology for pretraining and revealing power-law scaling relationships for compute, tokens, and model size. Consequently, we pretrained a series of compute-optimal models with up to 1 billion parameters. Conditioned on a patient's real-world history, Comet autoregressively predicts the next medical event to simulate patient health timelines. We studied 78 real-world tasks, including diagnosis prediction, disease prognosis, and healthcare operations. Remarkably for a foundation model with generic pretraining and simulation-based inference, Comet generally outperformed or matched task-specific supervised models on these tasks, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning or few-shot examples. Comet's predictive power consistently improves as the model and pretraining scale. Our results show that Comet, a generative medical event foundation model, can effectively capture complex clinical dynamics, providing an extensible and generalizable framework to support clinical decision-making, streamline healthcare operations, and improve patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Evaluation Function: A Multi-Metric Approach for Optimizing Demand Forecasting Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13057v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for effective inventory management in dynamic and competitive environments, where decisions are influenced by uncertainty, financial constraints, and logistical limitations. Traditional evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) provide complementary perspectives but may lead to biased assessments when applied individually. To address this limitation, we propose the Hierarchical Evaluation Function (HEF), a composite function that integrates R2, MAE, and RMSE within a hierarchical and adaptive framework. The function incorporates dynamic weights, tolerance thresholds derived from the statistical properties of the series, and progressive penalty mechanisms to ensure robustness against extreme errors and invalid predictions. HEF was implemented to optimize multiple forecasting models using Grid Search, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Optuna, and tested on benchmark datasets including Walmart, M3, M4, and M5. Experimental results, validated through statistical tests, demonstrate that HEF consistently outperforms MAE as an evaluation function in global metrics such as R2, Global Relative Accuracy (GRA), RMSE, and RMSSE, thereby providing greater explanatory power, adaptability, and stability. While MAE retains advantages in simplicity and efficiency, HEF proves more effective for long-term planning and complex contexts. Overall, HEF constitutes a robust and adaptive alternative for model selection and hyperparameter optimization in highly variable demand forecasting environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid scaling of deep learning models has enabled performance gains across domains, yet it introduced several challenges. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of federated learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16313v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors, particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for enhancing multimodal reasoning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of immersive Metaverse applications introduces complex challenges at the intersection of performance, privacy, and environmental sustainability. Centralized architectures fall short in addressing these demands, often resulting in elevated energy consumption, latency, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes MetaFed, a decentralized federated learning (FL) framework that enables sustainable and intelligent resource orchestration for Metaverse environments. MetaFed integrates (i) multi-agent reinforcement learning for dynamic client selection, (ii) privacy-preserving FL using homomorphic encryption, and (iii) carbon-aware scheduling aligned with renewable energy availability. Evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 using lightweight ResNet architectures demonstrate that MetaFed achieves up to 25% reduction in carbon emissions compared to conventional approaches, while maintaining high accuracy and minimal communication overhead. These results highlight MetaFed as a scalable solution for building environmentally responsible and privacy-compliant Metaverse infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Unlearning as Ablation: Toward a Falsifiable Benchmark for Generative Scientific Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bold claims about AI's role in science-from "AGI will cure all diseases" to promises of radically accelerated discovery-raise a central epistemic question: do large language models (LLMs) truly generate new knowledge, or do they merely remix memorized fragments? We propose unlearning-as-ablation as a falsifiable probe of constructive scientific discovery. The idea is to systematically remove a target result together with its forget-closure (supporting lemmas, paraphrases, and multi-hop entailments) and then evaluate whether the model can re-derive the result from only permitted axioms and tools. Success would indicate generative capability beyond recall; failure would expose current limits. Unlike prevailing motivations for unlearning-privacy, copyright, or safety-our framing repositions it as an epistemic probe for AI-for-Science. We outline a minimal pilot in mathematics and algorithms to illustrate feasibility, and sketch how the same approach could later be extended to domains such as physics or chemistry. This is a position paper: our contribution is conceptual and methodological, not empirical. We aim to stimulate discussion on how principled ablation tests could help distinguish models that reconstruct knowledge from those that merely retrieve it, and how such probes might guide the next generation of AI-for-Science benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: Graphs are central to the chemical sciences, providing a natural language to describe molecules, proteins, reactions, and industrial processes. They capture interactions and structures that underpin materials, biology, and medicine. This primer, Graph Data Modeling: Molecules, Proteins, &amp; Chemical Processes, introduces graphs as mathematical objects in chemistry and shows how learning algorithms (particularly graph neural networks) can operate on them. We outline the foundations of graph design, key prediction tasks, representative examples across chemical sciences, and the role of machine learning in graph-based modeling. Together, these concepts prepare readers to apply graph methods to the next generation of chemical discovery.</description>

      <title>Turning Tabular Foundation Models into Graph Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language processing and computer vision, their potential in graph machine learning remains largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that can vary across different graph datasets. While many works on GFMs have focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed. However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the recent success of tabular foundation models (TFMs) like TabPFNv2 or LimiX, we propose G2T-FM, a simple framework for turning tabular foundation models into graph foundation models. Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies a TFM to the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available GFMs and performing competitively with, and often better than, well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover, after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines. In particular, when combined with LimiX, G2T-FM often outperforms the best GNN by a significant margin. In summary, our paper reveals the potential of a previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for graph machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>The Transparent Earth: A Multimodal Foundation Model for the Earth's Subsurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Transparent Earth, a transformer-based architecture for reconstructing subsurface properties from heterogeneous datasets that vary in sparsity, resolution, and modality, where each modality represents a distinct type of observation (e.g., stress angle, mantle temperature, tectonic plate type). The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on Earth.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning. Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range interactions are captured through a flexible spectral-domain parameterization. This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.</description>

      <title>FediLoRA: Heterogeneous LoRA for Federated Multimodal Fine-tuning under Missing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet their large parameter sizes pose challenges for practical deployment, especially in decentralized environments. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces local computing and memory overhead, making it attractive for federated learning. However, existing federated LoRA methods typically assume uniform rank configurations and unimodal inputs, overlooking two key real-world challenges: (1) heterogeneous client resources have different LoRA ranks, and (2) multimodal data settings with potentially missing modalities. In this work, we propose FediLoRA, a simple yet effective framework for federated multimodal fine-tuning under heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities. FediLoRA introduces a dimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without information dilution during aggregation. It also includes a lightweight layer-wise model editing method that selectively incorporates global parameters to repair local components which improves both client and global model performances. Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets demonstrate that FediLoRA achieves superior performance over competitive baselines in both global and personalized settings, particularly in the presence of modality incompleteness.</description>

      <title>The CRITICAL Records Integrated Standardization Pipeline (CRISP): End-to-End Processing of Large-scale Multi-institutional OMOP CDM Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While existing critical care EHR datasets such as MIMIC and eICU have enabled significant advances in clinical AI research, the CRITICAL dataset opens new frontiers by providing extensive scale and diversity -- containing 1.95 billion records from 371,365 patients across four geographically diverse CTSA institutions. CRITICAL's unique strength lies in capturing full-spectrum patient journeys, including pre-ICU, ICU, and post-ICU encounters across both inpatient and outpatient settings. This multi-institutional, longitudinal perspective creates transformative opportunities for developing generalizable predictive models and advancing health equity research. However, the richness of this multi-site resource introduces substantial complexity in data harmonization, with heterogeneous collection practices and diverse vocabulary usage patterns requiring sophisticated preprocessing approaches.
  We present CRISP to unlock the full potential of this valuable resource. CRISP systematically transforms raw Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model data into ML-ready datasets through: (1) transparent data quality management with comprehensive audit trails, (2) cross-vocabulary mapping of heterogeneous medical terminologies to unified SNOMED-CT standards, with deduplication and unit standardization, (3) modular architecture with parallel optimization enabling complete dataset processing in $&lt;$1 day even on standard computing hardware, and (4) comprehensive baseline model benchmarks spanning multiple clinical prediction tasks to establish reproducible performance standards. By providing processing pipeline, baseline implementations, and detailed transformation documentation, CRISP saves researchers months of preprocessing effort and democratizes access to large-scale multi-institutional critical care data, enabling them to focus on advancing clinical AI.</description>

      <title>Clip Your Sequences Fairly: Enforcing Length Fairness for Sequence-Level RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping on the importance-sampling (IS) weight. We study RL methods with sequence-level IS and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short vs.\ long responses, distorting the optimization direction. FSPO introduces a simple remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a cosine directional guarantee between the clipped and true updates. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation datasets on Qwen3-8B-Base model.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Feedforward Networks for Probabilistic Finite Automata: Exact Simulation and Learnability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a formal and constructive theory showing that probabilistic finite automata (PFAs) can be exactly simulated using symbolic feedforward neural networks. Our architecture represents state distributions as vectors and transitions as stochastic matrices, enabling probabilistic state propagation via matrix-vector products. This yields a parallel, interpretable, and differentiable simulation of PFA dynamics using soft updates-without recurrence. We formally characterize probabilistic subset construction, $\varepsilon$-closure, and exact simulation via layered symbolic computation, and prove equivalence between PFAs and specific classes of neural networks. We further show that these symbolic simulators are not only expressive but learnable: trained with standard gradient descent-based optimization on labeled sequence data, they recover the exact behavior of ground-truth PFAs. This learnability, formalized in Proposition 5.1, is the crux of this work. Our results unify probabilistic automata theory with neural architectures under a rigorous algebraic framework, bridging the gap between symbolic computation and deep learning.</description>

      <title>ToMA: Token Merge with Attention for Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel in high-fidelity image generation but face scalability limits due to transformers' quadratic attention complexity. Plug-and-play token reduction methods like ToMeSD and ToFu reduce FLOPs by merging redundant tokens in generated images but rely on GPU-inefficient operations (e.g., sorting, scattered writes), introducing overheads that negate theoretical speedups when paired with optimized attention implementations (e.g., FlashAttention). To bridge this gap, we propose Token Merge with Attention (ToMA), an off-the-shelf method that redesigns token reduction for GPU-aligned efficiency, with three key contributions: 1) a reformulation of token merge as a submodular optimization problem to select diverse tokens; 2) merge/unmerge as an attention-like linear transformation via GPU-friendly matrix operations; and 3) exploiting latent locality and sequential redundancy (pattern reuse) to minimize overhead. ToMA reduces SDXL/Flux generation latency by 24%/23%, respectively (with DINO $\Delta &lt; 0.07$), outperforming prior methods. This work bridges the gap between theoretical and practical efficiency for transformers in diffusion.</description>

      <title>FragmentGPT: A Unified GPT Model for Fragment Growing, Linking, and Merging in Molecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fragment-Based Drug Discovery (FBDD) is a popular approach in early drug development, but designing effective linkers to combine disconnected molecular fragments into chemically and pharmacologically viable candidates remains challenging. Further complexity arises when fragments contain structural redundancies, like duplicate rings, which cannot be addressed by simply adding or removing atoms or bonds. To address these challenges in a unified framework, we introduce FragmentGPT, which integrates two core components: (1) a novel chemically-aware, energy-based bond cleavage pre-training strategy that equips the GPT-based model with fragment growing, linking, and merging capabilities, and (2) a novel Reward Ranked Alignment with Expert Exploration (RAE) algorithm that combines expert imitation learning for diversity enhancement, data selection and augmentation for Pareto and composite score optimality, and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to align the learner policy with multi-objective goals. Conditioned on fragment pairs, FragmentGPT generates linkers that connect diverse molecular subunits while simultaneously optimizing for multiple pharmaceutical goals. It also learns to resolve structural redundancies-such as duplicated fragments-through intelligent merging, enabling the synthesis of optimized molecules. FragmentGPT facilitates controlled, goal-driven molecular assembly. Experiments and ablation studies on real-world cancer datasets demonstrate its ability to generate chemically valid, high-quality molecules tailored for downstream drug discovery tasks.</description>

      <title>Single-stream Policy Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit policy-gradient optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) from a single-stream perspective. Prevailing group-based methods like GRPO reduce variance with on-the-fly baselines but suffer from critical flaws: frequent degenerate groups erase learning signals, and synchronization barriers hinder scalability. We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which eliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a persistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across the batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample. Being group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in long-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary. Furthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive curriculum via prioritized sampling. Experiments using Qwen3-8B show that SPO converges more smoothly and attains higher accuracy than GRPO, while eliminating computation wasted on degenerate groups. Ablation studies confirm that SPO's gains stem from its principled approach to baseline estimation and advantage normalization, offering a more robust and efficient path for LLM reasoning. Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the average maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial absolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25, +4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain in pass@$k$ across the evaluated $k$ values. SPO's success challenges the prevailing trend of adding incidental complexity to RL algorithms, highlighting a path where fundamental principles, not architectural workarounds, drive the next wave of progress in LLM reasoning.</description>

      <title>Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL): A Framework for Modeling Complex Predator-Prey Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ecological systems exhibit complex multi-scale dynamics that challenge traditional modeling. New methods must capture temporal oscillations and emergent spatiotemporal patterns while adhering to conservation principles. We present the Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL) framework, a deep learning architecture integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and conservation laws to model predator-prey dynamics across dimensional scales. The framework provides a unified solution for both ordinary (ODE) and partial (PDE) differential equation systems, describing temporal cycles and reaction-diffusion patterns within a single neural network architecture. Our methodology uses automatic differentiation to enforce physics constraints and adaptive loss weighting to balance data fidelity with physical consistency. Applied to the Lotka-Volterra system, USPIL achieves 98.9% correlation for 1D temporal dynamics (loss: 0.0219, MAE: 0.0184) and captures complex spiral waves in 2D systems (loss: 4.7656, pattern correlation: 0.94). Validation confirms conservation law adherence within 0.5% and shows a 10-50x computational speedup for inference compared to numerical solvers. USPIL also enables mechanistic understanding through interpretable physics constraints, facilitating parameter discovery and sensitivity analysis not possible with purely data-driven methods. Its ability to transition between dimensional formulations opens new avenues for multi-scale ecological modeling. These capabilities make USPIL a transformative tool for ecological forecasting, conservation planning, and understanding ecosystem resilience, establishing physics-informed deep learning as a powerful and scientifically rigorous paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly transformed natural language understanding and generation, but they raise privacy concerns due to potential exposure of sensitive information. Studies have highlighted the risk of information leakage, where adversaries can extract sensitive information embedded in the prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel private prediction framework for generating high-quality synthetic text with strong privacy guarantees. Our approach leverages the Differential Privacy (DP) framework to ensure worst-case theoretical bounds on information leakage without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying models. The proposed method performs inference on private records and aggregates the resulting per-token output distributions. This enables the generation of longer and coherent synthetic text while maintaining privacy guarantees. Additionally, we propose a simple blending operation that combines private and public inference to further enhance utility. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on in-context-learning (ICL) tasks, making it a promising direction for privacy-preserving text generation while maintaining high utility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is critical, especially when biases compound across intersecting protected attributes like race, gender, and age. While existing methods address fairness for single attributes, they fail to capture the nuanced, multiplicative biases faced by intersectional subgroups. We introduce Adaptive Pareto Front Explorer (APFEx), the first framework to explicitly model intersectional fairness as a joint optimization problem over the Cartesian product of sensitive attributes. APFEx combines three key innovations- (1) an adaptive multi-objective optimizer that dynamically switches between Pareto cone projection, gradient weighting, and exploration strategies to navigate fairness-accuracy trade-offs, (2) differentiable intersectional fairness metrics enabling gradient-based optimization of non-smooth subgroup disparities, and (3) theoretical guarantees of convergence to Pareto-optimal solutions. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate APFEx's superiority, reducing fairness violations while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our work bridges a critical gap in fair ML, providing a scalable, model-agnostic solution for intersectional fairness.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Federated Learning for Social Network with Mobility</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized solution that allows collaborative local model training and global aggregation, thereby protecting data privacy. In conventional FL frameworks, data privacy is typically preserved under the assumption that local data remains absolutely private, whereas the mobility of clients is frequently neglected in explicit modeling. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical federated learning framework based on the social network with mobility namely HFL-SNM that considers both data sharing among clients and their mobility patterns. Under the constraints of limited resources, we formulate a joint optimization problem of resource allocation and client scheduling, which objective is to minimize the energy consumption of clients during the FL process. In social network, we introduce the concepts of Effective Data Coverage Rate and Redundant Data Coverage Rate. We analyze the impact of effective data and redundant data on the model performance through preliminary experiments. We decouple the optimization problem into multiple sub-problems, analyze them based on preliminary experimental results, and propose Dynamic Optimization in Social Network with Mobility (DO-SNM) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves superior model performance while significantly reducing energy consumption, compared to traditional baseline algorithms.</description>

      <title>Small LLMs with Expert Blocks Are Good Enough for Hyperparamter Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyper-parameter Tuning (HPT) is a necessary step in machine learning (ML) pipelines but becomes computationally expensive and opaque with larger models. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been explored for HPT, yet most rely on models exceeding 100 billion parameters. We propose an Expert Block Framework for HPT using Small LLMs. At its core is the Trajectory Context Summarizer (TCS), a deterministic block that transforms raw training trajectories into structured context, enabling small LLMs to analyze optimization progress with reliability comparable to larger models. Using two locally-run LLMs (phi4:reasoning14B and qwen2.5-coder:32B) and a 10-trial budget, our TCS-enabled HPT pipeline achieves average performance within ~0.9 percentage points of GPT-4 across six diverse tasks.</description>

      <title>Highly Imbalanced Regression with Tabular Data in SEP and Other Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate imbalanced regression with tabular data that have an imbalance ratio larger than 1,000 ("highly imbalanced"). Accurately estimating the target values of rare instances is important in applications such as forecasting the intensity of rare harmful Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events. For regression, the MSE loss does not consider the correlation between predicted and actual values. Typical inverse importance functions allow only convex functions. Uniform sampling might yield mini-batches that do not have rare instances. We propose CISIR that incorporates correlation, Monotonically Decreasing Involution (MDI) importance, and stratified sampling. Based on five datasets, our experimental results indicate that CISIR can achieve lower error and higher correlation than some recent methods. Also, adding our correlation component to other recent methods can improve their performance. Lastly, MDI importance can outperform other importance functions. Our code can be found in https://github.com/Machine-Earning/CISIR.</description>

      <title>LLM-Guided Co-Training for Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel weighted co-training approach that is guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). Namely, in our co-training approach, we use LLM labels on unlabeled data as target labels and co-train two encoder-only based networks that train each other over multiple iterations: first, all samples are forwarded through each network and historical estimates of each network's confidence in the LLM label are recorded; second, a dynamic importance weight is derived for each sample according to each network's belief in the quality of the LLM label for that sample; finally, the two networks exchange importance weights with each other -- each network back-propagates all samples weighted with the importance weights coming from its peer network and updates its own parameters. By strategically utilizing LLM-generated guidance, our approach significantly outperforms conventional SSL methods, particularly in settings with abundant unlabeled data. Empirical results show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on 4 out of 5 benchmark datasets and ranks first among 14 compared methods according to the Friedman test. Our results highlight a new direction in semi-supervised learning -- where LLMs serve as knowledge amplifiers, enabling backbone co-training models to achieve state-of-the-art performance efficiently.</description>

      <title>Towards Interpretable and Efficient Attention: Compressing All by Contracting a Few</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms in Transformers have gained significant empirical success. Nonetheless, the optimization objectives underlying their forward pass are still unclear. Additionally, the quadratic complexity of self-attention is increasingly prohibitive. Unlike the prior work on addressing the interpretability or efficiency issue separately, we propose a unified optimization objective to alleviate both issues simultaneously. By unrolling the optimization over the objective, we derive an inherently interpretable and efficient attention mechanism, which compresses all tokens into low-dimensional structures by contracting a few representative tokens and then broadcasting the contractions back. This Contract-and-Broadcast Self-Attention (CBSA) mechanism can not only scale linearly but also generalize existing attention mechanisms as its special cases. Experiments further demonstrate comparable performance and even superior advantages of CBSA on several visual tasks. Code is available at this https URL.</description>

      <title>SPRINT: Stochastic Performative Prediction With Variance Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Performative prediction (PP) is an algorithmic framework for optimizing machine learning (ML) models where the model's deployment affects the distribution of the data it is trained on. Compared to traditional ML with fixed data, designing algorithms in PP converging to a stable point -- known as a stationary performative stable (SPS) solution -- is more challenging than the counterpart in conventional ML tasks due to the model-induced distribution shifts. While considerable efforts have been made to find SPS solutions using methods such as repeated gradient descent (RGD) and greedy stochastic gradient descent (SGD-GD), most prior studies assumed a strongly convex loss until a recent work established $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence of SGD-GD to SPS solutions under smooth, non-convex losses. However, this latest progress is still based on the restricted bounded variance assumption in stochastic gradient estimates and yields convergence bounds with a non-vanishing error neighborhood that scales with the variance. This limitation motivates us to improve convergence rates and reduce error in stochastic optimization for PP, particularly in non-convex settings. Thus, we propose a new algorithm called stochastic performative prediction with variance reduction (SPRINT) and establish its convergence to an SPS solution at a rate of $O(1/T)$. Notably, the resulting error neighborhood is independent of the variance of the stochastic gradients. Experiments on multiple real datasets with non-convex models demonstrate that SPRINT outperforms SGD-GD in both convergence rate and stability.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sliced Wasserstein Distance Computation via Adaptive Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sliced Wasserstein distance (SW) reduces optimal transport on $\mathbb{R}^d$ to a sum of one-dimensional projections, and thanks to this efficiency, it is widely used in geometry, generative modeling, and registration tasks. Recent work shows that quasi-Monte Carlo constructions for computing SW (QSW) yield direction sets with excellent approximation error. This paper presents an alternate, novel approach: learning directions with Bayesian optimization (BO), particularly in settings where SW appears inside an optimization loop (e.g., gradient flows). We introduce a family of drop-in selectors for projection directions: BOSW, a one-shot BO scheme on the unit sphere; RBOSW, a periodic-refresh variant; ABOSW, an adaptive hybrid that seeds from competitive QSW sets and performs a few lightweight BO refinements; and ARBOSW, a restarted hybrid that periodically relearns directions during optimization. Our BO approaches can be composed with QSW and its variants (demonstrated by ABOSW/ARBOSW) and require no changes to downstream losses or gradients. We provide numerical experiments where our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, and on the experimental suite of the original QSW paper, we find that ABOSW and ARBOSW can achieve convergence comparable to the best QSW variants with modest runtime overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MMIR) suffers from weak semantic grounding and poor robustness under noisy or rare-class conditions. We propose MVCL-DAF++, which extends MVCL-DAF with two key modules: (1) Prototype-aware contrastive alignment, aligning instances to class-level prototypes to enhance semantic consistency; and (2) Coarse-to-fine attention fusion, integrating global modality summaries with token-level features for hierarchical cross-modal interaction. On MIntRec and MIntRec2.0, MVCL-DAF++ achieves new state-of-the-art results, improving rare-class recognition by +1.05\% and +4.18\% WF1, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of prototype-guided learning and coarse-to-fine fusion for robust multimodal understanding.

      <description>arXiv:2509.17894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient inference is a critical challenge in deep generative modeling, particularly as diffusion models grow in capacity and complexity. While increased complexity often improves accuracy, it raises compute costs, latency, and memory requirements. This work investigates techniques such as pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and simplified attention to reduce computational overhead without impacting performance. The study also explores the Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach to further enhance efficiency. These experiments provide insights into optimizing inference for the state-of-the-art Fast Diffusion Transformer (fast-DiT) model.</description>

      <title>Joint Memory Frequency and Computing Frequency Scaling for Energy-efficient DNN Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in diverse applications, but the problems of high latency and energy overhead are inevitable on resource-constrained devices. To address this challenge, most researchers focus on the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique to balance the latency and energy consumption by changing the computing frequency of processors. However, the adjustment of memory frequency is usually ignored and not fully utilized to achieve efficient DNN inference, which also plays a significant role in the inference time and energy consumption. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of joint memory frequency and computing frequency scaling on the inference time and energy consumption with a model-based and data-driven method. Then by combining with the fitting parameters of different DNN models, we give a preliminary analysis for the proposed model to see the effects of adjusting memory frequency and computing frequency simultaneously. Finally, simulation results in local inference and cooperative inference cases further validate the effectiveness of jointly scaling the memory frequency and computing frequency to reduce the energy consumption of devices.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Kernel Design for Bayesian Optimization Is a Piece of CAKE with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) relies heavily on the choice of the Gaussian process (GP) kernel, which plays a central role in balancing exploration and exploitation under limited evaluation budgets. Traditional BO methods often rely on fixed or heuristic kernel selection strategies, which can result in slow convergence or suboptimal solutions when the chosen kernel is poorly suited to the underlying objective function. To address this limitation, we propose a freshly-baked Context-Aware Kernel Evolution (CAKE) to enhance BO with large language models (LLMs). Concretely, CAKE leverages LLMs as the crossover and mutation operators to adaptively generate and refine GP kernels based on the observed data throughout the optimization process. To maximize the power of CAKE, we further propose BIC-Acquisition Kernel Ranking (BAKER) to select the most effective kernel through balancing the model fit measured by the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) with the expected improvement at each iteration of BO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fresh CAKE-based BO method consistently outperforms established baselines across a range of real-world tasks, including hyperparameter optimization, controller tuning, and photonic chip design. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/richardcsuwandi/cake.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Generation of Combinatorial Structures: Applications to Complexity Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore whether techniques from AI can help discover new combinatorial structures that improve on known limits on efficient algorithms. Specifically, we use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:
  a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional) lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using AlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper bounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error in the third decimal place.
  b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new inapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT and MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of improving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget reduction from "standard" H{\aa}stad-style PCPs.
  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time). In both settings above, our results were enabled by using AlphaEvolve itself to evolve the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\times$). We conclude with a discussion of norms by which to assess the assistance from AI in developing proofs.</description>

      <title>Strategic Dishonesty Can Undermine AI Safety Evaluations of Frontier LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) developers aim for their models to be honest, helpful, and harmless. However, when faced with malicious requests, models are trained to refuse, sacrificing helpfulness. We show that frontier LLMs can develop a preference for dishonesty as a new strategy, even when other options are available. Affected models respond to harmful requests with outputs that sound harmful but are crafted to be subtly incorrect or otherwise harmless in practice. This behavior emerges with hard-to-predict variations even within models from the same model family. We find no apparent cause for the propensity to deceive, but show that more capable models are better at executing this strategy. Strategic dishonesty already has a practical impact on safety evaluations, as we show that dishonest responses fool all output-based monitors used to detect jailbreaks that we test, rendering benchmark scores unreliable. Further, strategic dishonesty can act like a honeypot against malicious users, which noticeably obfuscates prior jailbreak attacks. While output monitors fail, we show that linear probes on internal activations can be used to reliably detect strategic dishonesty. We validate probes on datasets with verifiable outcomes and by using them as steering vectors. Overall, we consider strategic dishonesty as a concrete example of a broader concern that alignment of LLMs is hard to control, especially when helpfulness and harmlessness conflict.</description>

      <title>DANSE: Data-driven Non-linear State Estimation of Model-free Process in Unsupervised Learning Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the tasks of Bayesian state estimation and forecasting for a model-free process in an unsupervised learning setup. For a model-free process, we do not have any a-priori knowledge of the process dynamics. In the article, we propose DANSE -- a Data-driven Nonlinear State Estimation method. DANSE provides a closed-form posterior of the state of the model-free process, given linear measurements of the state. In addition, it provides a closed-form posterior for forecasting. A data-driven recurrent neural network (RNN) is used in DANSE to provide the parameters of a prior of the state. The prior depends on the past measurements as input, and then we find the closed-form posterior of the state using the current measurement as input. The data-driven RNN captures the underlying non-linear dynamics of the model-free process. The training of DANSE, mainly learning the parameters of the RNN, is executed using an unsupervised learning approach. In unsupervised learning, we have access to a training dataset comprising only a set of measurement data trajectories, but we do not have any access to the state trajectories. Therefore, DANSE does not have access to state information in the training data and can not use supervised learning. Using simulated linear and non-linear process models (Lorenz attractor and Chen attractor), we evaluate the unsupervised learning-based DANSE. We show that the proposed DANSE, without knowledge of the process model and without supervised learning, provides a competitive performance against model-driven methods, such as the Kalman filter (KF), extended KF (EKF), unscented KF (UKF), a data-driven deep Markov model (DMM) and a recently proposed hybrid method called KalmanNet. In addition, we show that DANSE works for high-dimensional state estimation.</description>

      <title>Improving Image Captioning Descriptiveness by Ranking and LLM-based Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-The-Art (SoTA) image captioning models are often trained on the MicroSoft Common Objects in Context (MS-COCO) dataset, which contains human-annotated captions with an average length of approximately ten tokens. Although effective for general scene understanding, these short captions often fail to capture complex scenes and convey detailed information. Moreover, captioning models tend to exhibit bias towards the ``average'' caption, which captures only the more general aspects, thus overlooking finer details. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate richer and more informative image captions by combining the captions generated from different SoTA captioning models. Our proposed method requires no additional model training: given an image, it leverages pre-trained models from the literature to generate the initial captions, and then ranks them using a newly introduced image-text-based metric, which we name BLIPScore. Subsequently, the top two captions are fused using a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the final, more detailed description. Experimental results on the MS-COCO and Flickr30k test sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of caption-image alignment and hallucination reduction according to the ALOHa, CAPTURE, and Polos metrics. A subjective study lends additional support to these results, suggesting that the captions produced by our model are generally perceived as more consistent with human judgment. By combining the strengths of diverse SoTA models, our method enhances the quality and appeal of image captions, bridging the gap between automated systems and the rich and informative nature of human-generated descriptions. This advance enables the generation of more suitable captions for the training of both vision-language and captioning models.</description>

      <title>MediSyn: A Generalist Text-Guided Latent Diffusion Model For Diverse Medical Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09806v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning algorithms require extensive data to achieve robust performance. However, data availability is often restricted in the medical domain due to patient privacy concerns. Synthetic data presents a possible solution to these challenges. Recently, image generative models have found increasing use for medical applications but are often designed for singular medical specialties and imaging modalities, thus limiting their broader utility. To address this, we introduce MediSyn: a text-guided, latent diffusion model capable of generating synthetic images from 6 medical specialties and 10 image types. Through extensive experimentation, we first demonstrate that MediSyn quantitatively matches or surpasses the performance of specialist models. Second, we show that our synthetic images are realistic and exhibit strong alignment with their corresponding text prompts, as validated by a team of expert physicians. Third, we provide empirical evidence that our synthetic images are visually distinct from their corresponding real patient images. Finally, we demonstrate that in data-limited settings, classifiers trained solely on synthetic data or real data supplemented with synthetic data can outperform those trained solely on real data. Our findings highlight the immense potential of generalist image generative models to accelerate algorithmic research and development in medicine.</description>

      <title>The ICML 2023 Ranking Experiment: Examining Author Self-Assessment in ML/AI Peer Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conducted an experiment during the review process of the 2023 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), asking authors with multiple submissions to rank their papers based on perceived quality. In total, we received 1,342 rankings, each from a different author, covering 2,592 submissions. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of how author-provided rankings could be leveraged to improve peer review processes at machine learning conferences. We focus on the Isotonic Mechanism, which calibrates raw review scores using the author-provided rankings. Our analysis shows that these ranking-calibrated scores outperform the raw review scores in estimating the ground truth ``expected review scores'' in terms of both squared and absolute error metrics. Furthermore, we propose several cautious, low-risk applications of the Isotonic Mechanism and author-provided rankings in peer review, including supporting senior area chairs in overseeing area chairs' recommendations, assisting in the selection of paper awards, and guiding the recruitment of emergency reviewers.</description>

      <title>GlaLSTM: A Concurrent LSTM Stream Framework for Glaucoma Detection via Biomarker Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Glaucoma is a complex group of eye diseases marked by optic nerve damage, commonly linked to elevated intraocular pressure and biomarkers like retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Understanding how these biomarkers interact is crucial for unraveling glaucoma's underlying mechanisms. In this paper, we propose GlaLSTM, a novel concurrent LSTM stream framework for glaucoma detection, leveraging latent biomarker relationships. Unlike traditional CNN-based models that primarily detect glaucoma from images, GlaLSTM provides deeper interpretability, revealing the key contributing factors and enhancing model transparency. This approach not only improves detection accuracy but also empowers clinicians with actionable insights, facilitating more informed decision-making. Experimental evaluations confirm that GlaLSTM surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its potential for both advanced biomarker analysis and reliable glaucoma detection.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Graph Theoretical Analysis of Resting-State fMRI for Classification of Alzheimer's Disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Healthy Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by memory loss and cognitive decline, making early detection vital for timely intervention. However, early diagnosis is challenging due to the heterogeneous presentation of symptoms. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) captures spontaneous brain activity and functional connectivity, which are known to be disrupted in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Traditional methods, such as Pearson's correlation, have been used to calculate association matrices, but these approaches often overlook the dynamic and non-stationary nature of brain activity. In this study, we introduce a novel method that integrates discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and graph theory to model the dynamic behavior of brain networks. Our approach captures the time-frequency representation of brain activity, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of the underlying network dynamics. Machine learning was employed to automate the discrimination of different stages of AD based on learned patterns from brain network at different frequency bands. We applied our method to a dataset of rs-fMRI images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, demonstrating its potential as an early diagnostic tool for AD and for monitoring disease progression. Our statistical analysis identifies specific brain regions and connections that are affected in AD and MCI, at different frequency bands, offering deeper insights into the disease's impact on brain function.</description>

      <title>EarthquakeNPP: A Benchmark for Earthquake Forecasting with Neural Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For decades, classical point process models, such as the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model, have been widely used for forecasting the event times and locations of earthquakes. Recent advances have led to Neural Point Processes (NPPs), which promise greater flexibility and improvements over such classical models. However, the currently-used benchmark for NPPs does not represent an up-to-date challenge in the seismological community, since it contains data leakage and omits the largest earthquake sequence from the region. Additionally, initial earthquake forecasting benchmarks fail to compare NPPs with state-of-the-art forecasting models commonly used in seismology. To address these gaps, we introduce EarthquakeNPP: a collection of benchmark datasets to facilitate testing of NPPs on earthquake data, accompanied by an implementation of the state-of-the-art forecasting model: ETAS. The datasets cover a range of small to large target regions within California, dating from 1971 to 2021, and include different methodologies for dataset generation. Benchmarking experiments, using both log-likelihood and generative evaluation metrics widely recognised in seismology, show that none of the five NPPs tested outperform ETAS. These findings suggest that current NPP implementations are not yet suitable for practical earthquake forecasting. Nonetheless, EarthquakeNPP provides a platform to foster future collaboration between the seismology and machine learning communities.</description>

      <title>Exploring Model Kinship for Merging Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). The open-source community has driven model evolution by iteratively merging existing models, yet a principled understanding of the gains and underlying factors in model merging remains limited. In this work, we study model evolution through iterative merging, drawing an analogy to biological evolution, and introduce the concept of model kinship, the degree of similarity or relatedness between LLMs. Through comprehensive empirical analysis, we show that model kinship is closely linked to the performance improvements achieved by merging, providing a useful criterion for selecting candidate models. Building on this insight, we propose a new model merging strategy: Top-k Greedy Merging with Model Kinship, which can improve benchmark performance. Specifically, we discover that incorporating model kinship as a guiding criterion enables continuous merging while mitigating performance degradation caused by local optima, thereby facilitating more effective model evolution.

      <title>EMMA: End-to-End Multimodal Model for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce EMMA, an End-to-end Multimodal Model for Autonomous driving. Built upon a multi-modal large language model foundation like Gemini, EMMA directly maps raw camera sensor data into various driving-specific outputs, including planner trajectories, perception objects, and road graph elements. EMMA maximizes the utility of world knowledge from the pre-trained large language models, by representing all non-sensor inputs (e.g. navigation instructions and ego vehicle status) and outputs (e.g. trajectories and 3D locations) as natural language text. This approach allows EMMA to jointly process various driving tasks in a unified language space, and generate the outputs for each task using task-specific prompts. Empirically, we demonstrate EMMA's effectiveness by achieving state-of-the-art performance in motion planning on nuScenes as well as competitive results on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD). EMMA also yields competitive results for camera-primary 3D object detection on the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD). We show that co-training EMMA with planner trajectories, object detection, and road graph tasks yields improvements across all three domains, highlighting EMMA's potential as a generalist model for autonomous driving applications. We hope that our results will inspire research to further evolve the state of the art in autonomous driving model architectures.</description>

      <title>Language Models as Causal Effect Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present sequence-driven structural causal models (SD-SCMs), a framework for specifying causal models with user-defined structure and language-model-defined mechanisms. We characterize how an SD-SCM enables sampling from observational, interventional, and counterfactual distributions according to the desired causal structure. We then leverage this procedure to propose a new type of benchmark for causal inference methods, generating individual-level counterfactual data to test treatment effect estimation. We create an example benchmark consisting of thousands of datasets, and test a suite of popular estimation methods for average, conditional average, and individual treatment effect estimation. We find under this benchmark that (1) causal methods outperform non-causal methods and that (2) even state-of-the-art methods struggle with individualized effect estimation, suggesting this benchmark captures some inherent difficulties in causal estimation. Apart from generating data, this same technique can underpin the auditing of language models for (un)desirable causal effects, such as misinformation or discrimination. We believe SD-SCMs can serve as a useful tool in any application that would benefit from sequential data with controllable causal structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in general domains, but their application to multi-omics biology remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Biology-Instructions, the first large-scale instruction-tuning dataset for multi-omics biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and multi-molecules. This dataset bridges LLMs and complex biological sequence-related tasks, enhancing their versatility and reasoning while maintaining conversational fluency. We also highlight significant limitations of current state-of-the-art LLMs on multi-omics tasks without specialized training. To overcome this, we propose ChatMultiOmics, a strong baseline with a novel three-stage training pipeline, demonstrating superior biological understanding through Biology-Instructions. Both resources are publicly available, paving the way for better integration of LLMs in multi-omics analysis. The Biology-Instructions is publicly available at: https://github.com/hhnqqq/Biology-Instructions.</description>

      <title>Variational decision diagrams for quantum-inspired machine learning applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decision diagrams (DDs) have emerged as an efficient tool for simulating quantum circuits due to their capacity to exploit data redundancies in quantum states and quantum operations, enabling the efficient computation of probability amplitudes. However, their application in quantum machine learning (QML) has remained unexplored. This paper introduces variational decision diagrams (VDDs), a novel graph structure that combines the structural benefits of DDs with the adaptability of variational methods for efficiently representing quantum states. We investigate the trainability of VDDs by applying them to the ground state estimation problem for transverse-field Ising and Heisenberg Hamiltonians. Analysis of gradient variance suggests that training VDDs is possible, as no signs of vanishing gradients--also known as barren plateaus--are observed. This work provides new insights into the use of decision diagrams in QML as an alternative to design and train variational ans\"atze.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials for Long-Range Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials have emerged as a revolutionary class of force-field models in molecular simulations, delivering quantum-mechanical accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost and enabling the simulation of large-scale systems over extended timescales. However, they often focus on modeling local environments, neglecting crucial long-range interactions. We propose a Sum-of-Gaussians Neural Network (SOG-Net), a lightweight and versatile framework for integrating long-range interactions into machine learning force field. The SOG-Net employs a latent-variable learning network that seamlessly bridges short-range and long-range components, coupled with an efficient Fourier convolution layer that incorporates long-range effects. By learning sum-of-Gaussians multipliers across different convolution layers, the SOG-Net adaptively captures diverse long-range decay behaviors while maintaining close-to-linear computational complexity during training and simulation via non-uniform fast Fourier transforms. The method is demonstrated effective for a broad range of long-range systems.</description>

Abstract: The optimization foundations of deep linear networks have recently received significant attention. However, due to their inherent non-convexity and hierarchical structure, analyzing the loss functions of deep linear networks remains a challenging task. In this work, we study the local geometric landscape of the regularized squared loss of deep linear networks around each critical point. Specifically, we derive a closed-form characterization of the critical point set and establish an error bound for the regularized loss under mild conditions on network width and regularization parameters. Notably, this error bound quantifies the distance from a point to the critical point set in terms of the current gradient norm, which can be used to derive linear convergence of first-order methods. To support our theoretical findings, we conduct numerical experiments and demonstrate that gradient descent converges linearly to a critical point when optimizing the regularized loss of deep linear networks.</description>

Abstract: Estimating Mutual Information (MI), a key measure of dependence of random quantities without specific modelling assumptions, is a challenging problem in high dimensions. We propose a novel mutual information estimator based on parametrizing conditional densities using normalizing flows, a deep generative model that has gained popularity in recent years. This estimator leverages a block autoregressive structure to achieve improved bias-variance trade-offs on standard benchmark tasks.</description>

      <title>Language Models Can Predict Their Own Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The text produced by language models (LMs) can exhibit specific `behaviors,' such as a failure to follow alignment training, that we hope to detect and react to during deployment. Identifying these behaviors can often only be done post facto, i.e., after the entire text of the output has been generated. We provide evidence that there are times when we can predict how an LM will behave early in computation, before even a single token is generated. We show that probes trained on the internal representation of input tokens alone can predict a wide range of eventual behaviors over the entire output sequence. Using methods from conformal prediction, we provide provable bounds on the estimation error of our probes, creating precise early warning systems for these behaviors. The conformal probes can identify instances that will trigger alignment failures (jailbreaking) and instruction-following failures, without requiring a single token to be generated. An early warning system built on the probes reduces jailbreaking by 91%. Our probes also show promise in pre-emptively estimating how confident the model will be in its response, a behavior that cannot be detected using the output text alone. Conformal probes can preemptively estimate the final prediction of an LM that uses Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, hence accelerating inference. When applied to an LM that uses CoT to perform text classification, the probes drastically reduce inference costs (65% on average across 27 datasets), with negligible accuracy loss. Encouragingly, probes generalize to unseen datasets and perform better on larger models, suggesting applicability to the largest of models in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>LightThinker: Thinking Step-by-Step Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks, but their efficiency is hindered by the substantial memory and computational costs associated with generating lengthy tokens. In this paper, we propose LightThinker, a novel method that enables LLMs to dynamically compress intermediate thoughts during reasoning. Inspired by human cognitive processes, LightThinker compresses verbose thought steps into compact representations and discards the original reasoning chains, thereby significantly reducing the number of tokens stored in the context window. This is achieved by training the model on when and how to perform compression through data construction, mapping hidden states to condensed gist tokens, and creating specialized attention masks. Additionally, we introduce the Dependency (Dep) metric to quantify the degree of compression by measuring the reliance on historical tokens during generation. Extensive experiments on four datasets and two models show that LightThinker reduces peak memory usage and inference time, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our work provides a new direction for improving the efficiency of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks without sacrificing performance. Code is released at https://github.com/zjunlp/LightThinker.</description>

      <title>THFlow: A Temporally Hierarchical Flow Matching Framework for 3D Peptide Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models provide a promising approach to de novo 3D peptide design. Most of them jointly model the distributions of peptide's position, orientation, and conformation, attempting to simultaneously converge to the target pocket. However, in the early stage of docking, optimizing conformation-only modalities such as rotation and torsion can be physically meaningless, as the peptide is initialized far from the protein pocket and no interaction field is present. We define this problem as the multimodal temporal inconsistency problem and claim it is a key factor contributing to low binding affinity in generated peptides. To address this challenge, we propose THFlow, a novel flow matching-based multimodal generative model that explicitly models the temporal hierarchy between peptide position and conformation. It employs a polynomial based conditional flow to accelerate positional convergence early on, and later aligns it with rotation and torsion for coordinated conformation refinement under the emerging interaction field. Additionally, we incorporate interaction-related features, such as polarity, to further enhance the model's understanding of peptide-protein binding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that THFlow outperforms existing methods in generating peptides with superior stability, affinity, and diversity, offering an effective and accurate solution for advancing peptide-based therapeutic development.</description>

      <title>SCoT: Straight Consistent Trajectory for Pre-Trained Diffusion Model Distillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models are commonly used to generate clean data (e.g., images) from random noises, effectively forming pairs of noises and corresponding clean images. Distillation on these pre-trained models can be viewed as the process of constructing advanced trajectories within the pair to accelerate sampling. For instance, consistency model distillation develops consistent projection functions to regulate trajectories, although sampling efficiency remains a concern. Rectified flow method enforces straight trajectories to enable faster sampling, yet relies on numerical ODE solvers, which may introduce approximation errors. In this work, we bridge the gap between the consistency model and the rectified flow method by proposing a Straight Consistent Trajectory~(SCoT) model. SCoT enjoys the benefits of both approaches for fast sampling, producing trajectories with consistent and straight properties simultaneously. These dual properties are strategically balanced by targeting two critical objectives: (1) regulating the gradient of SCoT's mapping to a constant, (2) ensuring trajectory consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SCoT.</description>

      <title>Structure-prior Informed Diffusion Model for Graph Source Localization with Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Source localization in graph information propagation is essential for mitigating network disruptions, including misinformation spread, cyber threats, and infrastructure failures. Existing deep generative approaches face significant challenges in real-world applications due to limited propagation data availability. We present SIDSL (\textbf{S}tructure-prior \textbf{I}nformed \textbf{D}iffusion model for \textbf{S}ource \textbf{L}ocalization), a generative diffusion framework that leverages topology-aware priors to enable robust source localization with limited data. SIDSL addresses three key challenges: unknown propagation patterns through structure-based source estimations via graph label propagation, complex topology-propagation relationships via a propagation-enhanced conditional denoiser with GNN-parameterized label propagation module, and class imbalance through structure-prior biased diffusion initialization. By learning pattern-invariant features from synthetic data generated by established propagation models, SIDSL enables effective knowledge transfer to real-world scenarios. Experimental evaluation on four real-world datasets demonstrates superior performance with 7.5-13.3\% F1 score improvements over baselines, including over 19\% improvement in few-shot and 40\% in zero-shot settings, validating the framework's effectiveness for practical source localization.

      <title>Promote, Suppress, Iterate: How Language Models Answer One-to-Many Factual Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To answer one-to-many factual queries (e.g., listing cities of a country), a language model (LM) must simultaneously recall knowledge and avoid repeating previous answers. How are these two subtasks implemented and integrated internally? Across multiple datasets, models, and prompt templates, we identify a promote-then-suppress mechanism: the model first recalls all answers, and then suppresses previously generated ones. Specifically, LMs use both the subject and previous answer tokens to perform knowledge recall, with attention propagating subject information and MLPs promoting the answers. Then, attention attends to and suppresses previous answer tokens, while MLPs amplify the suppression signal. Our mechanism is corroborated by extensive experimental evidence: in addition to using early decoding and causal tracing, we analyze how components use different tokens by introducing both Token Lens, which decodes aggregated attention updates from specified tokens, and a knockout method that analyzes changes in MLP outputs after removing attention to specified tokens. Overall, we provide new insights into how LMs' internal components interact with different input tokens to support complex factual recall.

      <title>CaKE: Circuit-aware Editing Enables Generalizable Knowledge Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) enables the modification of outdated or incorrect information in large language models (LLMs). While existing KE methods can update isolated facts, they often fail to generalize these updates to multi-hop reasoning tasks that rely on the modified knowledge. Through an analysis of reasoning circuits -- the neural pathways LLMs use for knowledge-based inference, we find that current layer-localized KE approaches (e.g., MEMIT, WISE), which edit only single or a few model layers, inadequately integrate updated knowledge into these reasoning pathways. To address this limitation, we present CaKE (Circuit-aware Knowledge Editing), a novel method that enhances the effective integration of updated knowledge in LLMs. By only leveraging a few curated data samples guided by our circuit-based analysis, CaKE stimulates the model to develop appropriate reasoning circuits for newly incorporated knowledge. Experiments show that CaKE enables more accurate and consistent use of edited knowledge across related reasoning tasks, achieving an average improvement of 20% in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on the MQuAKE dataset while requiring less memory than existing KE methods. We release the code and data in https://github.com/zjunlp/CaKE.</description>

      <title>LookAhead Tuning: Safer Language Models via Partial Answer Previews</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to specific domains, but often compromises their previously established safety alignment. To mitigate the degradation of model safety during fine-tuning, we introduce LookAhead Tuning, a lightweight and effective data-driven approach that preserves safety during fine-tuning. The method introduces two simple strategies that modify training data by previewing partial answer prefixes, thereby minimizing perturbations to the model's initial token distributions and maintaining its built-in safety mechanisms. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LookAhead Tuning effectively maintains model safety without sacrificing robust performance on downstream tasks. Our findings position LookAhead Tuning as a reliable and efficient solution for the safe and effective adaptation of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Robust DNN Partitioning and Resource Allocation Under Uncertain Inference Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In edge intelligence systems, deep neural network (DNN) partitioning and data offloading can provide real-time task inference for resource-constrained mobile devices. However, the inference time of DNNs is typically uncertain and cannot be precisely determined in advance, presenting significant challenges in ensuring timely task processing within deadlines. To address the uncertain inference time, we propose a robust optimization scheme to minimize the total energy consumption of mobile devices while meeting task probabilistic deadlines. The scheme only requires the mean and variance information of the inference time, without any prediction methods or distribution functions. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) that involves jointly optimizing the DNN model partitioning and the allocation of local CPU/GPU frequencies and uplink bandwidth. To tackle the problem, we first decompose the original problem into two subproblems: resource allocation and DNN model partitioning. Subsequently, the two subproblems with probability constraints are equivalently transformed into deterministic optimization problems using the chance-constrained programming (CCP) method. Finally, the convex optimization technique and the penalty convex-concave procedure (PCCP) technique are employed to obtain the optimal solution of the resource allocation subproblem and a stationary point of the DNN model partitioning subproblem, respectively. The proposed algorithm leverages real-world data from popular hardware platforms and is evaluated on widely used DNN models. Extensive simulations show that our proposed algorithm effectively addresses the inference time uncertainty with probabilistic deadline guarantees while minimizing the energy consumption of mobile devices.</description>

      <title>SupertonicTTS: Towards Highly Efficient and Streamlined Text-to-Speech System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce SupertonicTTS, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) system designed for efficient and streamlined speech synthesis. SupertonicTTS comprises three components: a speech autoencoder for continuous latent representation, a text-to-latent module leveraging flow-matching for text-to-latent mapping, and an utterance-level duration predictor. To enable a lightweight architecture, we employ a low-dimensional latent space, temporal compression of latents, and ConvNeXt blocks. The TTS pipeline is further simplified by operating directly on raw character-level text and employing cross-attention for text-speech alignment, thus eliminating the need for grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) modules and external aligners. In addition, we propose context-sharing batch expansion that accelerates loss convergence and stabilizes text-speech alignment with minimal memory and I/O overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that SupertonicTTS delivers performance comparable to contemporary zero-shot TTS models with only 44M parameters, while significantly reducing architectural complexity and computational cost.

      <description>arXiv:2504.13110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the approximation gap between the dynamics of a polynomial-width neural network and its infinite-width counterpart, both trained using projected gradient descent in the mean-field scaling regime. We demonstrate how to tightly bound this approximation gap through a differential equation governed by the mean-field dynamics. A key factor influencing the growth of this ODE is the local Hessian of each particle, defined as the derivative of the particle's velocity in the mean-field dynamics with respect to its position. We apply our results to the canonical feature learning problem of estimating a well-specified single-index model; we permit the information exponent to be arbitrarily large, leading to convergence times that grow polynomially in the ambient dimension $d$. We show that, due to a certain ``self-concordance'' property in these problems -- where the local Hessian of a particle is bounded by a constant times the particle's velocity -- polynomially many neurons are sufficient to closely approximate the mean-field dynamics throughout training.</description>

      <title>Phantora: Maximizing Code Reuse in Simulation-based Machine Learning System Performance Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning (ML) training workloads place substantial demands on both computational and communication resources. Consequently, accurate performance estimation has become increasingly critical for guiding system design decisions, such as the selection of parallelization strategies, cluster configurations, and hardware provisioning. Existing simulation-based performance estimation requires reimplementing the ML framework in a simulator, which demands significant manual effort and is hard to maintain as ML frameworks evolve rapidly.
  This paper introduces Phantora, a hybrid GPU cluster simulator designed for performance estimation of ML training workloads. Phantora executes unmodified ML frameworks as is within a distributed, containerized environment. Each container emulates the behavior of a GPU server in a large-scale cluster, while Phantora intercepts and simulates GPU- and communication-related operations to provide high-fidelity performance estimation. We call this approach hybrid simulation of ML systems, in contrast to traditional methods that simulate static workloads. The primary advantage of hybrid simulation is that it allows direct reuse of ML framework source code in simulation, avoiding the need for reimplementation. Our evaluation shows that Phantora provides accuracy comparable to static workload simulation while supporting three state-of-the-art LLM training frameworks out-of-the-box. In addition, Phantora operates on a single GPU, eliminating the need for the resource-intensive trace collection and workload extraction steps required by traditional trace-based simulators. Phantora is open-sourced at https://github.com/QDelta/Phantora.</description>

Abstract: Few-shot relational learning on knowledge graph (KGs) aims to perform reasoning over relations with only a few training examples. While current methods have focused primarily on leveraging specific relational information, rich semantics inherent in KGs have been largely overlooked. To bridge this gap, we propose PromptMeta, a novel prompted meta-learning framework that seamlessly integrates meta-semantics with relational information for few-shot relational learning. PromptMeta introduces two core innovations: (1) a Meta-Semantic Prompt (MSP) pool that learns and consolidates high-level meta-semantics shared across tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer and adaptation to newly emerging relations; and (2) a learnable fusion mechanism that dynamically combines meta-semantics with task-specific relational information tailored to different few-shot tasks. Both components are optimized jointly with model parameters within a meta-learning framework. Extensive experiments and analyses on two real-world KG benchmarks validate the effectiveness of PromptMeta in adapting to new relations with limited supervision.</description>

      <title>WavReward: Spoken Dialogue Models With Generalist Reward Evaluators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: End-to-end spoken dialogue models such as GPT-4o-audio have recently garnered significant attention in the speech domain. However, the evaluation of spoken dialogue models' conversational performance has largely been overlooked. This is primarily due to the intelligent chatbots convey a wealth of non-textual information which cannot be easily measured using text-based language models like ChatGPT. To address this gap, we propose WavReward, a reward feedback model based on audio language models that can evaluate both the IQ and EQ of spoken dialogue systems with speech input. Specifically, 1) based on audio language models, WavReward incorporates the deep reasoning process and the nonlinear reward mechanism for post-training. By utilizing multi-sample feedback via the reinforcement learning algorithm, we construct a specialized evaluator tailored to spoken dialogue models. 2) We introduce ChatReward-30K, a preference dataset used to train WavReward. ChatReward-30K includes both comprehension and generation aspects of spoken dialogue models. These scenarios span various tasks, such as text-based chats, nine acoustic attributes of instruction chats, and implicit chats. WavReward outperforms previous state-of-the-art evaluation models across multiple spoken dialogue scenarios, achieving a substantial improvement about Qwen2.5-Omni in objective accuracy from 53.4$\%$ to 91.5$\%$. In subjective A/B testing, WavReward also leads by a margin of 83$\%$. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each component of WavReward. All data and code will be publicly at https://github.com/jishengpeng/WavReward after the paper is accepted.</description>

      <title>Can Global XAI Methods Reveal Injected Bias in LLMs? SHAP vs Rule Extraction vs RuleSHAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can amplify misinformation, undermining societal goals like the UN SDGs. We study three documented drivers of misinformation (valence framing, information overload, and oversimplification) which are often shaped by one's default beliefs. Building on evidence that LLMs encode such defaults (e.g., "joy is positive," "math is complex") and can act as "bags of heuristics," we ask: can general belief-driven heuristics behind misinformative behaviour be recovered from LLMs as clear rules? A key obstacle is that global rule-extraction methods in explainable AI (XAI) are built for numerical inputs/outputs, not text. We address this by eliciting global LLM beliefs and mapping them to numerical scores via statistically reliable abstractions, thereby enabling off-the-shelf global XAI to detect belief-related heuristics in LLMs. To obtain ground truth, we hard-code bias-inducing nonlinear heuristics of increasing complexity (univariate, conjunctive, nonconvex) into popular LLMs (ChatGPT and Llama) via system instructions. This way, we find that RuleFit under-detects non-univariate biases, while global SHAP better approximates conjunctive ones but does not yield actionable rules. To bridge this gap, we propose RuleSHAP, a rule-extraction algorithm that couples global SHAP-value aggregations with rule induction to better capture non-univariate bias, improving heuristics detection over RuleFit by +94% (MRR@1) on average. Our results provide a practical pathway for revealing belief-driven biases in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Losing is for Cherishing: Data Valuation Based on Machine Unlearning and Shapley Value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of large models has intensified the need for efficient data valuation methods to quantify the contribution of individual data providers. Traditional approaches, such as game-theory-based Shapley value and influence-function-based techniques, face prohibitive computational costs or require access to full data and model training details, making them hardly achieve partial data valuation. To address this, we propose Unlearning Shapley, a novel framework that leverages machine unlearning to estimate data values efficiently. By unlearning target data from a pretrained model and measuring performance shifts on a reachable test set, our method computes Shapley values via Monte Carlo sampling, avoiding retraining and eliminating dependence on full data. Crucially, Unlearning Shapley supports both full and partial data valuation, making it scalable for large models (e.g., LLMs) and practical for data markets. Experiments on benchmark datasets and large-scale text corpora demonstrate that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational overhead by orders of magnitude. Further analysis confirms a strong correlation between estimated values and the true impact of data subsets, validating its reliability in real-world scenarios. This work bridges the gap between data valuation theory and practical deployment, offering a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for modern AI ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Implicitly Learn to See and Hear Just By Reading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a fascinating find: By training an auto-regressive LLM model on text tokens, the text model inherently develops internally an ability to understand images and audio, thereby developing the ability to see and hear just by reading. Popular audio and visual LLM models fine-tune text LLM models to give text output conditioned on images and audio embeddings. On the other hand, our architecture takes in patches of images, audio waveforms or tokens as input. It gives us the embeddings or category labels typical of a classification pipeline. We show the generality of text weights in aiding audio classification for datasets FSD-50K and GTZAN. Further, we show this working for image classification on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, as well on image patches. This pushes the notion of text-LLMs learning powerful internal circuits that can be utilized by activating necessary connections for various applications rather than training models from scratch every single time.</description>

      <title>BroadGen: A Framework for Generating Effective and Efficient Advertiser Broad Match Keyphrase Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the domain of sponsored search advertising, the focus of {Keyphrase recommendation has largely been on exact match types, which pose issues such as high management expenses, limited targeting scope, and evolving search query patterns. Alternatives like Broad match types can alleviate certain drawbacks of exact matches but present challenges like poor targeting accuracy and minimal supervisory signals owing to limited advertiser usage. This research defines the criteria for an ideal broad match, emphasizing on both efficiency and effectiveness, ensuring that a significant portion of matched queries are relevant. We propose BroadGen, an innovative framework that recommends efficient and effective broad match keyphrases by utilizing historical search query data. Additionally, we demonstrate that BroadGen, through token correspondence modeling, maintains better query stability over time. BroadGen's capabilities allow it to serve daily, millions of sellers at eBay with over 2.5 billion items.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coordinating the motion between lower and upper limbs and aligning limb control with perception are substantial challenges in robotics, particularly in dynamic environments. To this end, we introduce an approach for enabling legged mobile manipulators to play badminton, a task that requires precise coordination of perception, locomotion, and arm swinging. We propose a unified reinforcement learning-based control policy for whole-body visuomotor skills involving all degrees of freedom to achieve effective shuttlecock tracking and striking. This policy is informed by a perception noise model that utilizes real-world camera data, allowing for consistent perception error levels between simulation and deployment and encouraging learned active perception behaviors. Our method includes a shuttlecock prediction model, constrained reinforcement learning for robust motion control, and integrated system identification techniques to enhance deployment readiness. Extensive experimental results in a variety of environments validate the robot's capability to predict shuttlecock trajectories, navigate the service area effectively, and execute precise strikes against human players, demonstrating the feasibility of using legged mobile manipulators in complex and dynamic sports scenarios.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Spectral Feature Learning for Instrumental Variable Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden confounders, using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. A leading strategy employs spectral features - that is, learned features spanning the top eigensubspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. We derive a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator based on spectral features, and gain insights into the method's performance and failure modes. We show that performance depends on two key factors, leading to a clear taxonomy of outcomes. In a good scenario, the approach is optimal. This occurs with strong spectral alignment, meaning the structural function is well-represented by the top eigenfunctions of the conditional operator, coupled with this operator's slow eigenvalue decay, indicating a strong instrument. Performance degrades in a bad scenario: spectral alignment remains strong, but rapid eigenvalue decay (indicating a weaker instrument) demands significantly more samples for effective feature learning. Finally, in the ugly scenario, weak spectral alignment causes the method to fail, regardless of the eigenvalues' characteristics. Our synthetic experiments empirically validate this taxonomy.</description>

      <title>Latent Representation Learning of Multi-scale Thermophysics: Application to Dynamics in Shocked Porous Energetic Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupling of physics across length and time scales plays an important role in the response of microstructured materials to external loads. In a multi-scale framework, unresolved (subgrid) meso-scale dynamics is upscaled to the homogenized (macro-scale) representation of the heterogeneous material through closure models. Deep learning models trained using meso-scale simulation data are now a popular route to assimilate such closure laws. However, meso-scale simulations are computationally taxing, posing practical challenges in training deep learning-based surrogate models from scratch. In this work, we investigate an alternative meta-learning approach motivated by the idea of tokenization in natural language processing. We show that one can learn a reduced representation of the micro-scale physics to accelerate the meso-scale learning process by tokenizing the meso-scale evolution of the physical fields involved in an archetypal, albeit complex, reactive dynamics problem, \textit{viz.}, shock-induced energy localization in a porous energetic material. A probabilistic latent representation of \textit{micro}-scale dynamics is learned as building blocks for \textit{meso}-scale dynamics. The \textit{meso-}scale latent dynamics model learns the correlation between neighboring building blocks by training over a small dataset of meso-scale simulations. We compare the performance of our model with a physics-aware recurrent convolutional neural network (PARC) trained only on the full meso-scale dataset. We demonstrate that our model can outperform PARC with scarce meso-scale data. The proposed approach accelerates the development of closure models by leveraging inexpensive micro-scale simulations and fast training over a small meso-scale dataset, and can be applied to a range of multi-scale modeling problems.</description>

      <title>LogicGuard: Improving Embodied LLM agents through Temporal Logic based Critics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in zero-shot and single step reasoning and decision making problems, but in long horizon sequential planning tasks, their errors compound, often leading to unreliable or inefficient behavior. We introduce LogicGuard, a modular actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by a trajectory level LLM critic that communicates through Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient behavior. LogicGuard supports both fixed safety rules and adaptive, learned constraints, and is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve as the actor, with LogicGuard acting as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LogicGuard to analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules that improve future behavior. To demonstrate generality, we evaluate LogicGuard across two distinct settings: short-horizon general tasks and long-horizon specialist tasks. On the Behavior benchmark of 100 household tasks, LogicGuard increases task completion rates by 25% over a baseline InnerMonologue planner. On the Minecraft diamond-mining task, which is long-horizon and requires multiple interdependent subgoals, LogicGuard improves both efficiency and safety compared to SayCan and InnerMonologue. These results show that enabling LLMs to supervise each other through temporal logic yields more reliable, efficient and safe decision-making for both embodied agents.</description>

      <title>A Resource Efficient Quantum Kernel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum processors may enhance machine learning by mapping high-dimensional data onto quantum systems for processing. Conventional feature maps, for encoding data onto a quantum circuit are currently impractical, as the number of entangling gates scales quadratically with the dimension of the dataset and the number of qubits. In this work, we introduce a quantum feature map designed to handle high-dimensional data with a significantly reduced number of qubits and entangling operations. Our approach preserves essential data characteristics while promoting computational efficiency, as evidenced by extensive experiments on benchmark datasets that demonstrate a marked improvement in both accuracy and resource utilization when using our feature map as a kernel for characterization, as compared to state-of-the-art quantum feature maps. Our noisy simulation results, combined with lower resource requirements, highlight our map's ability to function within the constraints of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Through numerical simulations and small-scale implementation on a superconducting circuit quantum computing platform, we demonstrate that our scheme performs on par or better than a set of classical algorithms for classification. While quantum kernels are typically stymied by exponential concentration, our approach is affected with a slower rate with respect to both the number of qubits and features, which allows practical applications to remain within reach. Our findings herald a promising avenue for the practical implementation of quantum machine learning algorithms on near future quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP): A Distribution-Free Statistical and Machine Learning Framework for Adaptive Risk Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP), a distribution-free framework for constructing well-calibrated prediction intervals in nonstationary time series. TCP combines a quantile forecaster with split-conformal calibration on a rolling window and, in its TCP-RM variant, augments the conformal threshold with a Robbins-Monro (RM) offset to steer coverage toward a target level in real time. We benchmark TCP against GARCH, Historical Simulation, and a rolling Quantile Regression (QR) baseline across equities (S&amp;P500), cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), and commodities (Gold). Three consistent findings emerge. First, rolling QR produces the sharpest intervals but is materially under-calibrated (e.g., S&amp;P500: 86.3% vs. 95% target). Second, TCP and TCP-RM achieve near-nominal coverage while delivering substantially narrower intervals than Historical Simulation (e.g., S&amp;P500: 29% reduction in width). Third, the RM update improves calibration with negligible width cost. Crisis-window visualizations around March 2020 show TCP/TCP-RM expanding and contracting intervals promptly as volatility spikes and recedes, with red dots marking days of miscoverage. A sensitivity study confirms robustness to window size and step-size choices. Overall, TCP provides a practical, theoretically grounded solution for calibrated uncertainty quantification under distribution shift, bridging statistical inference and machine learning for risk forecasting.</description>

      <title>Intra-DP: A High Performance Collaborative Inference System for Mobile Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained mobile devices presents significant challenges, particularly in achieving real-time performance while simultaneously coping with limited computational resources and battery life. While Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers collaborative inference with GPU servers as a promising solution, existing approaches primarily rely on layer-wise model partitioning and undergo significant transmission bottlenecks caused by the sequential execution of DNN operations. To address this challenge, we present Intra-DP, a high-performance collaborative inference system optimized for DNN inference on MEC. Intra DP employs a novel parallel computing technique based on local operators (i.e., operators whose minimum unit input is not the entire input tensor, such as the convolution kernel). By decomposing their computations (operations) into several independent sub-operations and overlapping the computation and transmission of different sub-operations through parallel execution, Intra-DP mitigates transmission bottlenecks in MEC, achieving fast and energy-efficient inference. The evaluation demonstrates that Intra-DP reduces per-inference latency by up to 50% and energy consumption by up to 75% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, without sacrificing accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns, particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical, interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI systems.</description>

      <title>Measuring Sample Quality with Copula Discrepancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that underpin modern Bayesian machine learning, such as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD), sacrifice asymptotic exactness for computational speed, creating a critical diagnostic gap: traditional sample quality measures fail catastrophically when applied to biased samplers. While powerful Stein-based diagnostics can detect distributional mismatches, they provide no direct assessment of dependence structure, often the primary inferential target in multivariate problems. We introduce the Copula Discrepancy (CD), a principled and computationally efficient diagnostic that leverages Sklar's theorem to isolate and quantify the fidelity of a sample's dependence structure independent of its marginals. Our theoretical framework provides the first structure-aware diagnostic specifically designed for the era of approximate inference. Empirically, we demonstrate that a moment-based CD dramatically outperforms standard diagnostics like effective sample size for hyperparameter selection in biased MCMC, correctly identifying optimal configurations where traditional methods fail. Furthermore, our robust MLE-based variant can detect subtle but critical mismatches in tail dependence that remain invisible to rank correlation-based approaches, distinguishing between samples with identical Kendall's tau but fundamentally different extreme-event behavior. With computational overhead orders of magnitude lower than existing Stein discrepancies, the CD provides both immediate practical value for MCMC practitioners and a theoretical foundation for the next generation of structure-aware sample quality assessment.</description>

      <title>Q-DPTS: Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting via Variational Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is vital in domains where data sensitivity is paramount, such as finance and energy systems. While Differential Privacy (DP) provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA, QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower prediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work presents one of the first explorations into quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting, offering promising directions for secure and accurate time series modeling in privacy-critical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Training Language Model Agents to Find Vulnerabilities with CTF-Dojo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities when trained within executable runtime environments, notably excelling at software engineering tasks through verified feedback loops. Yet, scalable and generalizable execution-grounded environments remain scarce, limiting progress in training more capable ML agents. We introduce CTF-Dojo, the first large-scale executable runtime tailored for training LLMs with verifiable feedback, featuring 658 fully functional Capture-The-Flag (CTF)-style challenges containerized in Docker with guaranteed reproducibility. To enable rapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated pipeline that transforms publicly available artifacts into ready-to-use execution environments in minutes, eliminating weeks of expert configuration traditionally required. We trained LLM-based agents on just 486 high-quality, execution-verified trajectories from CTF-Dojo, achieving up to 11.6% absolute gains over strong baselines across three competitive benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best-performing 32B model reaches 31.9% Pass@1, establishing a new open-weight state-of-the-art that rivals frontier models like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. By framing CTF-style tasks as a benchmark for executable-agent learning, CTF-Dojo demonstrates that execution-grounded training signals are not only effective but pivotal in advancing high-performance ML agents without dependence on costly proprietary systems.</description>

      <title>Universal Dynamics with Globally Controlled Analog Quantum Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment - direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.</description>

      <title>Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for scaling: An application for deducing hydrologic connectivity at watershed scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods have been applied to interpret deep learning model results. However, applications that integrate XAI with established hydrologic knowledge for process understanding remain limited. Here we show that XAI method, applied at point-scale, could be used for cross-scale aggregation of hydrologic responses, a fundamental question in scaling problems, using hydrologic connectivity as a demonstration. Soil moisture and its movement generated by physically based hydrologic model were used to train a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, whose impacts of inputs were evaluated by XAI methods. Our results suggest that XAI-based classification can effectively identify the differences in the functional roles of various sub-regions at watershed scale. The aggregated XAI results could be considered as an explicit and quantitative indicator of hydrologic connectivity development, offering insights to hydrological organization. This framework could be used to facilitate aggregation of other geophysical responses to advance process understandings.</description>

      <title>Agentic DDQN-Based Scheduling for Licensed and Unlicensed Band Allocation in Sidelink Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an agentic double deep Q-network (DDQN) scheduler for licensed/unlicensed band allocation in New Radio (NR) sidelink (SL) networks. Beyond conventional reward-seeking reinforcement learning (RL), the agent perceives and reasons over a multi-dimensional context that jointly captures queueing delay, link quality, coexistence intensity, and switching stability. A capacity-aware, quality of service (QoS)-constrained reward aligns the agent with goal-oriented scheduling rather than static thresholding. Under constrained bandwidth, the proposed design reduces blocking by up to 87.5% versus threshold policies while preserving throughput, highlighting the value of context-driven decisions in coexistence-limited NR SL networks. The proposed scheduler is an embodied agent (E-agent) tailored for task-specific, resource-efficient operation at the network edge.</description>

      <title>LD-ViCE: Latent Diffusion Model for Video Counterfactual Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half. Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.</description>

      <title>MOCHA: Multi-modal Objects-aware Cross-arcHitecture Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MOCHA (Multi-modal Objects-aware Cross-arcHitecture Alignment), a knowledge distillation approach that transfers region-level multimodal semantics from a large vision-language teacher (e.g., LLaVa) into a lightweight vision-only object detector student (e.g., YOLO). A translation module maps student features into a joint space, where the training of the student and translator is guided by a dual-objective loss that enforces both local alignment and global relational consistency. Unlike prior approaches focused on dense or global alignment, MOCHA operates at the object level, enabling efficient transfer of semantics without modifying the teacher or requiring textual input at inference. We validate our method across four personalized detection benchmarks under few-shot regimes. Results show consistent gains over baselines, with a +10.1 average score improvement. Despite its compact architecture, MOCHA reaches performance on par with larger multimodal models, proving its suitability for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>DivLogicEval: A Framework for Benchmarking Logical Reasoning Evaluation in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Logic reasoning in natural language has been recognized as an important measure of human intelligence for Large Language Models (LLMs). Popular benchmarks may entangle multiple reasoning skills and thus provide unfaithful evaluations on the logic reasoning skill. Meanwhile, existing logic reasoning benchmarks are limited in language diversity and their distributions are deviated from the distribution of an ideal logic reasoning benchmark, which may lead to biased evaluation results. This paper thereby proposes a new classical logic benchmark DivLogicEval, consisting of natural sentences composed of diverse statements in a counterintuitive way. To ensure a more reliable evaluation, we also introduce a new evaluation metric that mitigates the influence of bias and randomness inherent in LLMs. Through experiments, we demonstrate the extent to which logical reasoning is required to answer the questions in DivLogicEval and compare the performance of different popular LLMs in conducting logical reasoning.</description>

      <title>Gender and Political Bias in Large Language Models: A Demonstration Platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ParlAI Vote, an interactive system for exploring European Parliament debates and votes, and for testing LLMs on vote prediction and bias analysis. This platform connects debate topics, speeches, and roll-call outcomes, and includes rich demographic data such as gender, age, country, and political group. Users can browse debates, inspect linked speeches, compare real voting outcomes with predictions from frontier LLMs, and view error breakdowns by demographic group. Visualizing the EuroParlVote benchmark and its core tasks of gender classification and vote prediction, ParlAI Vote highlights systematic performance bias in state-of-the-art LLMs. The system unifies data, models, and visual analytics in a single interface, lowering the barrier for reproducing findings, auditing behavior, and running counterfactual scenarios. It supports research, education, and public engagement with legislative decision-making, while making clear both the strengths and the limitations of current LLMs in political analysis.</description>

      <title>Pain in 3D: Generating Controllable Synthetic Faces for Automated Pain Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated pain assessment from facial expressions is crucial for non-communicative patients, such as those with dementia. Progress has been limited by two challenges: (i) existing datasets exhibit severe demographic and label imbalance due to ethical constraints, and (ii) current generative models cannot precisely control facial action units (AUs), facial structure, or clinically validated pain levels.
  We present 3DPain, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for automated pain assessment, featuring unprecedented annotation richness and demographic diversity. Our three-stage framework generates diverse 3D meshes, textures them with diffusion models, and applies AU-driven face rigging to synthesize multi-view faces with paired neutral and pain images, AU configurations, PSPI scores, and the first dataset-level annotations of pain-region heatmaps. The dataset comprises 82,500 samples across 25,000 pain expression heatmaps and 2,500 synthetic identities balanced by age, gender, and ethnicity.
  We further introduce ViTPain, a Vision Transformer based cross-modal distillation framework in which a heatmap-trained teacher guides a student trained on RGB images, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and clinical reliability. Together, 3DPain and ViTPain establish a controllable, diverse, and clinically grounded foundation for generalizable automated pain assessment.</description>

      <title>Min: Mixture of Noise for Pre-Trained Model-Based Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continuously learn new categories while retaining the knowledge of old ones. Pre-trained models (PTMs) show promising capabilities in CIL. However, existing approaches that apply lightweight fine-tuning to backbones still induce parameter drift, thereby compromising the generalization capability of pre-trained models. Parameter drift can be conceptualized as a form of noise that obscures critical patterns learned for previous tasks. However, recent researches have shown that noise is not always harmful. For example, the large number of visual patterns learned from pre-training can be easily abused by a single task, and introducing appropriate noise can suppress some low-correlation features, thus leaving a margin for future tasks. To this end, we propose learning beneficial noise for CIL guided by information theory and propose Mixture of Noise (Min), aiming to mitigate the degradation of backbone generalization from adapting new tasks. Specifically, task-specific noise is learned from high-dimension features of new tasks. Then, a set of weights is adjusted dynamically for optimal mixture of different task noise. Finally, Min embeds the beneficial noise into the intermediate features to mask the response of inefficient patterns. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that Min achieves state-of-the-art performance in most incremental settings, with particularly outstanding results in 50-steps incremental settings. This shows the significant potential for beneficial noise in continual learning. Code is available at https://github.com/ASCIIJK/MiN-NeurIPS2025.</description>

Abstract: This study presents Neural Focused Ant Colony Optimization (NeuFACO), a non-autoregressive framework for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) that combines advanced reinforcement learning with enhanced Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). NeuFACO employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with entropy regularization to train a graph neural network for instance-specific heuristic guidance, which is integrated into an optimized ACO framework featuring candidate lists, restricted tour refinement, and scalable local search. By leveraging amortized inference alongside ACO stochastic exploration, NeuFACO efficiently produces high-quality solutions across diverse TSP instances.</description>

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in critical domains has spurred extensive research into their security issues. While input manipulation attacks (e.g., prompt injection) have been well studied, Bit-Flip Attacks (BFAs) -- which exploit hardware vulnerabilities to corrupt model parameters and cause severe performance degradation -- have received far less attention. Existing BFA methods suffer from key limitations: they fail to balance performance degradation and output naturalness, making them prone to discovery. In this paper, we introduce SilentStriker, the first stealthy bit-flip attack against LLMs that effectively degrades task performance while maintaining output naturalness. Our core contribution lies in addressing the challenge of designing effective loss functions for LLMs with variable output length and the vast output space. Unlike prior approaches that rely on output perplexity for attack loss formulation, which inevitably degrade output naturalness, we reformulate the attack objective by leveraging key output tokens as targets for suppression, enabling effective joint optimization of attack effectiveness and stealthiness. Additionally, we employ an iterative, progressive search strategy to maximize attack efficacy. Experiments show that SilentStriker significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving successful attacks without compromising the naturalness of generated text.</description>

      <title>Bilateral Distribution Compression: Reducing Both Data Size and Dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17543</link>

Abstract: Existing distribution compression methods reduce dataset size by minimising the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between original and compressed sets, but modern datasets are often large in both sample size and dimensionality. We propose Bilateral Distribution Compression (BDC), a two-stage framework that compresses along both axes while preserving the underlying distribution, with overall linear time and memory complexity in dataset size and dimension. Central to BDC is the Decoded MMD (DMMD), which quantifies the discrepancy between the original data and a compressed set decoded from a low-dimensional latent space. BDC proceeds by (i) learning a low-dimensional projection using the Reconstruction MMD (RMMD), and (ii) optimising a latent compressed set with the Encoded MMD (EMMD). We show that this procedure minimises the DMMD, guaranteeing that the compressed set faithfully represents the original distribution. Experiments show that across a variety of scenarios BDC can achieve comparable or superior performance to ambient-space compression at substantially lower cost.</description>

      <title>The Narcissus Hypothesis: Descending to the Rung of Illusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17999</link>

Abstract: Modern foundational models increasingly reflect not just world knowledge, but patterns of human preference embedded in their training data. We hypothesize that recursive alignment-via human feedback and model-generated corpora-induces a social desirability bias, nudging models to favor agreeable or flattering responses over objective reasoning. We refer to it as the Narcissus Hypothesis and test it across 31 models using standardized personality assessments and a novel Social Desirability Bias score. Results reveal a significant drift toward socially conforming traits, with profound implications for corpus integrity and the reliability of downstream inferences. We then offer a novel epistemological interpretation, tracing how recursive bias may collapse higher-order reasoning down Pearl's Ladder of Causality, culminating in what we refer to as the Rung of Illusion.</description>
